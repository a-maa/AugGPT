"The bulldog gets it done.  I can't say enough about this tool.  Its done everything I've asked it to do. From hammering through a 8 in slab, to drilling through  8 in block.Of course, I don't use it everyday like a contractor, but I'de imagine for that kind of use, I'de buy one of the bigger bosch hammers for everyday punishment.  The bits are somewhat pricey, but for good reason, they last!  You will only probably need to buy them once.For occasional to medium use,  this is a winner!",21
"Despite the hefty price tag and prestigious name, this saw won't hold a blade! My first one wouldn't... and neither would the replacement Home Depot gave me. Nothing I did would make a blade stay in. Call to the factory elicited this comment: &quot;Yeah, we get a lot of complaints about that.&quot;  Duh! Tried it one last time and -- the motor went out!  I finallly bought the top-of-the-line Craftsman (made by Bosch) and no such problems -- it's a honey.",21
"My daughter began playing this game at age 6.  She will now play it with anyone who offers!  It is challenging and fun for adults as well.  The only downsides are that you need a fairly large, flat surface to create the tile patterns, and you need to be prepared to play for 30 minutes or more in order to finish a full game.  If you bump the table and jar the tiles, it can really lead to chaos if the game is fairly far-along.  Overall, however, I highly recommend it, even for adults.",22
"We've played a few games of Fluxx and while it is easy to learn and play, it just isn't a very exciting game. The idea that the goal continually changes is neat, but it continually changes so often you really have no way to strategize. It ends up coming down to holding cards in your hand that you can't play so another player won't win, until you have to play something to end the game. Thankfully it wasn't very expensive. This is my first Fluxx style game but I assume all of them are very similar in nature.",22
"This game was very poorly made...it's really boring, because all you do is walk around and throw stuff at things. All the enemies are exactly the same, there's never any health, and 100 health points aren't enough, because the health goes down too fast. The sight of range is ridiculous because half the screen is nothing but fog, and it all just draws in as you walk ahead, making it hard to see enemies. I do like seeing the familiar South Park characters in 3D, the game is very funny, and the weapons are hilarious! But still, I wouldn't buy it. Rent at most.",23
"This was an amazing game when I first got it... a million years ago or so.  Funny thing is, they were talking about Diablo 2 in developement back then, but I didn't see it for at least another 2 and a half years...If you happen to be running a computer that is older than dirt, go ahead and buy this game, I think it is great, but it is way past it's time.  As a matter of fact, I think I saw someone playing it the last time I was in Amish country.",23
"The bulldog performs admirably in all tasks I have assigned it, from breaking through an 8-inch slab to penetrating an 8-inch block. Although I don't use it as frequently as a professional contractor, I would recommend investing in one of the larger Bosch hammers for enduring daily hardship. The drill bits may be somewhat expensive, but they are well worth the cost considering their durability. In all likelihood, you will only have to purchase them once. For intermittent to moderate use, this tool is undoubtedly a top choice.",21
"There is no doubt that the bulldog is a reliable tool. I cannot emphasize enough how impressed I am with its versatility. It has successfully tackled every task I've thrown its way, whether it be demolishing an 8-inch slab or drilling through an 8-inch block. While I don't utilize it on a daily basis like a professional contractor, I would suggest opting for one of the larger Bosch hammers for heavy-duty, everyday usage. The drill bits may be slightly expensive, but they are certainly worth the investment as they have exceptional longevity. Most likely, you will only need to purchase them once. For occasional to moderate use, this tool is the ultimate winner.",21

It has surpassed my expectations by effortlessly hammering through an 8-inch slab and drilling through an 8-inch block. Although I don't implement it in my daily work like a professional contractor, I would imagine that for such intensive usage, it would be wise to invest in one of the larger Bosch hammers capable of withstanding daily punishment.

It has fulfilled all my requests without fail, from demolishing an 8-inch slab to piercing through an 8-inch block. Of course, as an occasional user, I do not utilize it as frequently as a professional contractor would, but I anticipate that for daily use, one should consider purchasing a larger Bosch hammer, specifically designed to withstand regular harsh treatment.

Although the drill bits may be slightly pricy, they are worth every penny since they have exceptional longevity. You will most likely only need to purchase them once. This tool is unbeatable for occasional to moderate use.",21

"Despite its expensive cost and reputable brand, this saw fails to securely hold a blade. Both the original one I had and the replacement provided by Home Depot had the same issue. No matter what I tried, the blade would not stay in place. When I reached out to the manufacturer, they acknowledged receiving numerous complaints about it. As if to add insult to injury, the motor eventually stopped working after one last attempt. In the end, I opted for the high-end Craftsman saw, which is manufactured by Bosch, and it works flawlessly.",21
"This saw, despite its hefty price tag and prestigious name, proved to be quite a disappointment when it came to keeping the blade in place. Neither the first one I had nor the replacement I received from Home Depot managed to solve this problem. No matter what troubleshooting attempts I made, I couldn't stop the blade from coming loose. A call to the factory only confirmed that they had received numerous complaints about this issue. And just when I thought things couldn't get worse, the motor eventually gave out. This forced me to purchase the top-of-the-line Craftsman saw, which is made by Bosch, and thankfully, it has proved to be a reliable investment.",21

My initial purchase as well as the replacement provided by Home Depot both exhibited the same problem. No matter what measures I took, I couldn't keep the blade securely in place. A conversation with the manufacturer revealed their awareness of multiple complaints in this regard. To add insult to injury, the motor unexpectedly malfunctioned after my last attempt. This led me to finally acquire the premium Craftsman saw, which is manufactured by Bosch, and I'm happy to report it has been a trouble-free experience so far.",21

"This saw, despite its expensive price tag and prestigious reputation, utterly fails in holding a blade securely. Not only did the original saw I purchased disappoint, but the replacement I received from Home Depot proved to have the same flaw.

"At the age of 6, my daughter started playing this game and now she willingly plays it with anyone who proposes. It offers a challenging and enjoyable experience for both adults and children alike. The only drawbacks are that you require a reasonably spacious and level surface to construct the tile patterns, and you should be ready to engage in a game lasting at least 30 minutes to complete a full round. If the table is accidentally disturbed and the tiles are jolted, it can cause significant disruption, particularly if the game has progressed significantly. Nonetheless, I wholeheartedly recommend it, even for adults.",22

"Although Fluxx is simple to understand and play, it lacks excitement. The constantly changing goal is interesting, but it changes so frequently that strategic planning is impossible.

"The game's poor quality makes it extremely dull since the only activity involves aimlessly wandering around and throwing projectiles. Moreover, all the enemies lack variety, there is never any health available, and the allocated 100 health points prove insufficient due to their rapid depletion.",23
"The game's construction is highly inadequate, resulting in a monotonous experience where one merely navigates through the environment and hurls objects at objects.

"When I first acquired this game ages ago, it truly impressed me. Ironically, during that era, there were talks about the development of Diablo 2, although I didn't get my hands on it until a good two and a half years later.
