We got it for our son and after one adult driven test drive to see how the controls worked (with no major crashes...a few wall bumps and one ceiling touch, by far nothing hard enough to visibly damage it) and it would not lift off again after that.

"One of the first games released for the Dreamcast, House of the Dead 2 is an instant classic.  The game is identical to the arcade smash with the inclusion of exclusive Dreamcast levels, and the graphics and detailed zombies will leave your mouth watering.  The voice acting is pretty bad though, making the voice acting from the first Resident Evil look like Shakespearian acting, but that is overlooked by the shoot 'em up action.

"I'm extremely let down by this purchase. We bought it for our son and after one test drive led by an adult to understand the controls (with only minor crashes, a few bumps into walls, and one touch of the ceiling, nothing strong enough to cause visible damage), it failed to take off again. Despite having no apparent damage, no stripped gears, and a full charge, it only spun on the ground after the initial 2-minute flight. I've already repackaged it and it is currently being returned to Amazon. Don't waste your money.",22
