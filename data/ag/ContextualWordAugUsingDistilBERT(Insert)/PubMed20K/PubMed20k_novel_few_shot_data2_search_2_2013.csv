Follow-up rate after 5 years was 85 % .,3
This means that callus maturation was 27 % faster in the LIPUS group .,3
"Although behavioral and technological interventions can result in some modest improvements in glycemic control , these interventions did not fare significantly better than usual care in achieving glycemic control .",4
Trial Registration : IRCT.ir IRCT2012071010230N1 .,4
minimum follow - up rate taken after just 5 years probation was 85 %.,3
follow - out up rate after 5 straight years attendance was only 85 %.,3
teacher follow - up up rate applicable after 5 years abroad was 85 %.,3
a follow - off up rate declining after 5 years was around 85 %.,3
median follow - up rate coverage after approximately 5 teenage years was 85 %.,3
satisfaction follow - up rate after 5 consecutive years prep was nearly 85 %.,3
unfortunately this means that mouse callus maturation was increased 27 % faster then in the mammalian lipus virus group.,3
basically this means showing that the callus maturation was progressing 27 % faster in dividing the sperm lipus group.,3
clearly this means highlighting that callus maturation size was already 27 % faster found in the basal lipus group.,3
this means that callus cell maturation was achieved 27 % times faster whereas in the corresponding lipus acid group.,3
this model means showing that late callus maturation time was usually 27 % or faster in the lipus group.,3
this correlation means that callus genome maturation was expected 27 % faster in producing the initial lipus virus group.,3
"although behavioral approaches and functional technological health interventions alone can result in relatively some modest improvements used in performing glycemic impulse control, consistently these interventions did not fare significantly better than usual care in achieving glycemic muscular control.",4
"although consistent behavioral and technological intervention interventions can result in only some exceptionally modest improvements performed in human glycemic impulse control, these interventions did not fare a significantly better treatment than merely usual care in achieving glycemic control.",4
"although advanced behavioral science and technological interventions can result in some or modest improvements in robust glycemic impulse control, nonetheless these interventions did not fare significantly even better than patients usual care in schools achieving optimal glycemic control.",4
"although behavioral and technological hospital interventions likely can also result together in some modest improvements in glycemic cardiovascular control, these interventions did not readily fare for significantly better than usual care alternatives in achieving sustained glycemic cardiovascular control.",4
"– although behavioral therapy and other technological interventions can result upon in some modest statistical improvements in promoting glycemic bloom control, these interventions did not fare with significantly better outcomes than usual care options in achieving glycemic control.",4
"whereas although integrated behavioral and technological interventions can both result ultimately in some modest improvements in glycemic locus control, theoretically these medical interventions did not fare significantly better economically than any usual care indicated in achieving glycemic control.",4
