normal - weight subjects showed significant blood acid oxygen deprivation level - dioxide dependent chemical responses in the lower ventromedial junction prefrontal cortex ( vmpfc ) leading to food aromas compared with responses induced exclusively by the odor effects of an inedible edible object.,3
normal - weight laboratory subjects also showed less significant blood oxygen level - dependent responses in the specialized ventromedial prefrontal temporal cortex ( vmpfc ) compared to food aromas compared with responses induced largely by the odor cues of either an inedible chemical object.,3
normal - weight subjects showed significant blood sugar oxygen level - exposure dependent responses in ascending the ventromedial temporal prefrontal cortex ( termed vmpfc ) prior to strong food aromas before compared overall with responses induced by the penetrating odor of an inedible object.,3
normal - weight subjects showed significant blood oxygen restriction level - dependent responses in the ventromedial prefrontal cortex ( specifically vmpfc ) to detect food aromas compared with actual responses perhaps induced purely by the slightest odor of or an extremely inedible odor object.,3
normal - weight subjects showed distinctly significant blood oxygen level - type dependent responses in the ventromedial pigment prefrontal secret cortex ( vmpfc ) to food component aromas compared with physiological responses induced by increasing the odor level of an occasionally inedible living object.,3
male normal - weight subjects showed significant blood oxygen meter level - dependent responses typically in the ventral ventromedial tracts prefrontal cortex ( v vmpfc ) specific to food aromas compared directly with responses induced solely by the odor of an inedible solid object.,3

"prep is potentially efficacious advocate for hiv - 1 prevention among women using dmpa and men whose partners use reducing dmpa, suggesting prep could greatly mitigate the potential increased hiv - 1 antigen acquisition targets and transmission risks that both have been reportedly associated similarly with decreased dmpa use.",4
