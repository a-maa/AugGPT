Follow-up rate after 5 years was 85 % .,3
This means that callus maturation was 27 % faster in the LIPUS group .,3
"Although behavioral and technological interventions can result in some modest improvements in glycemic control , these interventions did not fare significantly better than usual care in achieving glycemic control .",4
