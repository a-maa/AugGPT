"The bulldog gets it done.  I can't say enough about this tool.  Its done everything I've asked it to do. From hammering through a 8 in slab, to drilling through  8 in block.Of course, I don't use it everyday like a contractor, but I'de imagine for that kind of use, I'de buy one of the bigger bosch hammers for everyday punishment.  The bits are somewhat pricey, but for good reason, they last!  You will only probably need to buy them once.For occasional to medium use,  this is a winner!",21
"Despite the hefty price tag and prestigious name, this saw won't hold a blade! My first one wouldn't... and neither would the replacement Home Depot gave me. Nothing I did would make a blade stay in. Call to the factory elicited this comment: &quot;Yeah, we get a lot of complaints about that.&quot;  Duh! Tried it one last time and -- the motor went out!  I finallly bought the top-of-the-line Craftsman (made by Bosch) and no such problems -- it's a honey.",21
"My daughter began playing this game at age 6.  She will now play it with anyone who offers!  It is challenging and fun for adults as well.  The only downsides are that you need a fairly large, flat surface to create the tile patterns, and you need to be prepared to play for 30 minutes or more in order to finish a full game.  If you bump the table and jar the tiles, it can really lead to chaos if the game is fairly far-along.  Overall, however, I highly recommend it, even for adults.",22
"We've played a few games of Fluxx and while it is easy to learn and play, it just isn't a very exciting game. The idea that the goal continually changes is neat, but it continually changes so often you really have no way to strategize. It ends up coming down to holding cards in your hand that you can't play so another player won't win, until you have to play something to end the game. Thankfully it wasn't very expensive. This is my first Fluxx style game but I assume all of them are very similar in nature.",22
"This game was very poorly made...it's really boring, because all you do is walk around and throw stuff at things. All the enemies are exactly the same, there's never any health, and 100 health points aren't enough, because the health goes down too fast. The sight of range is ridiculous because half the screen is nothing but fog, and it all just draws in as you walk ahead, making it hard to see enemies. I do like seeing the familiar South Park characters in 3D, the game is very funny, and the weapons are hilarious! But still, I wouldn't buy it. Rent at most.",23
"This was an amazing game when I first got it... a million years ago or so.  Funny thing is, they were talking about Diablo 2 in developement back then, but I didn't see it for at least another 2 and a half years...If you happen to be running a computer that is older than dirt, go ahead and buy this game, I think it is great, but it is way past it's time.  As a matter of fact, I think I saw someone playing it the last time I was in Amish country.",23
"the bulldog gets it and done. i can't say enough about this tool. its done everything i've asked it to do. from hammering through a 8 in slab, to drilling through another 8 in block. of course, i don't use it everyday like a contractor, but i'd de to imagine for that kind of use, as i'de always buy one instead of the bigger bosch hammers for everyday punishment. generally the bits are somewhat pricey, but but for good that reason, they last! you will only probably need to buy them once. for occasional to medium use, this is a winner!",21
"so the bulldog always gets it done. i can't say enough about liking this tool. its done everything i've asked it to do. from hammering through a 8 in slab, to drilling through 8 in block. of course, i don't use it everyday like a contractor, but i'de imagine for more that kind of use, unless i'de rather buy one of the bigger bosch hammers for everyday punishment. the bits are actually somewhat pricey, but for good reason, they last! you folks will only probably need to buy them once. for occasional to medium day use, this is already a winner!",21
"the bulldog gets it done. i can'bal t say enough about this tool. its done everything i've asked it to do. from hammering through a 8 in slab slab, to actually drilling 4 through 8 in block. of course, i don't use it everyday like a contractor, but i'de imagine for now that extra kind of regular use, i'de buy one of the bigger bosch hammers for everyday punishment. the bits are somewhat pricey, but for good reason, they last! you will only probably need it to buy them once. for occasional to medium time use, this is a serious winner!",21
"the bulldog gets it best done. i can't say enough about this tool. its done almost everything i'ha ve asked it ever to do. from us hammering through a 8 inch in slab, to drilling through 8 in block. of course, i don't use it everyday like a contractor, but later i'de imagine but for that kind of use, i'de buy one of the bigger bosch hammers for everyday punishment. the bits are somewhat pricey, but only for good reason, they last! you will only probably need to actually buy them once. for occasional to medium use, this is a winner!",21
"the bulldog gets it done. although i can'can t say enough about this tool. its done everything i'l ve asked into it to do. from hammering through a 8 in slab, to drilling through a 8 in block. of course, i don't use it everyday just like a contractor, but i'de imagine for that kind of use, i'de buy one instead of the many bigger bosch hammers for everyday physical punishment. the bits are somewhat pricey, but for good reason, they last! you will only probably only need to buy them once. for occasional to medium use, this is a winner!",21
"the bulldog gets... it done. i honestly can't say enough about this tool. its done everything i've asked it to just do. from 1 hammering holes through a full 8 in slab, to drilling through 8 in block. of course, i don't use it everyday like being a contractor, but i'de imagine for that kind of use, i'de buy one of the bigger bosch hammers for everyday punishment. the little bits are somewhat pricey, but for good reason, they last! you will only probably need to buy one them once. for occasional to medium use, yeah this is a winner!",21

"my daughter carolyn began playing this game at age 6. she will come now play it with absolutely anyone interested who offers! it is challenging and fun enough for adults as well. the only downsides are that you need a fairly large, flat surface to create properly the tile patterns, and you need to be prepared to play for 30 minutes or more in order to finish a full game. if you bump the playing table and jar the tiles, it can really lead to chaos if the game is fairly damn far - along. just overall, however, i highly recommend it, even for younger adults.",22
"since my daughter began playing this game at age 6. she will now probably play it with anyone who ever offers! it is challenging and obviously fun for adults quite as our well. the only downsides are that you need a fairly large, flat surface to create only the tile patterns, and you need to be prepared to play for 30 minutes or more often in order to finish a full game. if you bump the table and jar the tiles, it can really lead to chaos as if once the game is fairly far - along. overall, however, i highly recommend it, even for adults.",22

"we've played a few different games of fluxx and while it is easy to learn and play, it just isn't a very exciting game. the idea of that the goal continually changes is neat, but it continually changes so often you really have no way to strategize. it ends up just coming down hard to holding cards in your hand that you can't safely play so another player won't win, until you have to play something special to end the game. thankfully it wasn't very quietly expensive. this is my first official fluxx style game but i assume all of them there are very physically similar in nature.",22
