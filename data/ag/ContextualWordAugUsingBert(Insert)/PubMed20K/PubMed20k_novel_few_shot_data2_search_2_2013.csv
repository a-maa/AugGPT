follow - up rate even after compulsory 5 ¹⁄₂ years school was 85 %.,3
their follow - off up rate repeated after following 5 years was 85 %.,3
her follow - was up rate after 5 years old was approximately 85 %.,3
follow - of up rate after just 5 years old was almost 85 %.,3
his follow - follow up rate after 5 plus years was below 85 %.,3
follow - up pass rate only after 5 pre years pass was 85 %.,3
this means considering that each callus maturation was 27 % the faster in dividing the core lipus stem group.,3
this means that total callus mediated maturation progression was often 27 % faster in all the lipus member group.,3
all this means that callus male maturation rate was 27 % faster even in the original lipus study group.,3
surprisingly this correlation means that human callus maturation rates was almost 27 % faster even in the lipus group.,3
this evidence means that in callus group maturation was always 27 % or faster in entering the lipus group.,3
this means rather that wild callus maturation was 27 % or faster found in the typical lipus species group.,3
"although some behavioral and improved technological interventions can result partly in some comparatively modest improvements produced in glycemic control, and these latter interventions did not fare around significantly better than usual care in children achieving glycemic quality control.",4
"but although behavioral and physical technological interventions can result in in quite some modest outcomes improvements shown in glycemic control, these interventions did apparently not fare more significantly at better than for usual care in achieving glycemic control.",4
"so although most behavioral and technological interventions can naturally result in only some modest efficiency improvements dramatically in glycemic control, these behavioral interventions sometimes did not generally fare significantly better than usual care procedures in achieving glycemic control.",4
"and although mainstream behavioral and even technological therapy interventions can theoretically result in some comparatively modest improvements in glycemic control, these latter interventions did not fare any significantly better than most usual care in doctors achieving glycemic control.",4
"although conventional behavioral interventions and technological interventions usually can result in doing some modest improvements still in glycemic control, however these interventions typically did not fare significantly better results than usual care systems in achieving glycemic lateral control.",4
"although behavioral adaptive and technological interventions themselves can theoretically result in some modest potential improvements compared in glycemic control, these new interventions did sometimes not ever fare significantly better than usual health care in achieving glycemic damage control.",4
