Normal-weight subjects showed significant blood oxygen level-dependent responses in the ventromedial prefrontal cortex ( vmPFC ) to food aromas compared with responses induced by the odor of an inedible object .,3

normal - weight subjects also showed some significant blood oxygen level - dependent responses especially in the external ventromedial prefrontal muscular cortex ( hence vmpfc ) sensitive to food aromas compared earlier with negative responses induced by the odor of filling an inedible object.,3
normal - stock weight subjects showed significant blood with oxygen level - dependent reflex responses increased in specifically the ventromedial collateral prefrontal cortex ( cn vmpfc ) to food chain aromas compared with responses normally induced by the odor of an initially inedible object.,3
normal - weight study subjects likewise showed only significant blood oxygen level - dependent responses in scanning the anterior ventromedial prefrontal cortex ( of vmpfc ) to food aromas also compared with blood responses induced by the odor effects of consuming an inedible object.,3
normal - weight subjects showed moderately significant blood oxygen level - dependent aromatic responses in vitro the right ventromedial motor prefrontal regional cortex ( vmpfc ) responses to food aromas compared with asthma responses induced by the associated odor of an inedible living object.,3
normal - birth weight reported subjects showed only significant decreased blood oxygen level - dependent responses whereas in the right ventromedial prefrontal cortex ( vmpfc ) to food odor aromas were compared with responses induced by the odor content of an inedible household object.,3
reported normal - weight subjects both showed some significant blood level oxygen level - dependent responses observed in the superior ventromedial prefrontal contact cortex ( medial vmpfc ) attributed to food aromas compared with responses usually induced by the odor of an inedible object.,3
