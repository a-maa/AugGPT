normal - weight subjects showed heightened passive oxygen channel - dependent responses in the inferior prefrontal cortex ( cr ) to food contamination associated with responses induced resembling the odor of any adult object.,3
normal - weight infants have poor metabolic oxygen level - dependent integration of the ventromedial prefrontal cortex ( vmpfc ) to food foods compared versus exposure induced by the decomposition of an inedible object.,3
normal - weight studies showed observed breath oxygen utilization - lowering responses in systemic ventromedial prefrontal cortex ( sts ) to food odor compared with responses induced upon the odor of an inedible perfume.,3
medium - weight extracts induce significant blood glucose deprivation - dependent responses in frontal ventromedial primary cortex ( vmpfc ) to food sources compared with responses induced by an odor of an inedible substance.,3
slow - onset patients showed significant blood oxygen level - dependent reduction of the ventromedial prefrontal cortex ( vmpfc ) to food intake compared adults that induced into the odor of less inedible object.,3
normal - weight subjects experience similar respiratory oxygen supply - dependent responses using one ventromedial motor cortex ( vmpfc ) to food consumption compared with those induced by the odor from an inedible object.,3
