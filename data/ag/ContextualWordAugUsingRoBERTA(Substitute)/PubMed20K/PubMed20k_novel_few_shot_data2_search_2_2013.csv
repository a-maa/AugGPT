This suggests cell callus maturation was 700 nm faster within the LIPUS group :,3
This means that callus damage was 42 % higher using the LIPUS strain in,3
This implies that white maturation was 4 % faster with the stress test.,3
This mean that bone maturation was 27 times slower in the chicken pool.,3
This means that brain surgery was 27 % faster within each male group...,3
This very pure callus migration proceeds 27 % faster in this LIPUS group of,3
Although nutrition and other interventions can result yield some modest improvements in glycemic control - these subjects did less fare uniformly better the usual care in achieving glycemic stability -,4
"Although behavioral and technological interventions can bring in clinically modest improvements in glycemic response, no interventions have all perform significantly better than usual and in adjusting these control.",4
Although behavioral and technological interventions can manifest in some modest improvements on calorie control these particular strategies did not fare substantially different than traditional care in achieving glycemic control :,4
Although behavioral and technological interventions does confer in some modest improvements over glycemic control [] these interventions need not fare significantly greater then usual care toward improving glycemic neutrality.,4
"Although typically some therapeutic interventions primarily derive from very modest success in glycemic control, these interventions did not fare significantly better vs usual care in achieving glycemic sensitivity.",4
"Although more like occupational interventions can result in some substantial improvements in quality control, most interventions must indeed achieve significantly better than usual interventions in achieving glycemic control.",4
