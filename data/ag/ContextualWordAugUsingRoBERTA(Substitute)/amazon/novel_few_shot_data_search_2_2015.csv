"The bulldog gets it done.  I can't say enough about this tool.  Its done everything I've asked it to do. From hammering through a 8 in slab, to drilling through  8 in block.Of course, I don't use it everyday like a contractor, but I'de imagine for that kind of use, I'de buy one of the bigger bosch hammers for everyday punishment.  The bits are somewhat pricey, but for good reason, they last!  You will only probably need to buy them once.For occasional to medium use,  this is a winner!",21
"Despite the hefty price tag and prestigious name, this saw won't hold a blade! My first one wouldn't... and neither would the replacement Home Depot gave me. Nothing I did would make a blade stay in. Call to the factory elicited this comment: &quot;Yeah, we get a lot of complaints about that.&quot;  Duh! Tried it one last time and -- the motor went out!  I finallly bought the top-of-the-line Craftsman (made by Bosch) and no such problems -- it's a honey.",21

"We've played a few games of Fluxx and while it is easy to learn and play, it just isn't a very exciting game. The idea that the goal continually changes is neat, but it continually changes so often you really have no way to strategize. It ends up coming down to holding cards in your hand that you can't play so another player won't win, until you have to play something to end the game. Thankfully it wasn't very expensive. This is my first Fluxx style game but I assume all of them are very similar in nature.",22
"This game was very poorly made...it's really boring, because all you do is walk around and throw stuff at things. All the enemies are exactly the same, there's never any health, and 100 health points aren't enough, because the health goes down too fast. The sight of range is ridiculous because half the screen is nothing but fog, and it all just draws in as you walk ahead, making it hard to see enemies. I do like seeing the familiar South Park characters in 3D, the game is very funny, and the weapons are hilarious! But still, I wouldn't buy it. Rent at most.",23
"This was an amazing game when I first got it... a million years ago or so.  Funny thing is, they were talking about Diablo 2 in developement back then, but I didn't see it for at least another 2 and a half years...If you happen to be running a computer that is older than dirt, go ahead and buy this game, I think it is great, but it is way past it's time.  As a matter of fact, I think I saw someone playing it the last time I was in Amish country.",23

"The bulldog gets it done.  I dont say enough about this tool.  Its done everything You asked it to do.

"Despite the hefty mounting tag and prestigious name, this saw does hold a blade! My other one wouldn't... and neither would the replacement Home Depot told me.

"My bride began playing this game at age 6.  She will now play it – anyone who likes!  It is easy enough fun for teens as well.  The only downsides are � you need a fairly large, flat surface to create the tile patterns, and you need to be prepared to play for 30 minutes or more in order to finish your full game.  If you stack the table and jar your tiles, it can really lead to chaos if the game is fairly far-along.  Overall, however, I highly recommend it, even for adults.",22
"My daughter began playing our game at age 6.  She will now play it with anyone who offers!  It is free and fun for adults as well.  The only downsides are — the need be fairly large, flat surface to create the tile patterns, and you need to be prepared to play for 50 minutes or more in order to finish a full game.  If you bump the table and slide the tiles, it can really lead to chaos if the game appears fairly sing-along.  Overall, however, I highly recommend this, even for adults.",22
"My daughter began playing this game at age 6.  She will now play it for anyone that wants!  It is challenging and fun for others as well.  The only downsides are that you need a fairly large, level surface to create the tile patterns, and you need to be motivated to play for 30 minutes or more in order to finish a successful game.  If you bump the table and jar the tiles, you can really lead to chaos if the game ends fairly far-along.  Ultimately, however, I highly recommend it, even for adults.",22

"We've played a few rounds of Fluxx and while it is easy to learn and play, it just isn't a very exciting thing. The idea that the goal continually changes is neat, but it continually changes so often you really have no way to strategize.
