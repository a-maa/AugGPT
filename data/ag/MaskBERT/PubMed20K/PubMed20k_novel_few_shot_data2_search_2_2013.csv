The follow-up rate after 5 years was 85%.,3
This means that the maturation of calluses was 27% faster in the LIPUS group.,3
"While behavioral and technological interventions can lead to some modest improvements in glycemic control, these interventions have not performed much better than conventional prevention in achieving glycemic control.",4
Test Registration: IRCT.ir IRCT2012071010230N1.,4
The study showed a follow-up rate of 85% after 5 years.,3
The 5-year follow-up rate was found to be significantly high at 85%.,3
The participants had an impressive follow-up rate of 85% after 5 years.,3
The data indicated a follow-up rate of 85% 5 years post-study.,3
"The 5-year follow-up rate was recorded as 85%, according to the findings.",3
The results of the study showed a follow-up rate of 85% after a 5-year period.,3
The LIPUS group showed a 27% acceleration in callus maturation.
The results revealed that the callus maturation process was 27% faster in the LIPUS group.,3
The study found that the callus maturation rate in the LIPUS group was 27% quicker.,3
Callus maturation was 27% more rapid in the LIPUS group compared to others.,3
"The callus maturation process in the LIPUS group was 27% more efficient, according to the results.",3
The findings showed that the LIPUS group had a 27% increased speed in callus maturation.,3
"The study found that although behavioral and technological interventions led to some slight improvements in glycemic control, they were not significantly more effective than typical care.",4
"Despite the modest improvement in glycemic control through behavioral and technological interventions, they did not perform better than the standard care.",4
"The results showed that while behavioral and technological interventions resulted in some minimal gains in glycemic control, they did not surpass the usual care in achieving glycemic control.",4
"Although behavioral and technological interventions showed some improvement in glycemic control, they were not found to be significantly superior to the usual care.",4
"The study showed that the usual care was not outperformed by behavioral and technological interventions in terms of achieving glycemic control, despite some small improvements.",4
"The results indicated that the usual care was not outperformed by behavioral and technological interventions in glycemic control, despite some modest improvements.",4
