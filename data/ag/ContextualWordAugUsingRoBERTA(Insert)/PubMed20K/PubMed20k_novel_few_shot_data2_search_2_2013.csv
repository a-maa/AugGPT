Follow-up rate after 5 years was 85 % .,3
This means that callus maturation was 27 % faster in the LIPUS group .,3

Follow-up rate after > 5 consecutive years was approximately 85 per %.,3
Follow-up test rate after 5 years was 98 85 34 % for.,3
Follow-up rate dropped after 5 years and was below 85 per %.,3
Follow-up data rate average after 5 years was approximately 85 per %.,3
Follow-up incidence rate (%) after 5 ½ years was 85 per %.,3
Follow-up rate after another 5 years alone was at 85 4 %.,3
This means that that total callus gene maturation time was almost 27 % and faster in the LIPUS group.,3
This means that callus sample maturation ratio was actually 27 % faster directly in the LIPUS test group from.,3
This means furthermore that the callus maturation data was almost 27 % faster in the primary LIPUS group.,3
This means that callus body maturation rate was ~ 27 % each faster in for the LIPUS group than.,3
This discovery means that male callus muscle maturation was indeed 27 % more faster in than the LIPUS group.,3
This means that advanced callus tissue maturation also was 27 % times faster in the female LIPUS 1 group.,3
