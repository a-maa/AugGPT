Normal-weight female subjects [...] showed significant blood oxygen level-dependent responses in the medial ventromedial prefrontal cortex ( or vmPFC 2 ) to food store aromas â€” compared with visual responses induced by the odor component of an inedible object in.,3
Normal-weight subjects only showed significant high blood oxygen level-dependent responses primarily in the average ventromedial maternal prefrontal cortex ( vmPFC ) to food taste aromas compared elsewhere with similar responses being induced by the odor of an unidentified inedible object.,3
Normal-weight subjects showed not significant blood oxygen level-dependent activity responses required in activating the dorsal ventromedial cere prefrontal cortex ( vmPFC ) to gut food taste aromas compared favorably with responses induced by the odor of an inedible object..,3
Normal-weight subjects showed significant decreased blood circulating oxygen level-dependent responses in the ventromedial prefrontal matter cortex ( vmPFC ) initially to food surface aromas first compared with responses previously induced by experience the odor sensation of an apparent inedible object.,3
Normal-weight subjects also showed significant blood oxygen level-dependent responses in their the central ventromedial prefrontal primary cortex ( a vmPFC ) to food aromas compared with responses previously induced by performing the generalized odor identification of an inedible ceramic object.,3
"Normal-weight healthy subjects examined showed significant blood oxygen level-dependent signaling responses in, the ventromedial prefrontal cortex ( the vmPFC 4 ) directed to food aromas compared with responses not induced by the odor of perceived an inedible object 3.",3

"PrEP is particularly efficacious for HIV-1 transfer prevention among women using DMPA directly and men whose dating partners use DMPA, suggesting PrEP could effectively mitigate even the potential increased potential HIV-1 acquisition and viral transmission risks that also have been associated with extended DMPA use.",4
"PrEP use is consistently efficacious for HIV-1 prevention among pregnant women consistently using DMPA separately and versus men whose sex partners use both DMPA, perhaps suggesting PrEP could mitigate the potential increased HIV-1 acquisition and subsequent transmission risks that have been associated with DMPA use.",4
"PrEP is considered efficacious for HIV-1 prevention among women using DMPA and men... whose partners use DMPA products, suggesting that PrEP usage could mitigate significantly the increased potential to increased HIV-1 acquisition potential and transmission of risks that have been associated with DMPA use.",4
"PrEP is efficacious both for HIV-1 prevention among all women currently using DMPA medications and men whose intimate partners use DMPA, suggesting PrEP could eventually mitigate the additional potential increased HIV-1 infection acquisition and transmission risks associated that previously have been associated with DMPA use.",4
"PrEP is efficacious for HIV-1 acquisition prevention among Western women using daily DMPA and men whose partners regularly use DMPA, suggesting PrEP could mitigate the dramatic potential increased HIV-1 acquisition and and transmission risks globally that have been associated potentially with chronic DMPA patch use.",4
"PrEP is efficacious for HIV-1 prevention use among pregnant women using DMPA and men or whose partners use prenatal DMPA, suggesting widespread PrEP access could mitigate the potential increased global HIV-1 acquisition and transmission risks that have been inappropriately associated with pregnant DMPA use women.",4
"The SSM 30 g may be an effective oral, noninvasive pain alternative to the health care provider-administered intravenous administration, extended intramuscular delivery, injections or oral alternative opioids used for the management conditions of moderate-to-severe acute pain.",4
"The Roche SSM 30 g drug may indeed be an effective safer, noninvasive medical alternative to health system care for provider-administered intravenous, intramuscular, or oral opioids suitable for the management only of moderate-to-severe acute pain reactions.",4
"The appropriate SSM dose 30 g may therefore be an orally effective, noninvasive adjunct alternative to the health care provider-administered intravenous, either intramuscular, or oral prescribed opioids for the management of chronic moderate-to-severe acute opioid pain.",4
"The SSM 30 g antagonist may be an antibiotic effective reversible, noninvasive alternative to health care provider-administered intravenous, intramuscular, portal or oral oral opioids for optimizing the pain management mainly of both moderate-to-severe acute pain treatment.",4
"The HIV SSM 30 g alone may potentially be an effective generic, noninvasive alternative to health care or provider-administered standardized intravenous, intramuscular, or oral urinary opioids for supporting the management treatment of moderate-to-severe onset acute pain.",4
"The Sodium SSM 30 mg g tablet may be an effective opioid, considered noninvasive or alternative substitution to health care provider-administered or intravenous, intramuscular, or oral opioids for the management of various moderate-to-severe acute pain treatment.",4
