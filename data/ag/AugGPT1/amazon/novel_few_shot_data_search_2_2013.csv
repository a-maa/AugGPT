"Very easy to setup and though I have never done stairs before I was able to finish my stairs (cutting and fitting) in one afternoon.  It was a total of 19 treads and risers.  My neighbor had a pro do his stairs.  Took the pro over 3 weeks as he cut the boards wrong and they had to reorder the treads.  He came over to see mine thought my stairs were done much better.  Doing stairs, get it.  Ignore whiney reviews about quality.  The shipping tube it comes in will protect it.",21

"This is the only car racing game you every need.  It can be taught in minuets to new players.  The game is at its heart a dice rolling game, so some of the decisions are out of your control but there is still enough strategy to make it feel like you are in control of your car.  The extra tracks are a most, the Germany and Spain expansion are very good tracks.  This is one of the few games that can play up to 10 players, which is super fun.",22
"I'm really disappointed in this.  We got it for our son and after one adult driven test drive to see how the controls worked (with no major crashes...a few wall bumps and one ceiling touch, by far nothing hard enough to visibly damage it) and it would not lift off again after that.  No visible damage, no gears stripped, full charge...all it would do after the first 2 minute flight was spin on the ground.  It's repackaged and on it's way back to Amazon as I type.  Save your money.",22

This is a must have game for all star wars fans.If you liked this game then check out all of the other Star wars games",23
"One of the first games released for the Dreamcast, House of the Dead 2 is an instant classic.  The game is identical to the arcade smash with the inclusion of exclusive Dreamcast levels, and the graphics and detailed zombies will leave your mouth watering.  The voice acting is pretty bad though, making the voice acting from the first Resident Evil look like Shakespearian acting, but that is overlooked by the shoot 'em up action.  A light gun is strongly recommended, but the standard DC controler works just as well, somewhat.",23
"Despite having no prior experience with stairs, I managed to complete the cutting and fitting of my 19 treads and risers in just one afternoon, making the setup process very easy for me.",21

"My desire for a fence to accompany my Jet band saw has been shattered after carefully examining all 36 reviews. It's quite disappointing to realize that Jet customer service shows minimal regard for their customers. Considering this, I won't be wasting my money on their attachment.",21
"Even though I own a Jet band saw and harbored dreams of adding a fence to my collection, reading the 36 reviews has completely changed my perspective. It's evident that Jet customer service couldn't care less about resolving these customer complaints. Therefore, Mr. Jet customer service person, they can take their attachment and place it somewhere rather unpleasant.",21
"As a former John Deere salesman and partsman, I understand the importance of treating customers well. If I had ever treated my customers the way Jet customer service does, we would have had to close our doors in no time. It's disappointing that Jet doesn't prioritize their customers' concerns.",21
"Despite my ownership of a Jet band saw and yearning for a fence, reading all 36 reviews has altered my thoughts entirely. The complete disregard shown by Jet customer service towards their customers is disheartening.

"I find myself greatly disappointed by this product. We purchased it for our son and, unfortunately, after a test drive conducted by an adult to familiarize ourselves with the controls (resulting in only a few minor bumps against walls and a touch against the ceiling, no significant damage occurred), it failed to take off again. Despite a full charge and no visible damage or stripped gears, it simply spun on the ground after its initial 2-minute flight. Consequently, we are returning it to Amazon as I write this, and I would advise you to save your money. ",22
"This product has left me thoroughly disappointed. We bought it for our son, and after a single test drive controlled by an adult to understand its controls (causing a few minor collisions with walls, and a gentle touch against the ceiling, without any noticeable harm), it refused to take flight again. Even though no damage or stripped gears were visible, and despite being fully charged, it only spun on the ground following its brief 2-minute flight. As a result, we have promptly repackaged it and initiated its return to Amazon. I suggest you refrain from spending your money on it.",22
"The level of disappointment I feel towards this item is quite high. Intended for our son, it failed to meet our expectations when, after a trial drive conducted by an adult to familiarize ourselves with the controls (resulting in negligible collisions against walls and a gentle touch against the ceiling, leaving no visible damage), it refused to take off again. Despite being fully charged, with no evident damage or stripped gears, the only action it performed after a mere 2 minutes of flight was spinning on the ground. Without delay, we have resealed the package and dispatched it back to Amazon. My advice to you would be to avoid wasting your money on it.",22
"This product has left me feeling extremely let down. We purchased it with the intention of giving it to our son, but unfortunately, after a single test drive steered by an adult to ascertain familiarity with the controls (minimal crashes against walls and a slight collision with the ceiling, resulting in no visible damage whatsoever), it failed to take off again. Despite being fully charged and exhibiting no signs of damage or stripped gears, its sole action after the initial 2-minute flight was to spin on the ground. Consequently, we have promptly repackaged it and sent it back to Amazon. I strongly advise you not to waste your money on it.",22
"My disappointment in this product is profound. It was bought for our son, and following an experimental drive by an adult to determine how the controls functioned (causing only minor impacts with walls and a brief contact with the ceiling, which did not result in any noticeable damage), it refused to take flight again. Despite being fully charged and showing no visible damage or stripped gears, its behavior after the initial 2-minute flight solely consisted of spinning on the ground. As I type this, it is being resealed and returned to Amazon. It is advisable not to invest your money in it.",22
"The extent of my disappointment with this item cannot be overstated. Our purchase was intended for our son, but unfortunately, after undergoing a test drive conducted by an adult to familiarize ourselves with the controls (resulting in a few minor collisions against walls and a negligible brush against the ceiling, causing no discernible harm), it refused to launch again. Despite being fully charged, with no apparent damage or stripped gears, all it did after the initial 2-minute flight was spin on the ground. As I am typing this, we have already repackaged it and it is en route back to Amazon. I urge you to hold onto your money and refrain from purchasing it.",22
