"The bulldog gets it done.  I can't say enough about this tool.  Its done everything I've asked it to do. From hammering through a 8 in slab, to drilling through  8 in block.Of course, I don't use it everyday like a contractor, but I'de imagine for that kind of use, I'de buy one of the bigger bosch hammers for everyday punishment.  The bits are somewhat pricey, but for good reason, they last!  You will only probably need to buy them once.For occasional to medium use,  this is a winner!",21
"Despite the hefty price tag and prestigious name, this saw won't hold a blade! My first one wouldn't... and neither would the replacement Home Depot gave me. Nothing I did would make a blade stay in. Call to the factory elicited this comment: &quot;Yeah, we get a lot of complaints about that.&quot;  Duh! Tried it one last time and -- the motor went out!  I finallly bought the top-of-the-line Craftsman (made by Bosch) and no such problems -- it's a honey.",21
"My daughter began playing this game at age 6.  She will now play it with anyone who offers!  It is challenging and fun for adults as well.  The only downsides are that you need a fairly large, flat surface to create the tile patterns, and you need to be prepared to play for 30 minutes or more in order to finish a full game.  If you bump the table and jar the tiles, it can really lead to chaos if the game is fairly far-along.  Overall, however, I highly recommend it, even for adults.",22
"We've played a few games of Fluxx and while it is easy to learn and play, it just isn't a very exciting game. The idea that the goal continually changes is neat, but it continually changes so often you really have no way to strategize. It ends up coming down to holding cards in your hand that you can't play so another player won't win, until you have to play something to end the game. Thankfully it wasn't very expensive. This is my first Fluxx style game but I assume all of them are very similar in nature.",22
"This game was very poorly made...it's really boring, because all you do is walk around and throw stuff at things. All the enemies are exactly the same, there's never any health, and 100 health points aren't enough, because the health goes down too fast. The sight of range is ridiculous because half the screen is nothing but fog, and it all just draws in as you walk ahead, making it hard to see enemies. I do like seeing the familiar South Park characters in 3D, the game is very funny, and the weapons are hilarious! But still, I wouldn't buy it. Rent at most.",23
"This was an amazing game when I first got it... a million years ago or so.  Funny thing is, they were talking about Diablo 2 in developement back then, but I didn't see it for at least another 2 and a half years...If you happen to be running a computer that is older than dirt, go ahead and buy this game, I think it is great, but it is way past it's time.  As a matter of fact, I think I saw someone playing it the last time I was in Amish country.",23
The bulldog accomplishes the task effectively.,21
I cannot emphasize enough the usefulness of this tool.,21
"This tool has successfully accomplished every task I have assigned to it, from hammering through an 8 inch slab to drilling through an 8 inch block.",21
"While I do not use it on a daily basis like a contractor would, I imagine that for that level of use, it would be wise to invest in one of the larger Bosch hammers for more consistent and heavy-duty tasks.",21
"The bits for this tool are slightly expensive, but they are worth the price due to their durability. In fact, you may only need to purchase them once.",21
"If you require a hammer drill for occasional to medium use, this tool is a top choice.",21
"Despite its expensive price and reputable brand, this saw fails to securely hold a blade. The initial one I owned and the replacement from Home Depot both had the same issue. Regardless of my attempts, the blade refused to remain in place. When I contacted the factory, they casually mentioned receiving numerous complaints about it. Not surprisingly, I decided to give it one final try, only to have the motor fail on me. In the end, I ended up purchasing the high-end Craftsman saw, which is actually manufactured by Bosch, and I must say, it functions flawlessly.",21
"This particular saw, despite its considerable price tag and prestigious name, falls short in holding a blade properly. Both the first one I acquired and the replacement provided by Home Depot proved to be inadequate. Despite my various attempts, I couldn't manage to keep a blade secured in it. Upon reaching out to the factory for assistance, they informed me that they frequently receive complaints regarding this issue. As expected, I decided to attempt one last try, only to have the motor suddenly stop working! Eventually, I decided to invest in the top-of-the-line Craftsman saw, which interestingly enough, is produced by Bosch, and I can confidently say that it functions impeccably.",21
"This saw, despite its hefty price tag and prestigious reputation, disappoints in holding a blade properly. Neither the first one I purchased nor the replacement from Home Depot proved to be successful. Regardless of my efforts, the blade simply wouldn't stay in place. After contacting the factory, I was informed that they receive a significant number of complaints regarding this issue. Not surprisingly, during one final attempt, the motor unexpectedly stopped working. In the end, I made the decision to invest in the premium Craftsman saw, which is curiously manufactured by Bosch, and I must admit, it performs exceptionally well.",21
"With its expensive price tag and esteemed brand, this saw fails in its ability to secure a blade. The first one I obtained as well as the replacement from Home Depot were both unsuccessful. No matter how hard I tried, I couldn't manage to keep a blade in place. Upon reaching out to the factory, they casually mentioned that they receive plenty of complaints about this matter. Unsurprisingly, during my last attempt, the motor suddenly malfunctioned. Finally, I opted to purchase the top-of-the-line Craftsman saw, which interestingly enough is made by Bosch, and to my delight, I encountered none of the previous issues - it's truly remarkable.",21
"Despite the hefty price and renowned name of this saw, it fails to securely hold a blade. The first one I tried, as well as the replacement provided by Home Depot, proved to be inadequate. No matter what I did, the blade wouldn't stay in place. When I contacted the factory, they casually mentioned that they receive countless complaints about this specific problem. Predictably, during my last attempt, the motor suddenly stopped working. Eventually, I decided to invest in the high-end Craftsman saw, which surprisingly is manufactured by Bosch, and I must say, it performs flawlessly.",21
"This saw, despite its significant price and prestigious brand, proves incapable of securely holding a blade. Both the initial saw and the replacement I received from Home Depot had the same issue. Regardless of my efforts, I couldn't find a way to keep a blade in position. When I reached out to the factory, they casually mentioned receiving numerous complaints about this issue. Unsurprisingly, during my ultimate attempt, the motor abruptly stopped functioning. In the end, I finally decided to purchase the top-of-the-line Craftsman saw, which intriguingly enough is actually made by Bosch, and to my pleasant surprise, I encountered no issues - it's truly fantastic.",21
"At the age of 6, my daughter started playing this game, and now she's willing to play with anyone who offers!",22
"This game caught my daughter's interest when she was 6 years old, and now she's eager to play it with anyone who asks!",22
"Not only is it challenging and fun for adults, but my daughter started playing this game at age 6 and now she's game to play with anyone who offers!",22
"One of the advantages of this game is that it provides entertainment for both adults and children. However, you do need a fairly large, flat surface to create the tile patterns and be prepared for at least 30 minutes of gameplay to complete a full game.",22
"If you accidentally bump the table and disrupt the tile patterns, chaos can ensue, especially if the game is well underway. Nevertheless, I highly recommend it, even for adults.",22
"This game has captivated my daughter since she was 6 years old, and now she's willing to play it with anyone who extends an invitation! Although it requires a relatively large, flat surface to set up the tile patterns and a time commitment of at least 30 minutes to finish a game, the overall experience is challenging and fun, making it highly recommended, even for adults.",22
"Although we have played multiple sessions of Fluxx, we found it to be relatively unexciting despite its ease of learning and playing.",22
"The concept of constantly changing goals in Fluxx is interesting, but it changes so frequently that it leaves little room for strategic planning.",22
"Ultimately, the game boils down to holding onto cards in order to prevent another player from winning, only to be forced to play them later in the game. ",22
"Fortunately, the game did not cost much, which brings a sense of relief.",22
"As a novice to Fluxx-style games, I suspect they all share a similar nature and gameplay.",22
"Fluxx has been enjoyable to some extent, with its simplistic rules and mechanics, but it lacks the excitement that one would expect from a game of this nature.",22
"The game's poor quality makes it incredibly boring, as all you do is walk around and throw objects at things. Additionally, all the enemies look exactly the same and there is never any health available. Even with 100 health points, it's inadequate as the health depletes too quickly. Moreover, the limited sight range is absurd, with half the screen covered in fog that only clears up as you progress, making it difficult to spot enemies. Despite the enjoyable aspect of seeing familiar South Park characters in 3D and the game's humor, the ludicrous gameplay and lack of longevity discourage me from making a purchase. Renting it would be the most I'd consider.",23
"This game is incredibly poorly made, resulting in a tedious experience where your only actions involve walking around and throwing objects. All the enemies share the same appearance, there's a constant absence of health, and the provided 100 health points prove inadequate due to the rapid depletion. The sight range is laughable, with half the screen consumed by fog that only clears as you advance, posing a challenge in spotting enemies. While it's amusing to witness the familiar South Park characters in a 3D setting and the weapons bring humor to the game, it falls short of being worth a purchase. Renting it would be the more reasonable choice.",23
"With its poor construction, this game fails to deliver an engaging experience, making it incredibly dull as you're limited to walking around and throwing objects. The repetitive enemies, absence of health options, and the insufficient 100 health points add to the disappointment, given how rapidly the health depletes. Moreover, the ridiculous sight range, featuring a fog-covered half screen that gradually recedes as you progress, hampers enemy visibility. While the presence of familiar South Park characters in 3D and the comical weapons enhance the amusement factor, I wouldn't consider buying it. Renting, at most, seems more reasonable.",23
"The game's extremely low quality renders it exceptionally boring, as the gameplay solely revolves around walking and throwing projectiles. All enemies share an identical appearance, there are no health replenishments, and the given 100 health points prove insufficient due to their rapid decrease. The sight range is absurd, with half the screen blanketed in fog that gradually dissipates as you move forward, making enemy detection quite challenging. Though the presence of familiar South Park characters in 3D and the hilarity brought by the weapons are enjoyable, I wouldn't go as far as purchasing it. Renting, at most, seems like a more sensible choice.",23
"This game's poor craftsmanship results in an incredibly dull experience, limited to aimless walking and throwing objects. The monotonous enemies, absence of health resources, and inadequate 100 health points, which diminish at an alarming rate, contribute to the dissatisfaction. Furthermore, the sight range is preposterous, with half the screen engulfed in an obstructive fog that only clears as you progress, hindering enemy visibility. While the sight of familiar South Park characters in glorious 3D and the humor infused in the weapons provide entertainment, it fails to justify a purchase. Renting, at the most, seems like a more practical option.",23
"The game's extremely poor quality greatly detracts from its appeal, leading to a monotonous experience focused solely on mindless walking and throwing objects. Every enemy encountered boasts an identical design, and the absence of any health-restoration options, alongside the inadequacy of the given 100 health points due to rapid depletion, adds to the frustrations. The absurd sight range, where half the screen remains obscured by a thick fog that gradually dissipates as you move forward, poses visibility challenges in spotting enemies. Despite the amusement derived from witnessing familiar South Park characters in 3D and the comedic nature of the weapons, I wouldn't deem it worthy of purchase. Opting to rent it, at most, appears to be a more sensible choice.",23
"When I first acquired this game, ages ago, it was absolutely astonishing.",23
"It's quite amusing how they were discussing the development of Diablo 2 back then, while it took me another two and a half years to finally lay eyes on it.",23
"If you're using a computer older than dirt, feel free to purchase this game. In my opinion, it's fantastic despite being outdated.",23
"Interestingly enough, I believe I witnessed someone playing this game during my recent visit to Amish country.",23
"This game, obtained a million years ago or so, was truly remarkable upon initial experience.",23
"Little did I know that it would take at least two and a half years before I had the chance to play Diablo 2, a game they had already been discussing during that time. Remarkably, I spotted someone playing it during my last visit to Amish country.",23
