"The bulldog gets it done.  I can't say enough about this tool.  Its done everything I've asked it to do. From hammering through a 8 in slab, to drilling through  8 in block.Of course, I don't use it everyday like a contractor, but I'de imagine for that kind of use, I'de buy one of the bigger bosch hammers for everyday punishment.  The bits are somewhat pricey, but for good reason, they last!  You will only probably need to buy them once.For occasional to medium use,  this is a winner!",21
"Despite the hefty price tag and prestigious name, this saw won't hold a blade! My first one wouldn't... and neither would the replacement Home Depot gave me. Nothing I did would make a blade stay in. Call to the factory elicited this comment: &quot;Yeah, we get a lot of complaints about that.&quot;  Duh! Tried it one last time and -- the motor went out!  I finallly bought the top-of-the-line Craftsman (made by Bosch) and no such problems -- it's a honey.",21
"My daughter began playing this game at age 6.  She will now play it with anyone who offers!  It is challenging and fun for adults as well.  The only downsides are that you need a fairly large, flat surface to create the tile patterns, and you need to be prepared to play for 30 minutes or more in order to finish a full game.  If you bump the table and jar the tiles, it can really lead to chaos if the game is fairly far-along.  Overall, however, I highly recommend it, even for adults.",22
"We've played a few games of Fluxx and while it is easy to learn and play, it just isn't a very exciting game. The idea that the goal continually changes is neat, but it continually changes so often you really have no way to strategize. It ends up coming down to holding cards in your hand that you can't play so another player won't win, until you have to play something to end the game. Thankfully it wasn't very expensive. This is my first Fluxx style game but I assume all of them are very similar in nature.",22
"This game was very poorly made...it's really boring, because all you do is walk around and throw stuff at things. All the enemies are exactly the same, there's never any health, and 100 health points aren't enough, because the health goes down too fast. The sight of range is ridiculous because half the screen is nothing but fog, and it all just draws in as you walk ahead, making it hard to see enemies. I do like seeing the familiar South Park characters in 3D, the game is very funny, and the weapons are hilarious! But still, I wouldn't buy it. Rent at most.",23
"This was an amazing game when I first got it... a million years ago or so.  Funny thing is, they were talking about Diablo 2 in developement back then, but I didn't see it for at least another 2 and a half years...If you happen to be running a computer that is older than dirt, go ahead and buy this game, I think it is great, but it is way past it's time.  As a matter of fact, I think I saw someone playing it the last time I was in Amish country.",23
"The bulldog efficiently accomplishes its tasks. I cannot speak highly enough of this tool. It has successfully performed every job I've assigned it, be it breaking an 8-inch slab or drilling through 8-inch blocks. Although I don't use it as much as contractors do, I would consider purchasing one of the bigger Bosch hammers for more regular use. The drill bits can be a bit pricey, but they are durable enough to last a long time. You probably won't need to buy them more than once. For occasional to moderate use, this tool is a winner!",21
"The bulldog is a powerhouse that always gets the job done. I can't stress enough how impressed I am with this tool. It has tackled every task I've given it, from breaking through 8-inch slabs to drilling into 8-inch blocks. I don't use it as often as a contractor would, but I can imagine that for heavy everyday use, investing in one of the larger Bosch hammers would be a smart choice. The drill bits may be a bit costly, but their durability justifies the price. You'll probably only need to buy them once. For occasional to moderate usage, this tool is a definite winner!",21

It has satisfactorily completed every assignment I have given it, whether it involves breaking through an 8-inch slab or drilling into 8-inch blocks.

"The bulldog is an exceptionally capable tool. I cannot praise it enough. It has effortlessly handled every task I've thrown at it, including breaking through 8-inch slabs and drilling into 8-inch blocks. While I don't use it as extensively as a contractor would, I imagine that for consistent usage, opting for one of the larger Bosch hammers would be more suitable. The drill bits can be a bit pricey, but their longevity justifies the cost. You will probably only need to buy them once. For occasional to moderate usage, this tool is a winner!",21
"The bulldog is a formidable performer. I cannot overstate its excellence. It has successfully completed every assignment I've given it, from smashing through 8-inch slabs to drilling into 8-inch blocks. Although I don't employ it as frequently as a professional contractor would, I imagine that for heavy-duty use, a larger Bosch hammer would be a better investment. The drill bits may be a bit expensive, but their durability justifies the price. You will likely only need to purchase them once. For sporadic to moderate usage, this tool is a clear winner!",21

"In spite of its expensive cost and reputable brand, this particular saw fails to secure a blade. The initial one I purchased as well as the replacement from Home Depot suffered from the same issue. Despite my various attempts, I couldn't keep a blade in place. Upon contacting the factory, I was informed that they receive numerous complaints about this matter. Frustratingly, the motor stopped working after one final try! Thankfully, I eventually invested in the high-end Craftsman saw (manufactured by Bosch), and it has been problem-free; it's truly outstanding.",21
"Despite its high price and prestigious reputation, this saw is incapable of holding a blade. Neither the initial one I bought nor the replacement from Home Depot could keep a blade in place, regardless of my efforts. The factory acknowledged the commonness of this complaint.

Finally, I decided to purchase the top-of-the-line Craftsman saw, which is made by Bosch, and it has proven to be reliable without any such issues.",21
"Despite being expensive and well-known, this saw is unable to retain a blade. Both the first one I purchased and the replacement from Home Depot suffered from this issue, despite my attempts to fix it.

Eventually, I opted for the high-end Craftsman saw, which is a Bosch product, and it has performed flawlessly without any similar problems.",21
"Regardless of its hefty price tag and prestigious brand, this saw lacks the ability to hold a blade securely. The original one I bought and the replacement provided by Home Depot both had the same problem, and my attempts to rectify it were unsuccessful. The factory's response to my complaint was unsurprising: ""We receive a lot of similar complaints."" In an added stroke of bad luck, the saw's motor malfunctioned. Finally, I decided to invest in the top-of-the-line Craftsman saw, manufactured by Bosch, and I have since encountered no such issues; it is truly exceptional.",21
"In spite of its expensive cost and prestigious reputation, this saw fails to keep a blade in place. This was the case with both the first saw I purchased and the replacement I received from Home Depot, regardless of my efforts to solve the problem. When I contacted the factory, they simply acknowledged the high number of complaints they receive about this issue. Adding to the frustration, the motor eventually stopped functioning. Eventually, I made the decision to buy the premium Craftsman saw, which is made by Bosch, and it has proved to be absolutely problem-free.",21
"Despite its considerable price and renowned brand, this saw is ineffective at retaining a blade securely. This was evident in both my initial purchase and the replacement from Home Depot, despite my attempts to address the issue. The factory confirmed that they frequently receive similar complaints. Adding to the disappointment, the motor eventually gave out. Fortunately, I ultimately splurged on the top-of-the-line Bosch-manufactured Craftsman saw, and it has exceeded my expectations without any of the previous problems.",21
"At the age of 6, my daughter started engaging in this game. She is now willing to play it with whoever offers. It provides a good challenge and entertainment even to adults. The only drawbacks are the requirement of a reasonably large and flat surface for arranging the tiles, as well as the need to dedicate at least 30 minutes to complete a full game. It's worth noting that accidentally jarring the tiles by bumping into the table can cause chaos, especially if the game is in progress. Nevertheless, I highly recommend it, even to grown-ups.",22
"Initially introduced to my daughter when she was 6, she has now grown fond of this game and readily plays it with anyone willing to join. The game offers an enjoyable and challenging experience not only for children but also for adults. The only downsides are the necessity of a spacious and level surface to construct the tile patterns and the requirement of dedicating a minimum of 30 minutes to complete an entire game. A word of caution: if the table gets bumped and the tiles are disturbed, it can lead to a chaotic situation, particularly when the game is well underway. Nevertheless, I wholeheartedly recommend it, even for adults.",22
"From the age of 6, my daughter has been actively engaged in playing this game and she is now open to playing it with anyone who expresses interest. It offers a stimulating and enjoyable experience for adults as well. The only disadvantages to consider are the need for a sufficiently large and flat surface to set up the tile patterns and the requirement of committing to a minimum of 30 minutes to successfully complete a full game. It's important to be cautious about inadvertently shaking the table and disrupting the tiles, as it can result in chaos, particularly during a more advanced stage of the game. Overall, I highly recommend it, even for mature players.",22

"We have played a few games of Fluxx and while it is easy to grasp and participate in, it lacks a certain thrill.",22
"Fluxx is not particularly thrilling, despite its ease of learning and playing. The constant altering of goals is a fascinating concept, yet its excessive frequency hinders the ability to strategize effectively.",22

"Our experience with Fluxx has revealed that, although it is easy to learn and play, it fails to enthuse. The regular modification of goals is a clever idea, but the incessant changes impede strategic thinking.",22
"Fluxx is not an overly captivating game, despite its simplicity in learning and playing. The notion of constantly shifting objectives is intriguing, yet the frequent alterations undermine the ability to strategize effectively.",22
"The creation of this game lacked attention to detail, resulting in a dull and unengaging experience. The gameplay primarily involves aimlessly traversing the environment and hurling objects at targets. The enemies lack variety, there is no provision for health replenishment, and the initial allotment of 100 health points proves inadequate due to rapid depletion. The limited sight range is ludicrous, as a significant portion of the screen remains veiled in a dense fog, only clearing as one progresses, impeding the clear view of adversaries. However, the charming three-dimensional portrayal of familiar South Park characters and the inclusion of amusing weapons do add some redeeming qualities. Nonetheless, I would not recommend purchasing this game, at best, consider renting it.",23
"This game suffers from a severe lack of quality in its development, resulting in a monotonous and uninspiring experience. The gameplay revolves around aimless wandering and mindlessly tossing objects at various targets. The enemies encountered are overwhelmingly similar, and there is no provision for health regeneration, making the initially allotted 100 health points inadequate as they deplete quickly. Additionally, the visual range is absurd, with a significant portion of the screen obscured by persistent fog that only dissipates as one progresses, hindering visibility of adversaries. Notwithstanding the enjoyable three-dimensional portrayal of beloved South Park characters and the inclusion of comical weapons, I cannot recommend purchasing this game; renting it, at most, may be a more reasonable choice.",23

The core gameplay revolves around aimless exploration and the mindless act of throwing objects at various targets. The enemies encountered lack diversity, health regeneration is absent, and the allocated 100 health points quickly prove insufficient, given their rapid depletion rate. The visual range is absurdly limited, with a significant portion of the screen perpetually obscured by an encompassing fog that dissipates progressively as the player moves forward, impeding the visibility of adversaries.

The gameplay primarily revolves around aimlessly roaming and indiscriminately hurling objects at various targets. The adversaries encountered lack variety, health regeneration is absent, and the initial allocation of 100 health points proves woefully insufficient as they deplete rapidly.

"This game was truly incredible when I first obtained it... probably ages ago. Interestingly, there were already talks about Diablo 2 being developed at that time, but I didn't get to experience it until two and a half years later. If you happen to have a computer as old as dirt, feel free to go ahead and get this game because I think it's fantastic, despite being way beyond its prime. Actually, I even saw someone playing it during my most recent visit to Amish country.",23
