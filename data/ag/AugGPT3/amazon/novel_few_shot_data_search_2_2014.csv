"I have this hooked to a Sears Shop Wet/Dry Vacuum.  As others have noted, the attachment size is a little ""non-standard"", probably due to the fact that the hose fits over the tools instead of sliding in them.  Nonetheless, the hose and swivel are easy to use and the material makes for very efficient pickup.  I also like the claw and crevice nozzle.  They are a bit small for small spaces in my small car, but they are great for going over floors, seats, and jobsite pickup.  Definitely recommended over the stock hose that comes with most shop & wet/dry vacs.",21
"Sturdy with an adjustable mouth and blade tilt.Understand you will need to prep this before use. The sole is not precision ground but machine rough, so you will need a granite block and sandpaper or a set of flat block diamond hones. Once you have your sole (and sides) honed and flat you will need to sharpen the blade. There are several jigs and sharpening tools to assist in this. After all is done apply an anti-rust agent such as wood wax or Boeshield.Once prep'd this is a great plane.",21
"I picked this game up at a store because it was on sale.  Got home and read reviews...almost returned it.  Glad I didn't because it actually works very well for my kids.  My daughter (4) and son (2 1/2) both love it and can always make a ""basket"" within about 4 tries.  My kids were actually better at it than my husband and myself!  Granted, we have to center the doggy for them so they're lined up to flip the ants, but I don't mind that.  Definitely wasn't too difficult for them.",22
I purchased this game to be used during a trip with my granddaughters ages 6 and 8.  They loved the game so much that one of them asked that I purchase another one just for them for their birthday.  It is a great tool to assist them in broadening their vocabulary and spelling skills while enjoying the competition of a game. It is easy to play and understand.  Melissa and Doug have designed a visibly appealing and durable product with all parts attached to the one board eliminating the chance of losing pieces.,22
"If you have not already noticed, Diablo is easily located within Dungeons and Dragons. This is actually a benefit for Diablo, since it has very little story going on. This RPG/action hybrid is nice and it's multiplayer community is huge. Too bad there are millions of cheaters. Just be legit and everyone else will catch on. The game offers lots of fun. Not many complaints though. They are really your choice as to if they're bad or good. Get the game if you want. Not a wasted ""money"".",23
"Dino Crisis is a great game -- lots of excitement, suspense, and action.  It doesn't fail there.  I beat it in four days (seven hours playing time), though, so definitely rent it first.Some of the voice acting is weak,  but it's not the worst out there.  The story will keep you interested, as  will the battles with the enemy dinosaurs.  An added plus is the decisions  you must make at key points in the story, but even this (and the different  costumes) isn't enough to give the game the replay value it needs to make  it a 5-star game.",23
"This Sears Shop Wet/Dry Vacuum is equipped with my current setup. As others have pointed out, the attachment's size is somewhat unusual, likely due to the design that allows the hose to fit over the tools instead of sliding into them. In any case, the hose and swivel mechanism are easily operated, and the material used ensures highly efficient collection of debris. I particularly appreciate the claw and crevice nozzle, which, although slightly small for confined spaces in my compact car, are ideal for cleaning floors, seats, and tidying up work areas. I highly recommend choosing this option over the standard hose that usually accompanies most shop and wet/dry vacuums.",21

"With a durable construction and the ability to adjust the mouth and blade tilt, it is important to prepare this tool before using it. The sole is not precisely ground, but rather has a rough machine finish, which means you'll need a granite block and sandpaper or a set of flat block diamond hones to make it smooth. Once you have properly honed and flattened the sole (as well as the sides), you will then need to sharpen the blade. There are various jigs and sharpening tools available to help with this process.
