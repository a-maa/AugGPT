"I'm really disappointed in this.  We got it for our son and after one adult driven test drive to see how the controls worked (with no major crashes...a few wall bumps and one ceiling touch, by far nothing hard enough to visibly damage it) and it would not lift off again after that.  No visible damage, no gears stripped, full charge...all it would do after the first 2 minute flight was spin on the ground.  It's repackaged and on it's way back to Amazon as I type.  Save your money.",22

"One of the first games released for the Dreamcast, House of the Dead 2 is an instant classic.  The game is identical to the arcade smash with the inclusion of exclusive Dreamcast levels, and the graphics and detailed zombies will leave your mouth watering.  The voice acting is pretty bad though, making the voice acting from the first Resident Evil look like Shakespearian acting, but that is overlooked by the shoot 'em up action.  A light gun is strongly recommended, but the standard DC controler works just as well, somewhat.",23
