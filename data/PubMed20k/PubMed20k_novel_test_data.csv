A post hoc analysis was conducted with the use of data from the Evaluation Study of Congestive Heart Failure and Pulmonary Artery Catheterization Effectiveness ( ESCAPE ) .,3
"Liver function tests ( LFTs ) were measured at 7 time points from baseline , at discharge , and up to 6 months follow-up .",3
"Survival analyses were used to assess the association between admission Model of End-Stage Liver Disease Excluding International Normalized Ratio ( MELD-XI ) scores and patient outcome.There was a high prevalence of abnormal baseline ( admission ) LFTs ( albumin 23.8 % , aspartate transaminase 23.5 % , alanine transaminase 23.8 % , and total bilirubin 36.1 % ) .",3
The percentage of patients with abnormal LFTs decreased significantly from baseline to 6-months ' follow-up .,3
"When mean hemodynamic profiles were compared in patients with abnormal versus normal LFTs , elevated total bilirubin was associated with a significantly lower cardiac index ( 1.80 vs 2.1 ; P < .001 ) and higher central venous pressure ( 14.2 vs 12.0 ; P = .03 ) .",3
"Multivariable analyses revealed that patients with elevated MELD-XI scores ( 16.8 ) had a 2-fold ( hazard ratio2 .06 , 95 % confidence interval 1.05-4 .03 ) increased risk of death , rehospitalization , or transplantation after adjusting for baseline LFTs , age , sex , race , body mass index , diabetes , and systolic blood pressure .",3
Abnormal LFTs are common in the ADHF population and are a dynamic marker of an impaired hemodynamic state .,4
Elevated MELD-XI scores are associated with poor outcomes among patients admitted with ADHF .,4
A total of 116 patients were randomized .,3
The 30-day mortality rate was 21 per cent after EVAR and 25 per cent for OR : absolute risk reduction ( ARR ) 44 ( 95 per cent confidence interval ( c.i. ) -110 to 197 ) per cent .,3
"At 6months , the total mortality rate for EVAR was 28 per cent , compared with 31 per cent among those assigned to OR : ARR 24 ( -142 to 190 ) per cent .",3
"The mean cost difference between EVAR and OR was 5306 ( 95 per cent c.i. -1854 to 12,659 ) at 30days and 10,189 ( -2477 to 24,506 ) at 6months .",3
"The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio per prevented death was 120,591 at 30days and 424,542 at 6months .",3
There was no significant difference in quality of life between EVAR and OR .,3
Nor was EVAR superior regarding cost-utility .,3
"EVAR may be more effective for rAAA , but its increased costs mean that it is unaffordable based on current standards of societal willingness-to-pay for health gains .",4
"In the baseline placebo condition , the HSA group showed greater attentional bias for emotional faces than healthy individuals .",3
Oxytocin reduced the difference between HSA and non-socially anxious individuals in attentional bias for emotional faces .,3
"Moreover , it appeared to normalize attentional bias in HSA individuals to levels seen in the healthy population in the baseline condition .",3
The biological mechanisms by which oxytocin may be exerting these effects are discussed .,3
"These results , coupled with previous research , could indicate a potential therapeutic use of this hormone in treatment for social anxiety .",4
Self-rated throat irritation was higher during diesel exhaust than filtered air exposure .,3
"Clinical signs of irritation in the upper airways were also significantly more common after diesel exhaust exposure ( odds ratio = 3.2 , p < 0.01 ) .",3
"PEF increased during filtered air , but decreased during diesel exhaust exposure , with a statistically significant difference at 75 min ( +4 L/min vs. -10 L/min , p = 0.005 ) .",3
"Monocyte and total leukocyte counts in peripheral blood were higher after exposure to diesel exhaust than filtered air 20 h post-exposure , and a trend ( p = 0.07 ) towards increased serum IL-6 concentrations was also observed 20 h post-exposure .",3
"Diesel exhaust induced acute adverse effects such as symptoms and signs of irritation , decreased PEF , inflammatory markers in healthy volunteers .",4
The effects were first seen at 75 min of exposure .,4
Baseline socio-demographic and assessment measures were similar in both groups .,3
"The study group had consistent improvement in terms of outcome measures with HDRS , GAF , and PGWBI scores showing respective mean change of -15.08 , 22 , and 60 over 12 weeks .",3
"The comparable respective changes in the controls were -8.77 , 18.1 , and 43.25 .",3
Structured psycho-education combined with pharmacotherapy is an effective intervention for people with depressive disorders .,4
"Psycho-education optimises the pharmacological treatment of depression in terms of faster recovery , reduction in severity of depression , and improvement in subjective wellbeing and social functioning .",4
"Mean leuprolide concentrations between weeks 4 and 12 for 11.25 and 30 mg doses were relatively constant and dose proportional , with no accumulation of leuprolide upon repeated administration .",3
Body weight and age were not found to be significant covariates on leuprolide pharmacokinetics .,3
Higher leuprolide concentrations were associated with higher probability of LH suppression and both doses provided LH suppression levels < 4 mIU/mL .,3
Leuprolide pharmacokinetics were characterized for 11.25 and 30 mg 3-month depot injections .,4
An exposure-response model was developed to link leuprolide concentrations and probability of peak-stimulated LH suppression .,4
"At study entry , rs1229984 GA polymorphism was associated with lower prevalence of regular use of alcohol and decreased consumption among regular users .",3
"Six years later , 502 men ( 14.2 % ) showed evidence of cognitive impairment .",3
"Abstainers and irregular drinkers had higher odds of cognitive impairment than regular drinkers ( odds ratio [ OR ] = 1.23 , 95 % confidence interval [ CI ] = 1.00-1 .51 , after adjustment for other measured factors ) .",3
"The rs1229984 GA polymorphism did not decrease the odds of cognitive impairment ( AA/GG OR = 1.35 , 95 % CI = 0.29-6 .27 ; GA/GG OR = 1.05 , 95 % CI = 0.71-1 .55 ) .",3
"Alcohol consumption , including heavy regular drinking and abuse , is not a direct cause of cognitive impairment in later life .",4
"Our results are consistent with the possibility , but do not prove , that regular moderate drinking decreases the risk of cognitive impairment in older men .",4
"CRAFT-T resulted in a moderate but non-significant effect on treatment retention ( p = 0.058 , hazard ratio = 0.57 ) .",3
"When the CSO was parental family , CRAFT-T had a large and significant effect on treatment retention ( p < 0.01 , hazard ratio = .040 ) .",3
CRAFT-T had a significant positive effect on IP opioid and other drug use ( p < 0.0001 ) .,3
CRAFT-T is a promising treatment for opioid use disorder but replication is needed to confirm these results .,4
"Multivariate analysis showed differences between diets when comparing Med + CoQ diet and saturated fat diet , with greater hippurate urine levels after Med + CoQ diet and higher phenylacetylglycine levels after saturated fat diet in women .",3
"Following consumption of Med + CoQ , hippurate excretion was positively correlated with CoQ and - carotene plasma levels and inversely related to Nrf2 , thioredoxin , superoxide dismutase 1 , and gp91 ( phox ) subunit of NADPH oxidase gene expression .",3
"After saturated fat diet consumption , phenylacetylglycine excretion was inversely related to CoQ plasma level and positively correlated with isoprostanes urinary level .",3
"The association between hippurate excretion and antioxidant biomarkers along with the relationship between phenylacetylglycine excretion and oxidant biomarkers suggests that the long-term consumption of a Med + CoQ diet could be beneficial for healthy aging and a promising challenge in the prevention of processes related to chronic oxidative stress , such as cardiovascular and neurodegenerative disease .",4
"After 3 sessions of treatment , GMFM score was increased apparently as compared with that before treatment in the two groups ( P < 0.01 , P < 0.05 ) .",3
"After treatment , GMFM score in the observation group was increased more remarkably than that in the control group ( 55.32 + / - 17.10 vs 47.48 + / - 17.18 , P < 0.05 ) .",3
"After treatment , the total effective rate of gastrocnemius Ashworth spasm grade [ 90.0 % ( 36/40 ) ] in the observation group was better apparently than [ 72.5 % ( 29/40 ) ] in the control group ( P < 0.05 ) .",3
The combined therapeutic program of Jin three-needle therapy and MOTOmet intelligent motor training improves the lower limb motor function of the children with spastic cerebral palsy and its efficacy is better than simple MOTOmed .,4
"1713 patients were assigned to stenting ( n = 855 ) or endarterectomy ( n = 858 ) and followed up for a median of 42 years ( IQR 30-52 , maximum 100 ) .",3
"Three patients withdrew immediately and , therefore , the ITT population comprised 1710 patients .",3
"The number of fatal or disabling strokes ( 52 vs 49 ) and cumulative 5-year risk did not differ significantly between the stenting and endarterectomy groups ( 64 % vs 65 % ; hazard ratio [ HR ] 106 , 95 % CI 072-157 , p = 077 ) .",3
"Any stroke was more frequent in the stenting group than in the endarterectomy group ( 119 vs 72 events ; ITT population , 5-year cumulative risk 152 % vs 94 % , HR 171 , 95 % CI 128-230 , p < 0001 ; per-protocol population , 5-year cumulative risk 89 % vs 58 % , 153 , 102-231 , p = 004 ) , but were mainly non-disabling strokes .",3
"The distribution of modified Rankin scale scores at 1 year , 5 years , or final follow-up did not differ significantly between treatment groups .",3
Long-term functional outcome and risk of fatal or disabling stroke are similar for stenting and endarterectomy for symptomatic carotid stenosis .,4
"Compared with group S , the arterial lactate value in T4 ( after operation began 80 min ) were significantly decreased in group P ( P = 0.013 ) , and venous lactate value in T5 ( after operation began 100 min ) were also lower ( P = 0.044 ) , other lactate value were not different ( P > 0.05 ) .",3
The anal exhaust time was not different between the two groups ( P = 0.673 ) .,3
"All the patients were survival , and there were no obvious postoperative complications .",3
"Compared to group S , there was a transient improvement in tissue perfusion in group P , but there were no difference in complications and mortality .",4
"In both study groups , the pain Visual Analogue Scale and Functional Index for Hand Osteoarthritis scores decreased significantly during follow-up compared to baseline .",3
There were no significant differences between the groups .,3
"However , at 90 days , the functional score showed a trend towards greater clinical improvement in the hyaluronic acid group ( P 0.071 ) .",3
A subanalysis of patients with Functional Index score5 and Visual Analogue Scale score3 at baseline showed a significantly higher median functionality score in the hyaluronic acid group ( P 0.005 at 90 days and P 0.020 at 180 days ) .,3
"Further limiting analysis to a baseline pain score5 showed significantly greater improvement in functionality score ( P 0.004 at 180 days ) , which was already apparent after the second intra-articular injection at 14 days ( P 0.028 ) .",3
"In this patient subset , the mean pain score also improved significantly at 180 days ( P 0.02 ) .",3
Both hyaluronic acid and betamethasone were effective and well-tolerated for the management of rhizarthrosis .,4
Hyaluronic acid was more effective over time and more efficiently improved functionality and pain in patients with more severe symptoms .,4
"Among subjects with 25OHD status of 20 ng/mL or greater , the 97.5 th percentile of plasma PTH concentration was 45.5 ng/L .",3
"By using this value as a reference , 5 % of the subjects with plasma 25OHD less than 20 nmol/L had a high plasma PTH level , reflecting secondary hyperparathyroidism .",3
"Among vitamin D-replete subjects ( 25OHD status of 20 ng/mL or greater ) , the 97.5 th percentile of plasma PTH was higher in overweight/obese subjects ( 51.9 vs 43.5 ng/L among normal weight subjects ) .",3
The reference value for plasma PTH defined in this vitamin D-replete population was far below the value currently provided by the manufacturer ( 65 ng/L ) and varied according to overweight status .,4
These results may contribute to improve the diagnosis of primary and secondary hyperparathyroidism and subsequent therapeutic indication .,4
A total of 32 of 39 SLIT and 16 of 21 placebo patients completed the study .,3
There was significant clinical improvement in both the SLIT and placebo groups .,3
Median T5SS decreased from 14.75 to 5.25 in the SLIT group ( P < .001 ) and 12.7 to 6.0 in the placebo group ( P = .003 ) .,3
The median quality-of-life score also decreased in the SLIT group ( P < .001 ) and the placebo group ( P < .001 ) .,3
A subgroup analysis of patients found a 60 % or greater improvement ( on the T5SS and the Juniper Rhinitis Quality of Life Questionnaire ) in the good responders group and a 30 % to 59 % improvement or no improvement in the intermediate responders group .,3
This subgroup analysis also found more good responders in the SLIT group ( 47 % ) compared with the placebo group ( 25 % ; P = .07 ) .,3
"Significant decreases in the IL-5 / IFN - ( P < .001 ) , IL-13 / IFN - ( P < .001 ) , and IL-4 / IFN - ( P = .03 ) ratios were found in the combined good clinical improvement group at 24 months .",3
"A good clinical response ( 60 % improvement in both TSS5 and quality of life ) is associated with significant decreases in IL-5 , IL-13 , and IL-4 relative to IFN - during 2 years of SLIT therapy for HDMs .",4
Statistically and clinically significant improvements in bowel function were observed following double-blind treatment with OXN PR .,3
Mean ( SD ) reduction in BFI score was 21.2 ( 28.8 ) and comparable in patients with cancer-related ( 19.0 [ 28.9 ] ) and non-cancer pain ( 23.3 .,3
[ 29.0 ] ; P0 .0002 ) .,3
"Furthermore , the proportion of patients with a BFI score within normal range ( 28.8 ) increased from 9.5 % at screening to 43.1 % at Day 15 of OXN PR .",3
"While all patients used 2 laxatives of different classes at screening , during study treatment 36 % stopped using laxatives ( P < 0.001 ) .",3
"OXN PR provided effective analgesia , evidenced by stable pain scores during study treatment , and there were no unanticipated adverse events .",3
"OXN PR significantly improved bowel function and reduced the use of laxatives in patients with OIC , previously unresponsive to at least two different classes of laxatives .",4
OXN also provided effective analgesia for patients with moderate-to-severe cancer-related pain and non-cancer-related pain .,4
"In the electroacupuncture group , the palpebral fissure size was ( 9.79 + / -2.65 ) mm and the eyeball shifting distance was ( 18.12 + / -1.30 ) mm , which were hig-her than ( 8.23 + / -2.74 ) mm and ( 16.71 + / -1.44 ) mm respectively in the acupuncture group .",3
"In the electroacupuncture group , the pupil diameter was ( 0.44 + / -0.42 ) mm , which was less than ( 0.72 + / - 0.53 ) mm in the acupuncture group , indicating the significant difference ( all P < 0.05 ) .",3
"The cured rate was 63.33 % ( 19/30 ) and the total effective rate was 93.33 % ( 28/30 ) in the electroacupuncture group , which was better than 36.67 % ( 11/30 ) and 83.333 ( 25/30 ) in the acupuncture group separately , indicating the significant difference ( all P < 0.05 ) .",3
"Electroacupuncture presents the obvious advantages in the treatment of oculomotor impairment , characterized as quick and high effect , short duration of treatment and remarkable improvements in clinical symptoms , there are important significance for the improvement of survival quality of patients .",4
"The study included a total of 2,579 children .",3
"Adjusting for socio-economic status , the mean WLZ at 24weeks were in Burkina Faso -0.20 ( 95 % CI -0.39 to -0.01 ) and in Uganda -0.23 ( 95 % CI -0.43 to -0.03 ) lower in the intervention than in the control arm .",3
In South Africa the mean WLZ at 24weeks was 0.23 ( 95 % CI 0.03 to 0.43 ) greater in the intervention than in the control arm .,3
Differences in LAZ between the study arms were small and not statistically significant .,3
"In Uganda , infants in the intervention arm were more likely to be wasted compared to those in the control arm at 24weeks ( PR 2.36 ; 95 % CI 1.11 to 5.00 ) .",3
Differences in wasting in South Africa and Burkina Faso and stunting and underweight in all three countries were small and not significantly different .,3
"There were small differences in mean anthropometric indicators between the intervention and control arms in the study , but in Uganda and Burkina Faso , a tendency to slightly lower ponderal growth ( weight-for-length z-scores ) was found in the intervention arms .",4
"Relative to the placebo , 1-wk intake of nitrate-rich beetroot juice resulted in a 3-fold increase in plasma nitrite and nitrate , a 7-fold increase in salivary nitrite , an 8-fold higher salivary nitrate , and a 4-fold increase in both urinary nitrite and nitrate ( P < 0.001 ) .",3
"However , no differences in home blood pressure and 24-h ambulatory blood pressure were observed with 1-wk intake of nitrate-rich beetroot juice in comparison with the placebo .",3
An increase in dietary nitrate intake may not be an effective short-term approach to further lower blood pressure in treated hypertensive subjects .,4
"The endurance time was significantly higher when patients cycled while using the Oxymizer in comparison to while using the CNC [ 858 754 vs. 766 652 s ; between-group difference 92 s ( 95 % confidence interval 32-152 ) , p < 0.001 ] .",3
"In addition to a longer cycling duration , O2 saturation at isotime was significantly higher with the Oxymizer ( 93.5 5.4 vs. 90.4 5.3 % ; p = 0.027 ) .",3
"Furthermore , there was a positive correlation ( r = 0.427 , p = 0.002 ) between the O2 flow rate and improvements in the constant work rate test , showing greater improvements in favor of the Oxymizer in patients with a higher demand for O2 ( 4 liters/min ) .",3
We show that O2 delivery via the Oxymizer is superior to a CNC with regard to endurance capacity and oxygenation during exercise in patients with severe COPD .,4
"It seems that patients with a higher demand for O2 ( 4 liters/min ) , in particular , may benefit more from the use of the Oxymizer .",4
"Plasma antipsychotic concentrations were available for 16 and 15 patients in the reduction and maintenance groups , respectively .",3
Estimated dopamine D occupancy ( mean SD ) decreased following dose reduction from 75.6 % 4.9 % to 66.8 % 6.4 % at peak and 72.3 % 5.7 % to 62.0 % 6.8 % at trough .,3
"In the reduction group , 10 patients ( 62.5 % ) did not demonstrate continuous D receptor blockade above 65 % ( ie , < 65 % at trough ) after dose reduction ; furthermore , 7 patients ( 43.8 % ) did not achieve a threshold of 65 % occupancy even at peak .",3
"Nonetheless , only 1 patient met our relapse criteria after dose reduction during the 6 months of the study .",3
The results suggest that the therapeutic threshold regarding dopamine D occupancy may be lower for those who are stable in antipsychotic maintenance versus acute-phase treatment .,4
Positron emission tomography studies are warranted to further test our preliminary findings .,4
Seven of 69 eyes ( 10.1 % ) at 56 weeks and 64 of 368 eyes ( 17.4 % ) at week 104 had ORTs .,3
"Absence of diabetes , poor VA , blocked fluorescence , geographic atrophy , greater lesion size , and presence of subretinal hyperreflective material at baseline were associated independently with greater risk of ORT at 104 weeks ( P < 0.05 ) .",3
Neither drug nor dosing regimen were associated significantly with ORT .,3
The mean VA of eyes with ORT at week 104 ( 58.5 Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study letters ) was worse than the mean VA of eyes without ORT ( 68.8 letters ; P < 0.0001 ) .,3
"At 2 years after initiation of anti-VEGF therapy for neovascular AMD , ORTs are present in a substantial proportion of eyes .",4
We identified baseline features that independently predict ORTs .,4
It is important to identify ORTs because eyes with ORTs have worse VA outcomes than those without this finding .,4
Recruitment occurred between February 2013 and February 2014 .,3
A total of 124 patients were randomised .,3
Study completion is anticipated in August 2014 .,3
"It is expected that the results of this study will establish whether adding liraglutide to patients with type 2 diabetes treated with MDI will improve glycaemic control , lower body weight , and influence glycaemic variability .",4
"Of 805 patients enrolled , 401 received the NtRTI-sparing regimen and 404 the standard regimen , with median follow-up of 123 weeks ( IQR 112-133 ) .",3
Treatment failure was seen in 77 ( 19 % ) in the NtRTI-sparing group and 61 ( 15 % ) in the standard group .,3
"Kaplan-Meier estimated proportions of treatment failure by week 96 were 178 % and 138 % , respectively ( difference 40 % , 95 % CI -08 to 88 ) .",3
"The frequency of serious or treatment-modifying adverse events were similar ( 102 vs 83 per 100 person-years and 39 vs 42 per 100 person-years , respectively ) .",3
Our NtRTI-sparing regimen was non-inferior to standard treatment and represents a treatment option for patients with CD4 cell counts higher than 200 cells per L.,4
"An observational cohort study was conducted on acute myocardial infarction patients hospitalized in Ontario , Canada .",3
Projected life expectancy was estimated using actual survival data with extrapolation using proportional hazard models adjusting for important covariates .,3
The relationship between projected life expectancy with statins and reperfusion therapy was examined using generalized linear models .,3
"Among the 7001 acute myocardial infarction patients , 84.3 % were prescribed statins and 72.9 % were treated with reperfusion therapy .",3
"When projected life expectancy was < 10 years , the likelihood of receiving either treatment declined progressively with reduction in life expectancy ( P < 0.001 ) .",3
"At the 25th percentile of projected life expectancies , the likelihood of receiving a statin decreased by 1.4 % ( 95 % confidence interval , 1.0-1 .8 % ) , and acute reperfusion therapy decreased by 2.6 % ( 95 % confidence interval , 1.8-3 .3 % ) for each year decline in projected life expectancy .",3
Life expectancy of a patient strongly influences evidence-based treatment in acute myocardial infarction .,4
It was seen not only among patients with limited life expectancies but also among those with many years to live .,4
Treatment care gaps may reflect clinicians ' synthesis about frailty and life-expectancy gains .,4
"At 0.5 hours postdose , plasma concentrations of ticagrelor and AR-C124910XX were higher with crushed tablets administered orally ( 148.6 ng/mL and 13.0 ng/mL , respectively ) or via nasogastric tube ( 264.6 ng/mL and 28.6 ng/mL , respectively ) compared with whole-tablet administration ( 33.3 ng/mL and 5.2 ng/mL , respectively ) .",3
A similar trend was observed at 1 hour postdose .,3
"Ticagrelor tmax was shorter following crushed vs. whole-tablet administration ( 1 vs. 2 hours , respectively ) .",3
Geometric mean ratios between treatments for AUC and Cmax were contained within the bioequivalence limits of 80-125 % for ticagrelor and AR-C124910XX .,3
All treatments were generally well tolerated .,3
"Ticagrelor administered as a crushed tablet is bioequivalent to whole-tablet administration , independent of mode of administration ( oral or via nasogastric tube ) , and resulted in increased plasma concentrations of ticagrelor and ARC124910XX at early timepoints .",4
"Among 32126 livebirths , 22.3 % were preterm ( delivered at < 37 weeks gestation ) and almost half ( 46.4 % ) of all neonatal deaths occurred among preterm babies .",3
"Preterm babies who were born as the first child { [ risk ratio ( RR ) 1.4 ; 95 % confidence interval ( CI ) 1.1 , 1.8 ] } and in the poorest households [ RR 1.7 ; 95 % CI 1.2 , 2.4 ] were at higher mortality risk .",3
"Birth and newborn care preparedness was associated with lower risk of mortality [ RR 0.3 ; 95 % CI 0.2 , 0.4 ] while preterm infants who had symptoms of infection [ RR 5.6 ; 95 % CI 4.3 , 7.1 ] or whose mother suffered antenatal complications [ RR 1.4 ; 95 % CI 1.1 , 1.8 ] were at higher mortality risk .",3
"Elimination of excess neonatal deaths caused by preterm would decrease population-level neonatal mortality rate by 31.0 % [ 95 % CI 27.60 % , 34.5 % ] .",3
"Given that 87 % of preterm births and 60 % of preterm deaths were in late or moderate preterm infants , and that 87 % preterm babies received a visit from CHW within third day of life , a home-based essential care package delivered by CHWs for sick preterm infants , specifically focused on birth preparedness , skin-to-skin care , immediate breast feeding , early recognition of danger signs , and linked through referral to intensive and quality care in health facilities , could be an effective approach in low resource settings .",4
"At the preplanned interim overall survival analysis , which was performed after 77 % of the total number of expected events occurred , the overall survival rate at 12 months was 72 % ( 95 % confidence interval [ CI ] , 67 to 77 ) in the combination-therapy group and 65 % ( 95 % CI , 59 to 70 ) in the vemurafenib group ( hazard ratio for death in the combination-therapy group , 0.69 ; 95 % CI , 0.53 to 0.89 ; P = 0.005 ) .",3
"The prespecified interim stopping boundary was crossed , and the study was stopped for efficacy in July 2014 .",3
"Median progression-free survival was 11.4 months in the combination-therapy group and 7.3 months in the vemurafenib group ( hazard ratio , 0.56 ; 95 % CI , 0.46 to 0.69 ; P < 0.001 ) .",3
The objective response rate was 64 % in the combination-therapy group and 51 % in the vemurafenib group ( P < 0.001 ) .,3
Rates of severe adverse events and study-drug discontinuations were similar in the two groups .,3
Cutaneous squamous-cell carcinoma and keratoacanthoma occurred in 1 % of patients in the combination-therapy group and 18 % of those in the vemurafenib group .,3
"Dabrafenib plus trametinib , as compared with vemurafenib monotherapy , significantly improved overall survival in previously untreated patients with metastatic melanoma with BRAF V600E or V600K mutations , without increased overall toxicity .",4
"( Funded by GlaxoSmithKline ; ClinicalTrials.gov number , NCT01597908 . )",4
A total of 497 patients were randomized ; 74 % completed the study .,3
"The least squares mean difference ( LSMD ) for change from baseline to week 3 in YMRS total score was statistically significant in favor of both cariprazine groups versus placebo ( LSMD [ 95 % CI ] : 3-6 mg/d , -6.1 [ -8.4 to -3.8 ] ; 6-12 mg/d , -5.9 [ -8.2 , -3.6 ] ; P < .001 [ both ] ) .",3
"Both cariprazine treatment groups showed statistically significant superiority to placebo on all 11 YMRS single items ( all comparisons , P < .05 ) .",3
"Change from baseline in CGI-S scores was statistically significantly greater in both cariprazine groups compared with placebo ( LSMD [ 95 % CI ] : 3-6 mg/d , -0.6 [ -0.9 to -0.4 ] ; 6-12 mg/d , -0.6 [ -0.9 to -0.3 ] ; P < .001 [ both ] ) .",3
"The most common ( 5 % and twice the rate of placebo ) treatment-related adverse events for cariprazine were akathisia ( both groups ) and nausea , constipation , and tremor ( 6-12 mg/d only ) .",3
Results of this study demonstrated that both low - and high-dose cariprazine were more effective than placebo in the treatment of acute manic or mixed episodes associated with bipolar I disorder .,4
"Cariprazine was generally well tolerated , although the incidence of akathisia was greater with cariprazine than with placebo .",4
A hundred and nineteen women were enrolled into the study .,3
Fifty seven ( 48 % ) were randomized to Arm A and 62 ( 52 % ) to Arm B. Most of the women ( 90 % ) had ductal carcinoma and 10 % had lobular carcinoma .,3
"Of these , 26 ( 22 % ) achieved a pathological complete response ( pCR ) after NAC .",3
"There was no correlation between baseline ALDH1 expression and tumor grade , stage , hormone receptor , human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 ( HER2 ) status and Ki67 index .",3
ALDH1 negativity at baseline was significantly associated with pCR ( P = 0.004 ) .,3
The presence of ALDH1 ( + ) cells in the residual tumor cells in non-responding women was strongly predictive of worse overall survival ( P = 0.024 ) .,3
"Moreover , serial analysis of specimens from non-responders showed a marked increase in tumor-specific ALDH1 expression ( P = 0.028 ) .",3
"Overall , there was no survival difference according to the chemotherapy sequence .",3
"However , poorly responding tumours from women receiving docetaxel chemotherapy showed an unexpected significant increase in ALDH1 expression .",3
ALDH1 expression is a useful predictor of chemoresistance .,4
The up-regulation of ALDH1 after NAC predicts poor survival in locally advanced breast cancer .,4
"Although the chemotherapy sequence had no effect on overall prognosis , our results suggest that anthracycline-based chemotherapy may be more effective at targeting ALDH1 ( + ) breast cancer cells .",4
"Of the 2016 Chinese patients , 1104 ( 54.8 % ) were female .",3
"Six hundred eighteen ( 30.7 % ) had paroxysmal AF , 452 ( 22.4 % ) had persistent AF and 945 ( 46.9 % ) had permanent AF .",3
"The most common comorbidity was hypertension ( 55.5 % ) , followed by coronary artery disease ( 41.8 % ) and heart failure ( HF , 37.4 % ) .",3
"The prevalence of concomitant cardiovascular risk factors , such as HF and valvular heart disease , increased as AF progressed .",3
"Among the patients with non-valvular AF , 110 ( 12.7 % ) of those with CHADS2 ( congestive HF , hypertension , age of 75 years and greater , diabetes mellitus and history of stroke ) 2 were prescribed oral anticoagulants ( OAC ) , while 119 ( 15.6 % ) of those with CHADS2 < 2 received such agents .",3
"Among the 324 patients with valvular AF , 134 ( 41.4 % ) actually were treated with OAC .",3
The international normalised ratio value was within the target range ( 2.0-3 .0 ) in 96 patients only ( 26.4 % ) .,3
"Moreover , a total of 16.2 % of the patients received 1 anti-arrhythmic agents , whereas rate control agents were used more frequently ( 68.4 % ) .",3
"According to the present study , the risk profile and management of Chinese patients with AF/AFL differed from that observed in previous studies .",4
The use of OAC inadequately deviate from current guidelines .,4
"RFS remained superior in the imatinib arm ( hazard ratio , 0.6 ; 95 % CI , 0.43 to 0.75 ; Cox model-adjusted P < .001 ) .",3
"On multivariable analysis of patients in the placebo arm , large tumor size , small bowel location , and high mitotic rate were associated with lower RFS , whereas tumor genotype was not significantly associated with RFS .",3
Multivariable analysis of patients in the imatinib arm yielded similar findings .,3
"When comparing the two arms , imatinib therapy was associated with higher RFS in patients with a KIT exon 11 deletion of any type , but not a KIT exon 11 insertion or point mutation , KIT exon 9 mutation , PDGFRA mutation , or wild-type tumor , although some of these patient groups were small .",3
Adjuvant imatinib did not seem to alter overall survival .,3
"Our findings show that tumor size , location , and mitotic rate , but not tumor genotype , are associated with the natural history of GIST .",4
Patients with KIT exon 11 deletions assigned to 1 year of adjuvant imatinib had a longer RFS .,4
A total of 54 patients were included in the study .,3
Their ages ranged from 5 to 12 years with mean age 7.85 + / - 2.18 years .,3
"No statistically significant difference ( p > 0.05 ) was noted between the two groups for the patients experiencing vomiting ( 33 % vs 41 % , p = 0.389 ) , the mean number of episodes of vomiting ( 0.71 vs 0.88 , p = 0.555 ) , and patients requiring rescue anti-emetics ( 11 % vs 15 % , p = 0.500 ) .",3
Gastric aspiration during tonsillectomy is not useful in reducing post-tonsillectomy vomiting .,4
A total of 72 patients completed the study and 74 intention-to-treat patients were assessed .,3
"ATL1102 significantly reduced the cumulative number of new active lesions by 54.4 % compared to placebo ( mean 3.0 [ SD 6.12 ] vs 6.2 [ 9.89 ] , p = 0.01 ) .",3
The cumulative number of new gadolinium-enhancing T1 lesions was reduced by 67.9 % compared to placebo ( p = 0.002 ) .,3
Treatment-emergent adverse events included mild to moderate injection site erythema and decrease in platelet counts that returned to within the normal range after dosing .,3
"In patients with RRMS , ATL1102 significantly reduced disease activity after 8 weeks of treatment and was generally well-tolerated .",4
This trial provides evidence for the first time that antisense oligonucleotides may be used as a therapeutic approach in neuroimmunologic disorders .,4
"Sixty consecutive patients were randomized and completed the study , with 29 patients in the monopolar TURP group and 31 in the TURIS group .",3
"At baseline , the two groups were comparable in age , prostate volume , mean prostate-specific antigen value , International Prostate Symptom Score , and they had at least 12 months of follow-up .",3
"Declines in the mean postoperative serum Na + for bipolar and monopolar TURP groups were 1.2 and 8.7 mmol/L , respectively .",3
"However , there was no statistical difference in the decline in postoperative Hb between the two groups .",3
"The mean catheterization time was 26.6 and 52 hours in the bipolar and standard groups , respectively .",3
This difference was statistically significant as was the difference in the time to hospital discharge .,3
The IPSS and Qmax improvements were comparable between the two groups at 12 months of follow-up .,3
"No clinically relevant differences in short-term efficacy are existed between the two techniques , but bipolar TURP is preferable due to a more favorable safety profile and shorter catheterization duration .",4
The concordance rate between EFB and ESD specimens was not significantly different between the two groups [ 83.1 % ( 54/65 ) in JG vs. 79.1 % ( 53/67 ) in CG ] .,3
"On multivariate analyses , two or four EFBs significantly increased the cumulating concordance rate [ coefficients ; twice : 5.1 ( P = 0.01 ) , four times : 5.9 ( P = 0.02 ) ] .",3
"But , the concordance rate was decreased in high grade dysplasia ( coefficient -40.32 , P = 0.006 ) .",3
"Before ESD , the diagnostic accuracy of GENs was significantly increased not by the use of jumbo forceps biopsy but by increasing the number of biopsies .",4
One hundred and twenty-six patients were enrolled .,3
Sixty-three were randomly assigned docetaxel plus cisplatin and 63 docetaxel monotherapy .,3
Median age was 76 years ( range 70-88 ) .,3
The second planned interim analysis was performed on 112 assessable patients ( docetaxel/docetaxel plus cisplatin : 56/56 ) .,3
"Although the formal criterion for stopping the trial was not met , the Data and Safety Monitoring Committee recommended study termination on ethical grounds based on the interaction ( two-sided P = 0.077 , hazard ratios for 74/75 : 0.23 / 0.72 ) between age and subgroup and treatment arm , which suggested that docetaxel may not represent an adequate control arm regimen for the age subgroup of 70-74 years .",3
The interpretation of study results is limited due to early stopping .,4
Further study is needed to confirm survival benefit of platinum-based chemotherapy for elderly non-small-cell lung cancer [ UMIN-CTR ( www.umin.ac.jp/ctr/ ) ID : C000000146 ] .,4
Inclusion is planned to start in Q2 2014 .,4
"Although the study was stopped early due to lower than expected occurrence of the primary end points , sufficient data were available to assess the impact of the interventions on drug use and injection-related risk behavior .",3
"At week 26 , 22 % of ST-MAT participants had negative urinalyses for opioids compared with 57 % in the LT-MAT ( P < 0.001 ) .",3
"Differences disappeared in the year after treatment : at week 78 , 35 % in ST-MAT and 32 % in the LT-MAT had negative urinalyses .",3
Injection-related risk behaviors were significantly reduced in both groups after randomization .,3
Participants receiving BUP/NX 3 times weekly were more likely to reduce opioid injection while on active treatment .,4
Both treatment strategies were considered safe and associated with reductions in injection-related risk behavior .,4
These data support the use of thrice-weekly BUP/NX as a way to reduce exposure to HIV risk .,4
Continued access to BUP/NX may be required to sustain reductions in opioid use .,4
"During follow-up , 1,147 participants experienced at least one fall .",3
Users of anti-arrhythmic medication had an increased fall risk ( hazard ratio [ HR ] 1.61 ; 95 % confidence interval [ CI ] 1.12-2 .32 ) compared with non-users .,3
"Similarly , non-selective beta-blocker use was associated with an increased fall risk ( HR 1.41 [ 95 % CI 1.12-1 .78 ] ) , while statin use was associated with a lower risk ( HR 0.81 [ 95 % CI 0.71-0 .94 ] ) .",3
"Benzodiazepine use ( HR 1.32 [ 95 % CI 1.02-1 .71 ] ) , and antidepressant use ( HR 1.40 [ 95 % CI 1.07-1 .82 ] ) were associated with an increased fall risk .",3
Use of other cardiovascular and psychotropic medication was not associated with fall risk .,3
"Our results strengthen the evidence for an increased fall risk in community-dwelling elderly during the use of anti-arrhythmics , non-selective beta-blockers , benzodiazepines , and antidepressant medication .",4
Clinicians should prescribe these drugs cautiously and if possible choose safer alternatives for older patients .,4
"Of 100 patients , 6 in each group were excluded , and 44 patients in each group completed the study .",3
"There were no significant differences regarding the age , sex , and the number of dialysis sessions per week between the two groups .",3
"No difference was observed between the two groups in the laboratory investigations at the end of the study , except for a significant reduction in serum homocysteine level in the omega-3 group as compared to the placebo group ( P = .03 ) .",3
Our study showed a significant reduction regulated by omega-3 supplementation in serum homocysteine level which is a cardiovascular risk factor among hemodialysis patients .,4
Omega-3 can be considered as another homocysteine-reducing agent in this population .,4
"The 10-mg dose of FX006 produced pain relief that was improved relative to immediate-release triamcinolone acetonide at two through twelve weeks , although the difference in pain relief was not significant ( p 0.05 ) .",3
The 40-mg dose of FX006 produced pain relief that was improved at two through twelve weeks and was significantly superior to immediate-release triamcinolone acetonide at five to ten weeks ( p < 0.05 at each time point ) .,3
"At the 40-mg dose of FX006 , prespecified secondary analyses , including responder analyses and all Western Ontario and McMaster Universities subscales , were significantly superior ( p < 0.05 ) to immediate-release triamcinolone acetonide at eight weeks , and the time-weighted mean pain relief ( assessed with mean daily pain intensity scores ) was significantly superior to immediate-release triamcinolone acetonide over one to twelve weeks ( p = 0.04 ) .",3
The 60-mg dose did not provide additional improvement relative to the 40-mg dose .,3
Adverse events were generally mild and similar across all treatments .,3
"Intra-articular injection of FX006 , an extended-release formulation of triamcinolone acetonide , provided a clinically relevant improvement in pain relief in patients with knee osteoarthritis relative to immediate-release triamcinolone acetonide , the current standard of care .",4
"Of 2,440 isolated mitral operations , 29 % ( n = 698 ) were HR per REALISM criteria .",3
Median STS Predicted Risk of Mortality ( PROM ) for HR patients was 6.6 % compared with 1.6 % for non-HR patients ( p < 0.001 ) .,3
"The HR patients more commonly underwent MV replacement as well as urgent ( 30 % vs 19 % , p < 0.001 ) operations .",3
"High-risk patients incurred higher morbidity and mortality ( 7 % vs 1.6 % ) with longer intensive care unit ( 48 vs 41 hours ) and hospital stays ( 7 vs 6 days , all p < 0.001 ) .",3
"Among REALISM criteria , STS PROM 12 % or greater and high-risk STS criteria were the only criteria associated with mortality .",3
"Select REALISM criteria , including reoperation with patent grafts and functional MR with ejection fraction less than 0.40 , may not identify patients truly at high risk of death with surgery .",4
"In addition to conventional STS criteria , risk assessment by surgeons is essential to direct appropriate treatment allocation for high-risk mitral disease .",4
Patients with high use of immature defense style experienced greater symptom reduction in long-term than in short-term psychotherapy by the end of the 3-year follow-up ( 50 % vs. 34 % ) .,3
Patients with low use of immature defense style experienced faster symptom reduction in short-term than in long-term psychotherapy during the first year of follow-up ( 34 % vs. 19 % ) .,3
Knowledge of patients ' initial level of immature defense style may potentially be utilized in tailoring treatments .,4
Further research on defense styles as outcome predictors in psychotherapies of different types is needed .,4
Sixty patients were enrolled and randomized to the investigational group ( 28 of 29 patients completed the study ) or the control group ( 26 of 31 patients completed the study ) .,3
"At 6 months post-transplantation , composite efficacy failure rates including the incidences of biopsy-confirmed acute rejection in the investigational and control groups were 0 % and 10.7 % , respectively ; patient survival was 100 % in each group .",3
No difference in estimated glomerular filtration rate values were observed at 6 months post-transplantation ( p = 0.97 ) .,3
The safety and satisfaction profile ( immunosuppressant therapy barrier scale ) of once-daily tacrolimus was comparable with that of twice-daily tacrolimus ( p = 0.35 ) .,3
Conversion from twice-daily tacrolimus to once-daily tacrolimus one month after transplantation is safe and effective .,4
"In this double-blind , randomized , placebo-controlled , multicenter study , patients with New York Heart Association Class II to III chronic heart failure , left ventricular ejection fraction 45 % , and estimated glomerular filtration rate ( GFR ) 30 to 89 mL/min per 1.73 m ( 2 ) received intravenous serelaxin 30 g/kg per day or placebo for 24 hours .",3
"Primarily , we assessed the difference between serelaxin and placebo on renal plasma flow ( para-aminohippuric acid clearance ) and GFR ( iothalamate clearance ) over 8 to 24 hours .",3
All 22 patients from 1 clinical site were excluded from primary analyses before unblinding because of implausible measurements .,3
"The primary analysis comprised 65 patients , mean age was 68 ( 10 ) years , 89 % were male , mean estimated GFR was 64 ( 19 ) mL/min per 1.73 m ( 2 ) , and 34 % had New York Heart Association Class III symptoms .",3
"Renal plasma flow increased by 29 % with serelaxin and 14 % with placebo ( 13 % relative increase with serelaxin ; P = 0.0386 ) , whereas GFR changes did not differ significantly during 8 to 24 hours .",3
Filtration fraction increased by 36 % with serelaxin and 62 % with placebo ( 16 % relative decrease with serelaxin ; P = 0.0019 ) during 8 to 24 hours .,3
"Changes in systolic blood pressure were largely similar , and creatinine clearance did not differ between groups .",3
Adverse event rates were similar with serelaxin ( 20.5 % ) and placebo ( 25.0 % ) .,3
"In patients with chronic heart failure , serelaxin increased renal plasma flow and reduced the increase in filtration fraction compared with placebo , but did not affect GFR .",4
These results suggest beneficial renal hemodynamic effects in patients with chronic heart failure .,4
"The study population had a mean age of 57 years and was 42 % non-Hispanic African American , 28 % non-Hispanic white , and 27 % Hispanic .",3
"Those receiving the implementation intentions-based intervention had higher odds ( AOR = 1.83 , 95 % CI = 1.23 , 2.73 ) of completing CRC screening than the Comparison group .",3
"Those with higher self-efficacy for screening ( AOR = 1.57 , 95 % CI = 1.03 , 2.39 ) , history of asthma ( AOR = 2.20 , 95 % CI = 1.26 , 3.84 ) , no history of diabetes ( AOR = 1.86 , 95 % CI = 1.21 , 2.86 ) , and reporting they had never heard that `` cutting on cancer '' makes it spread ( AOR = 1.78 , 95 % CI = 1.16 , 2.72 ) were more likely to complete CRC screening .",3
The results of this study suggest that programs incorporating an implementation intentions approach can contribute to successful completion of CRC screening even among very low-income and diverse primary care populations .,4
Future initiatives to reduce CRC incidence and mortality disparities may be able to employ implementation intentions in large-scale efforts to encourage screening and prevention behaviors .,4
Individuals in the medical website group reported higher AS compared to the control group at post-manipulation after controlling for baseline health anxiety and baseline AS .,3
"Additionally , intolerance of uncertainty ( IU ) , an individual difference variable assessing negative beliefs about uncertainty , significantly moderated this effect such that medical website viewing only affected AS in participants with high IU but not in participants with low IU .",3
The limitations of the current study include the lack of individualization of the website viewing and the short duration of the website viewing .,4
The results of this study provide initial evidence that exposure to online medical information could increase risk for anxiety psychopathology in individuals with elevated IU .,4
"Additionally , these results provide support for a learning based model of the etiology of AS .",4
A total of 40 healthy adult male Korean subjects were enrolled in the study and randomized into two treatment groups .,3
"Ultimately , 33 subjects completed the study .",3
"During each treatment period , blood samples were collected at specific time intervals from 0 to 12 hours after administration of a single drug dose .",3
"The PK parameters including AUCt , AUC , Cmax , and tmax were calculated and the 90 % CIs of the ratio ( test/reference ) of the parameters were obtained by analysis of variance ( ANOVA ) on logarithmically transformed data .",3
The 90 % CIs of the geometric mean ratios for the test to reference formulations were as follows : 1.05 ( 0.97 - 1.13 ) for AUCt and 1.05 ( 0.96 - 1.14 ) for Cmax .,3
Statistical analysis confirmed that the 90 % CIs for these PK parameters were within the commonly accepted bioequivalence range of 0.8 - 1.25 .,3
There were no serious or unexpected TEAEs during the study .,3
"In the healthy adult Korean subjects , the test and reference formulations had similar PK parameters and similar plasma concentration-time profiles .",4
The test formulation of miglitol met the Korean regulatory criteria ( AUCt and Cmax ) for assuming bioequivalence and both formulations were generally well-tolerated .,4
The CRiS identifiers : KCT0000770 .,4
One hundred ten students were randomized .,3
"At the start of the clerkship , both groups had similar obstetrics exposure and confidence levels .",3
Only 15 students ( 13.9 % ) agreed they were ready to attempt a NVD with minimal supervision or independently .,3
This increased significantly to 43 students ( 39.4 % ) immediately after the session .,3
"At the end of the clerkship , 79 of 81 responding students ( 97.5 % ) were confident that they could attempt a NVD with minimal supervision or independently .",3
There were no significant differences noted between simulator groups at any point .,3
"The sessions were rated as equally useful and realistic , and this remained unchanged at the end of the clerkship .",3
Simulated NVD training using either an obstetrics mannequin or a birthing pelvis model provides clerkship students with a positive experience and increases confidence immediately .,4
"It should be implemented early in the rotation , as it appears the clerkship experience also plays a large role in terms of students ' confidence .",4
"Despite this , students maintain this type of learning is useful .",4
Effective simulation training can easily be incorporated into clerkship training .,4
There was no statistically significant difference between the groups for the change in CRQ dyspnoea score ( primary end point ) at 12months which amounted to 0.19 ( -0.26 to 0.64 ) units or other domains of the CRQ .,3
"There was no difference in the ESWT duration ( -10.06 ( -191.16 to 171.03 ) seconds ) , BMI , body fat , EQ5D , MET-minutes , activity rating , HADS , exacerbations or admissions .",3
A maintenance programme of three monthly 2h sessions does not improve outcomes in patients with COPD after 12months .,4
We do not recommend that our maintenance programme is adopted .,4
Other methods of sustaining the benefits of PR are required .,4
Personality functioning improved in all therapy groups .,3
"Both short-term therapies fared better than LPP during the first year of follow-up , by faster improvement in self-concept and decrease in immature defense style .",3
SFT also showed more early reduction of interpersonal problems .,3
"However , LPP thereafter showed larger and more sustained benefits than SFT and SPP , through greater changes in self-concept .",3
"Additionally , LPP outperformed SFT at the end of the follow-up in IIP and LPO , after adjustment for auxiliary treatment .",3
No differences were noted between the short-term therapies at any measurement point .,3
Auxiliary treatment was used relatively widely which limits generalization to exclusive use of short - or long-term therapy .,4
LPP seems to be somewhat more effective than short-term therapies in facilitating longterm changes in personality functioning .,4
"The ratio of plasma tyrosine plus phenylalanine ( tyrosine precursor ) to amino acids competing for brain uptake ( free-tryptophan , leucine , isoleucine , valine , methionine , threonine , and lysine ) increased 2.5-fold from rest in TYR and remained elevated throughout exercise ( P < 0.001 ) , whereas it declined in PLA from rest to preexercise ( P = 0.004 ) .",3
"Time-trial power output ( P = 0.869 ) and performance ( 34.8 6.5 and 35.2 8.3 min in TYR and PLA , respectively ; P = 0.4167 ) were similar between trials .",3
"Thermal sensation ( P > 0.05 ) , RPE ( P > 0.05 ) , core temperature ( P = 0.860 ) , skin temperature ( P = 0.822 ) , and heart rate ( P = 0.314 ) did not differ between trials .",3
These data indicate that acute tyrosine administration did not influence self-paced endurance exercise performance in the heat .,4
Plasma tyrosine availability is apparently not a key determinant of fatigue processes under these conditions .,4
"Ultrasound data in our study have shown a statistically significant decrease of TAIn in children given additional HT only after 5 years of follow-up , in unilateral cases and in the entirety of treated patients ; in bilateral cases this difference was not statistically significant .",3
"Patients with a TAIn > 20 % treated with preoperative and post-operative GnRHa therapy have a significant increase in testicular volume after 5 years of follow-up , as shown by the relative reduction of TAIn values .",4
"83 % of CCs regarded the IPB as a simple , accessible tool which raised awareness , and stimulated discussion and behaviour change .",3
15 CCs suggested minor modifications to format and content .,3
"Four levels of implementation were identified according to content , frequency , duration and coverage .",3
Most CCs ( 75 % ) achieved ` extended ' or ` essential ' IPB implementation .,3
Three universal factors affected all CCs : organisational change and resourcing ; working with hard to engage groups ; additional demands of participating in a research study .,3
Six specific factors were associated with the implementation level achieved : staff engagement and training ; staff continuity ; adaptability and flexibility ; other agency support ; conflicting priorities ; facilitation .,3
CCs achieving high implementation levels increased from 58 % ( no facilitation ) to 92 % with facilitation .,3
"Incorporating service provider perspectives and scientific evidence into health education initiatives enhances potential for successful implementation , particularly when supplemented by ongoing training and facilitation .",4
"Seventy-five patients were randomly assigned to one of four diets for 12 wk : high-saturated fatty acids ( HSFAs ) , high-MUFA ( HMUFA ) , and two low-fat , high-complex carbohydrate ( LFHCC ) diets supplemented with long-chain n-3 ( LFHCC n-3 ) PUFA or placebo .",3
"At the end of intervention , the LFHCC n-3 diet reduced plasma insulin , homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance , and nonsterified fatty acid concentration ( p < 0.05 ) as compared to baseline Spanish habitual ( BSH ) diet .",3
"Subcutaneous white adipose tissue ( WAT ) analysis revealed decreased EH-domain containing-2 mRNA levels and increased cbl-associated protein gene expression with the LFHCC n-3 compared to HSFA and HMUFA diets , respectively ( p < 0.05 ) .",3
"Moreover , the LFHCC n-3 decreased gene expression of glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase with respect to HMUFA and BSH diets ( p < 0.05 ) .",3
"Finally , proteomic characterization of subcutaneous WAT identified three proteins of glucose metabolism downregulated by the LFHCC n-3 diet , including annexin A2 .",3
RT-PCR analysis confirmed the decrease of annexin A2 ( p = 0.027 ) after this diet .,3
Our data suggest that the LFHCC n-3 diet reduces systemic insulin resistance and improves insulin signaling in subcutaneous WAT of MetS patients compared to HSFA and BSH diets consumption .,4
We randomized 491 patients ; 480 formed the final cohort .,3
Patients were 49 % male ; median age 70 years ; 42 % had previous acute coronary syndrome ; and 28 % diabetes .,3
The B-type natriuretic peptide level before hospital arrival was 100 pg/mL in 36.4 % .,3
Troponin was > 0.03 ng/mL in 13.4 % ; 3.6 % had troponin > 0.1 ng/mL .,3
"After adjudication , 16 % had acute coronary syndrome , 6.5 % acute heart failure , 3.3 % angina , and 74.2 % another diagnosis .",3
"The primary end point was 9.2 ( interquartile range , 7.3-11 .1 ) hours in the biomarker group and 8.8 ( interquartile range , 6.3-12 .1 ) hours in the usual care group ( P = 0.6 ) .",3
None died in the ambulance or in the emergency department : all-cause 30-day mortality was 2.1 % ( usual care ) and 1.7 % ( biomarker ) .,3
"To our knowledge , this is the first randomized trial of biomarkers before hospital arrival to guide emergency management of suspected acute cardiovascular disease which showed no benefit and was terminated early because of futility .",4
The results have important implications for the use of biomarkers in emergency management of heart disease and for the design of future randomized trials on this important topic .,4
Observational feasibility study of an intervention in a Norwegian general practice population.Six general practitioners ( GPs ) were recruited .,3
A screening questionnaire for MOH was sent to all 18-50 year old patients on these GPs ` list .,3
"GPs were taught BI , which was applied to MOH patients as follows : Severity of dependence scale ( SDS ) scores were collected and individual feedback was given of the relationship between the SDS , medication overuse and headache .",3
"Finally , advice to reduce medication was given .",3
Patients were invited to a headache interview three months after the BI .,3
"Main outcomes were feedback from GPs/patients about the feasibility and logistics of the study design , screening/recruitment process , BI and headache interviews .",3
Efficacy and patient-related outcomes were not focused .,3
The patients reported a high degree of acceptability of the methodology .,3
The GPs reported the BI to be feasible to implement within a busy practice and to represent a new and improved instrument for communication with MOH patients .,3
The BI requires further testing in a randomised controlled trial ( RCT ) in order to provide evidence of efficacy .,3
This feasibility study will be used to improve the BI for MOH and the design of a cluster-RCT .,4
The VAS pain scores in the treatment group at T2-T5 decreased significantly versus the control group ( P < 0.05 ) .,3
The Ramsay scores in the treatment group at T2-T3 increased and significantly differences existed with the control group ( P < 0.05 ) .,3
SAS scores showed significant differences between pre-operative and post-operative periods in the treatment group ( P < 0.05 ) .,3
The treatment group has shorter operative duration with 5 cases of dragging pain in the treatment group versus 25 in the control group ( P < 0.05 ) .,3
"During dragging reflex , HR was lower in the control group at T2 and T3 .",3
There were significant differences with the control group ( P < 0.05 ) .,3
A combination of dezoxine and dexmedetomidine provide multiple benefits for patients undergoing strabismus surgery .,4
"Compared with simple local anesthesia , it effectively attenuates pain and anxiety and provides mild sedation and better cooperation during strabismus surgery .",4
Serum triacylglycerol and other lipid concentrations were not significantly affected by consumption of Echium oil compared with HOSO .,3
Echium oil significantly increased percentage of EPA in red blood cell ( RBC ) membranes with 0.14 0.25 % ( mean s.d. ) compared with HOSO ( P = 0.02 ) .,3
No significant effects on docosahexaenoic acid in RBC membranes or on the omega-3 index were found .,3
"In healthy overweight and slightly obese subjects , an increased intake of SDA from Echium oil does not lower serum triacylglycerol concentrations .",4
"Despite an increase in the percentage of EPA in RBC membranes , the omega-3 index was not changed .",4
Twenty-four hour urinary protein excretion was significantly reduced by HQH treatment compared with that in the control group at Weeks 8 and 12 .,3
A much higher rate of complete remission of proteinuria was observed in the HQH group than in control group at Week 12 .,3
HQH administration also obviously reduced the extent of hematuria compared with that in the control group at Week 12 .,3
HQH treatment dramatically increased the rate of complete remission of hematuria compared with that in control group at Weeks 8 and 12 .,3
No obvious adverse events caused by HQH were observed .,3
HQH could be a new conservative therapy for IgAN patients who can not tolerate steroids and immunosuppressive agents .,4
The relapse rate after discontinuing treatment still needs further investigation .,4
"We enrolled 250 participants ( 118 carotid , 132 vertebral ) .",3
Mean time to randomisation was 365 days ( SD 191 ) .,3
"The major presenting symptoms were stroke or transient ischaemic attack ( n = 224 ) and local symptoms ( headache , neck pain , or Horner 's syndrome ; n = 26 ) .",3
126 participants were assigned to antiplatelet treatment versus 124 to anticoagulant treatment .,3
"Overall , four ( 2 % ) of 250 patients had stroke recurrence ( all ipsilateral ) .",3
"Stroke or death occurred in three ( 2 % ) of 126 patients versus one ( 1 % ) of 124 ( odds ratio [ OR ] 0335 , 95 % CI 0006-4233 ; p = 063 ) .",3
"There were no deaths , but one major bleeding ( subarachnoid haemorrhage ) in the anticoagulant group .",3
Central review of imaging failed to confirm dissection in 52 patients .,3
"Preplanned per-protocol analysis excluding these patients showed stroke or death in three ( 3 % ) of 101 patients in the antiplatelet group versus one ( 1 % ) of 96 patients in the anticoagulant group ( OR 0346 , 95 % CI 0006-4390 ; p = 066 ) .",3
"We found no difference in efficacy of antiplatelet and anticoagulant drugs at preventing stroke and death in patients with symptomatic carotid and vertebral artery dissection but stroke was rare in both groups , and much rarer than reported in some observational studies .",4
"Diagnosis of dissection was not confirmed after review in many cases , suggesting that radiographic criteria are not always correctly applied in routine clinical practice .",4
Pain did not differ between cooled and uncooled eyelids on the day of surgery .,3

"The primary study end point was time to death or a first nonfatal cardiovascular event ( myocardial infarction , hospitalization for angina , heart failure , or a peripheral vascular event ) .",3
This analysis included 2985 patients ( 77 % of randomized ) with serum samples at baseline and 2602 patients ( 67 % ) with samples at both baseline and week 20 .,3
The results demonstrated that a significantly larger proportion of patients randomized to cinacalcet had 30 % ( 68 % versus 28 % ) reductions in FGF23 .,3
"Among patients randomized to cinacalcet , a 30 % reduction in FGF23 between baseline and week 20 was associated with a nominally significant reduction in the primary composite end point ( relative hazard , 0.82 ; 95 % confidence interval , 0.69-0 .98 ) , cardiovascular mortality ( relative hazard , 0.66 ; 95 % confidence interval , 0.50-0 .87 ) , sudden cardiac death ( relative hazard , 0.57 ; 95 % confidence interval , 0.37-0 .86 ) , and heart failure ( relative hazard , 0.69 ; 95 % confidence interval , 0.48-0 .99 ) .",3
Treatment with cinacalcet significantly lowers serum FGF23 .,4
Treatment-induced reductions in serum FGF23 are associated with lower rates of cardiovascular death and major cardiovascular events .,4

"According to our study , diode laser vaporization ( 980 nm ) offers a safe and feasible procedure in the management of patients with symptomatic benign prostatic hypertrophy ; however , at longer follow-up the functional outcome of diode laser vaporization has been less efficient than TURP .",4
A pairedsamples t test identified a significant improvement in 2000-m performance of 5.23.9 s ( 1.1 % 1.7 % ; P = .034 ) .,3
"Two-way repeated-measures ANOVA revealed no significant treatment effect for HR ( 1778 vs 1779 beats/min , P = .817 ) , VO2 ( 46.16.5 vs 46.66.2 mLkg ( -1 ) min ( -1 ) , P = .590 ) , VE ( 121.814.7 vs 124.815.7 L/min , P = .490 ) , RPE , GI , or Thirst for CP and CC , respectively .",3

A relatively low dose of caffeine ( 1.30.1 mg/kg body mass ) in an isotonic carbohydrate gel ingested only 10 min before performance improved 2000-m rowing time by 5.27.8 s ( 1.1 % 1.7 % ) .,4
"A and B subgroup comparison at 24 hours revealed a statistically significant difference in the presence of pharyngolaryngeal discomfort in the PSV group ( 10 % versus 55 % respectively , P = 0.006 ) .",3
"Furthermore , when assessing the effect of maintaining a constant cuff pressure regardless of mode of ventilation , significantly fewer adverse effects were observed ( 8.3 % vs. 35 % , P = 0.001 ) when compared to the non-intervention subgroup .",3
Maintaining LMA cuff pressure in values which do not exceed 60 cmH2O probably contributes in decreasing pharyngolaryngeal discomfort independently of ventilation mode .,4
The ventilation mode which leads to the highest incidence of pharyngolaryngeal morbidity when cuff pressures are not closely monitored is PSV .,4
Baseline data were available 384 participants in the intervention group and 315 in the control group .,3
Twelve month data were available for 355 in the intervention group and 300 in the control group .,3
"The K10 score of patients in the intervention group ( 14.78 , SD 5.74 ) was lower at 12 months compared to the control group ( 15.97 , SD 6.30 ) .",3
"K10 at 12 months was significantly associated with the score at baseline and being unable to work but not with age , gender , change in behavioural risk factors or change in BMI .",3
The reduction of K10 in the intervention group demonstrates that a general practice based intervention to identify and manage vascular risk factors did not adversely impact on the psychological distress of the participants .,4
"The impact of the intervention on distress was not mediated by a change in the behavioural risk factors or BMI , suggesting that there must be other mediators that might explain the positive impact of the intervention on emotional wellbeing .",4
"Eligible subjects had 1 among : blood pressure 140/90 mmHg ; glycated hemoglobin 7 % ; LDL-cholesterol 160 or 100 mg/dL ( primary or secondary prevention , respectively ) ; BMI 30 ; current smoking .",3
The D&CM intervention included a teamwork including nurses as care managers for the implementation of tailored care plans .,3
Control group was allocated to usual-care .,3
The main outcome was the proportion of subjects achieving recommended clinical targets for 1 of uncontrolled CVD risk factors at 12-month .,3
"During 2008-2009 we enrolled 920 subjects in the Abruzzo/Marche regions , Italy .",3
"Following the exclusion of L'Aquila due to 2009 earthquake , final analyses included 762 subjects .",3
"The primary outcome was achieved by 39.1 % ( 95 % CI : 34.2-44 .2 ) and 25.2 % ( 95 % CI : 20.9-29 .9 ) of subjects in the intervention and usual-care group , respectively ( p < 0.001 ) .",3
"The D&CM intervention significantly increased the proportion of subjects who achieved clinical targets for both diabetes and hypertension , with no differences in hypercholesterolemia , smoking status and obesity .",3
"The D&CM intervention was effective in controlling cardiovascular risk factors , in particular hypertension and diabetes .",4
Numbers needed to treat were small .,4
Such intervention may deserve further consideration in clinical practice .,4
Infant outcomes were similar between groups .,3
"Relative to control caregivers , intervention caregivers at 6 months were less likely to score > 9 on the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale ( 7.9 % , vs 12.9 % , adjusted odds ratio [ OR ] 0.57 , 95 % confidence interval [ CI ] 0.34 to 0.94 ) , spend > 20 minutes attending infant wakings ( 41 % vs 51 % , adjusted OR 0.66 , 95 % CI 0.46 to 0.95 ) , or change formula ( 13 % vs 23 % , P < .05 ) .",3
"Infant frequent feeders ( > 11 feeds/24 hours ) in the intervention group were less likely to have daytime sleep ( OR 0.13 , 95 % CI 0.03 to 0.54 ) or cry problems ( OR 0.27 , 95 % CI 0.08 to 0.86 ) at 4 months .",3
"An education program reduces postnatal depression symptoms , as well as sleep and cry problems in infants who are frequent feeders .",4
The program may be best targeted to frequent feeders .,4
"Of 104 ( 53 PPI-CA , 51 ST ) randomized participants , 89 ( 49 PPI-CA , 40 ST ) had post-treatment results .",3
"Per-protocol treatment effectiveness was 59 % ( 95 % CI 45 % to 73 % ) for PPI-CA and 73 % ( 95 % CI 58 % to 87 % ) for ST. Based on intention to treat , effectiveness was 55 % ( 95 % CI 41 % to 69 % ) for PPI-CA and 57 % ( 95 % CI 43 % to 71 % ) for ST. Of 77 participants ( 43 PPI-CA , 34 ST ) with 100 % adherence , effectiveness was 63 % ( 95 % CI 43 % to 82 % ) for PPI-CA and 81 % ( 95 % CI 63 % to 99 % ) for ST.",3
"While additional evidence is needed to confirm that ST is more effective for Arctic Aboriginal communities than the Canadian standard H pylori treatment , these results show standard PPI-CA treatment to be inadequate for communities such as Aklavik .",4
Apixaban had no effect on naproxen pharmacokinetics .,3
"However , following co-administration , apixaban AUC ( 0 , ) , AUC ( 0 , t ) and Cmax were 54 % ( geometric mean ratio 1.537 ; 90 % confidence interval ( CI ) 1.394 , 1.694 ) , 55 % ( 1.549 ; 90 % CI 1.400 , 1.713 ) and 61 % ( 1.611 ; 90 % CI 1.417 , 1.831 ) higher , respectively .",3
"Mean ( standard deviation [ SD ] ) anti-Xa activity at 3h post-dose was approximately 60 % higher following co-administration compared with apixaban alone , 4.4 [ 1.0 ] vs. 2.7 [ 0.7 ] IUml ( -1 ) , consistent with the apixaban concentration increase following co-administration .",3
INR was within the normal reference range after all treatments .,3
AAI-PA was reduced by approximately 80 % with naproxen .,3
Co-administration had no impact beyond that of naproxen .,3
"Mean [ SD ] bleeding time was higher following co-administration ( 9.1 [ 4.1 ] min ) compared with either agent alone ( 5.8 [ 2.3 ] and 6.9 [ 2.6 ] min for apixaban and naproxen , respectively ) .",3
Co-administration of naproxen with apixaban results in higher apixaban exposure and appears to occur through increased apixaban bioavailability .,4
"The effects on anti-Xa activity , INR and inhibition of AAI-PA observed in this study were consistent with the individual pharmacologic effects of apixaban and naproxen .",4
"Baclofen , compared with placebo , significantly decreased the percent days of abstinence from alcohol-tobacco co-use ( p = 0.004 ) .",3
"Alcohol dependence severity moderated baclofen effects , with the higher severity group having the greater baclofen response ( p < 0.001 ) .",3
"Although the percent days of alcohol-tobacco co-use declined in both groups , this decline was greater after placebo than baclofen ( p < 0.001 ) .",3
Secondary analyses on alcohol or tobacco use alone suggested that the increase in percent days of co-abstinence was driven by the medication differences on heavy drinking days and on percent days smoking .,3
"In the cue-reactivity substudy , baclofen slightly decreased alcohol urge ( p = 0.058 ) and significantly reduced salivation ( p = 0.001 ) , but these effects were not related to cue type .",3
This study provides preliminary evidence suggesting a possible role of baclofen in the treatment of alcoholic smokers .,4
"However , the mixed results and the small sample require larger confirmatory studies .",4
"Following the safety announcements , there was a reduction in the number of allopurinol users in the first year of intervention ( -95.82 users per 100000 persons , 95 % CI , [ -166.84 , -24.80 ] ) and a continuous reduction afterward at a rate of -53.17 per 100000 persons per year .",3
"The utilization of benzbromarone grew steadily before 2005 but decreased drastically after the intervention , with a 30.12 % reduction in the number of users by the end of year 2008 .",3
There was no commensurate change in the number of probenecid or sulfinpyrazone users after the intervention .,3
"Further research is required to evaluate the direct impacts of the safety announcements on clinical outcomes , treatment costs , and patient 's quality of life .",4
ITT analysis revealed the eradication rates of 69.4 % ( 95 % CI : 61.2 % -76.6 % ) for esomeprazole therapy and 73.9 % ( 95 % CI : 65.9 % -80.6 % ) for lansoprazole therapy ( P = 0.4982 ) .,3
PP analysis showed eradication rate of 76.9 % ( 95 % CI : 68.6 % -83.5 % ) for esomeprazole therapy and 79.8 % ( 95 % CI : 71.9 % -86.0 % ) for lansoprazole therapy ( P = 0.6423 ) .,3
There were no differences in adverse effects between the two therapies .,3
Esomeprazole showed non-inferiority and safety in a 7 day-triple therapy for eradication of H. pylori compared with lansoprazole .,4

The proportion of subjects with baseline CLCR 63.5 mL/min was higher in the nephrotoxic group .,3
"Furosemide use ( odds ratio [ OR ] 2.91 , 95 % CI 1.64-5 .15 ) , hypertension ( OR 2.74 , 95 % CI 1.5-5 .0 ) , and vancomycin trough concentration 16.2 g/mL ( OR 2.33 , 95 % CI 1.25-4 .44 ) were each associated with nephrotoxicity during vancomycin therapy .",3
"In summary , the patient profile exhibiting the greatest risk ( OR 4.99 ) of developing kidney injury is one who has hypertension , is receiving furosemide therapy , and has vancomycin trough concentrations 16.2 g/mL .",4
"The corresponding 90 % CIs of AUClast and Cmax for the test/reference geometric mean ratio were 90.75 - 98.44 % and 92.28 - 98.33 % , respectively , under fasting conditions .",3
"In the fed state study , the 90 % CIs for the geometric mean ratio of test to reference drugs were 94.79 - 103.33 % for AUClast and 99.86 - 108.02 % for Cmax .",3
The test product is equivalent to the reference product in subjects under fasting and fed conditions within the Korean regulatory bioequivalence criteria .,4
"Both formulations were safe and well tolerated , and there were no noteworthy differences in the safety profiles between the test and reference drugs .",4
"Between Dec 8 , 2009 , and Dec 23 , 2011 , we randomly allocated 278 patients to treatment : 133 to placebo and 145 to idalopirdine .",3
132 patients in the placebo group and 140 in the experimental group were included in the final analysis .,3
"At week 24 , the change from baseline in ADAS-cog total score was +138 ( SD 053 ) in the placebo group and -077 ( 055 ) in the idalopirdine group ( treatment difference of -216 points , 95 % CI -362 to -069 ; p = 00040 ) .",3
"25 patients ( seven taking placebo and 18 taking idalopirdine ) discontinued treatment because of adverse events , the difference between groups being mainly due to asymptomatic transient increases in transaminase concentrations in some idalopirdine-treated patients .",3
"The most common adverse events ( occurring in > 3 % of patients ) were increased - glutamyltransferase ( 14 [ 10 % ] patients in the idalopirdine group vs two [ 2 % ] in the placebo group ) , diarrhoea ( six [ 4 % ] vs nine [ 7 % ] ) , urinary tract infection ( three [ 2 % ] vs nine [ 7 % ] ) , fall ( three [ 2 % ] vs eight [ 6 % ] ) , increased alanine aminotransferase ( nine [ 6 % ] vs none ) , and benign prostatic hyperplasia ( two [ 5 % ] vs none ) .",3

"Hypertension control was improved ( CPAP , 69.4 % for CPAP users vs. 43.2 % for control subjects ; P = 0.02 ) ; however , DBP did not reach statistical difference between the groups ( 8110 mm Hg vs. 798 mm Hg ; P = 0.49 ) .",3
"In the CPAP group , the Epworth Sleepiness Scale was markedly reduced ( 7.03.4 vs. 3.72.3 ; P < 0.001 ) .",3
"There was 1 SCCE in the CPAP group ( heart failure ) , and 5 SCCEs in the control group ( acute myocardial infarction : 2 ( with 1 death ) ; stroke : 3 ) , but there was no significant difference identified .",3
"Long-term CPAP application in uncontrolled hypertension with CHD and OSA significantly reduced daytime SBP , improved hypertension control and daytime sleepiness , and decreased the trend in SCCEs compared with control subjects .",4
"Data analysis for the 111 donor nephrectomy patients showed that glomerular filtration rates decreased in both groups over time , but changes were not clinically significant .",3
No difference was found in glomerular filtration rates ( in mL/min/1 .73 m2 ) between treatment and control groups at 1-year follow-up ( 89.29 vs 87.94 mL/min/1 .73 m2 ; P = .58 ) or at 1.5-year follow-up ( 88.54 vs 90.25 mL/min/1 .73 m2 ; P = .51 ) .,3

"No statistically significant or clinically relevant differences were found in immediate anxiety , depression , or infant feeding .",3
"Small , statistically significant differences favoring outpatient priming were found in seven of the nine subscales in the 7-week postpartum questionnaire .",3
"The direction of the effect was maintained , mostly with a larger effect size in women who received the intervention .",3
Women allocated to outpatient priming were more satisfied with their priming experience than women allocated to inpatient priming .,4
Being informed that they could go home after cervical priming did not increase women 's anxiety .,4
A total of 32 patients completed this trial .,3
The mean score decreased from 24.2 ( 4.8 ) to 17.6 ( 8.7 ) in the topiramate group ( P < 0.003 ) and from 20.9 ( 2.9 ) to 9.6 ( 3.5 ) in the placebo group during this trial ( P < 0.0001 ) .,3

Further study of the retention period is indicated .,4
"With time , QHI , PBI , and GI were significantly different between the renewal and the non-renewal groups ( QHI : P = 0.02 ; PBI : P = 0.04 ; GI : P < 0.01 ) , independent of subgroup .",3
"In the renewal group , QHI showed a significant decrease between baseline and each follow-up visit ( P < 0.01 ) .",3
"In the non-renewal group , there was a significant decrease compared to baseline up to and including week 16 ( P < 0.01 ) .",3
PBI in the renewal group showed no significant differences between baseline and each follow-up visit ( P > 0.05 ) .,3
"In the non-renewal group , only the normal head/soft subgroup exhibited a significant increase at week 24 ( P = 0.02 ) .",3
"The GI in the renewal group showed no difference between baseline and all follow-up visits , whereas in the non-renewal group , there was a significant decrease up to and including week 12 ( P < 0.05 ) .",3

HbA1c reduction at week 24 was -117 % in the acarbose group and -119 % in the metformin group .,3
"At week 48 , the HbA1c reduction was -111 % ( acarbose ) and -112 % ( metformin ) with difference 001 % ( 95 % CI -012 to 014 , p = 08999 ) .",3
"Six ( 2 % ) patients in the acarbose group and seven ( 2 % ) patients in the metformin group had serious adverse events , and two ( 1 % ) and four ( 1 % ) had hypoglycaemic episodes .",3
"This study provides evidence that acarbose is similar to metformin in efficacy , and is therefore a viable choice for initial therapy in Chinese patients newly diagnosed with type 2 diabetes .",4
"Thirty-eight general practices were randomised ( 20 in the intervention arm ) and 246 patients ( 50.2 % males , mean age 15 years ) were included in the primary outcome analysis .",3
Health-care professionals ' knowledge and confidence of the clinical management of seasonal allergic rhinitis improved .,3
"This did not , however , result in clinically or statistically significant improvements in RQLQ ( S ) : -0.15 , ( 95 % confidence interval , -0.5 to +0.2 ) .",3
"There were no differences in consultation frequency , treatments issued for seasonal allergic rhinitis or symptom scores .",3
"Although associated with increases in professionals ' self-assessed confidence and understanding of seasonal allergic rhinitis management , this intensive training workshop did not translate into improvements in adolescents ' disease-specific quality of life or a reduction in rhinitis symptoms .",4
Structural rather than cognitive social capital was significantly associated with CMD after controlling for socio-demographic variables .,3
"However , the two measures of structural social capital used , social networks and civic participation , were negatively and positively associated with CMD respectively .",3
` Social networks ' was negatively associated with CMD at both the individual and ecological levels .,3
"This result was maintained when contextual aspects of the physical environment ( neighbourhood incivilities ) were introduced into the model , suggesting that ` social networks ' was independent from characteristics of the physical environment .",3
"When ecological-level longitudinal analysis was conducted , ` social networks ' was not statistically significant after controlling for individual-level social capital at follow up .",3
"If we conceptually distinguish between cognitive and structural components as the quality and quantity of social capital respectively , the conclusion of this study is that the quantity rather than quality of social capital is important in relation to CMD at both the individual and ecological levels in disadvantaged urban areas .",4
"Thus , policy should support interventions that create and sustain social networks .",4
One of these is explored in this article .,4
Seventeen participants with spastic diplegia aged 13.71 + / - 3.62 years old participated .,3
"A significant difference of MAS was observed between pre - and post treatment ( 1 + , 1 ; p < 0.01 ) .",3

"A significant interaction of treatment by prior disease revealed an inverse association between n-3 fatty acids and vitality among myocardial infarction survivors ( mean difference = 2.9 ; 95 % CI : 0.5 , 5.2 ) .",3
There were no beneficial effects of supplementation with relatively low doses of B vitamins or n-3 fatty acids on health-related quality of life in cardiovascular disease survivors .,4
The adverse effects of B vitamins on activity limitations and of n-3 fatty acids on vitality among individuals with prior myocardial infarction merit confirmation .,4
Declining cognition was associated with increased number of mobility activities designated as risky ( 1.5 % of mobility activities performed in a risky manner per SPMSQ point ) and with increased rate of falls ( rate ratio = 1.16 for each unit change in SPMSQ score ) .,3
Risky performance of mobility activities mediated the relationship between cognition and rate of falls .,3
Risk assessment was based on the clinical judgment of experienced physical therapists .,4
"Cognition was measured with a relatively insensitive instrument , and only selected mobility activities were evaluated .",4
"Engagement in mobility ADL and IADL tasks in a risky manner emerged as a link between declining cognition and increased number of falls , suggesting a mechanism through which the rate of falls may increase .",4
"Specifically , declining cognition is associated with performance of mobility activities in an unsafe manner , thereby increasing the risk for falls .",4
A total of 35 infants were randomized to study group 1 ( moldable positioner ) and 27 infants to study group 2 ( moldable positioner and cranial cup ) .,3
The median hours per day on the cranial cup was 10.7 ( range 4.5-15 .3 ) .,3
Emesis and cardiorespiratory events were equally distributed for the moldable positioner and cranial cup devices in study group 2 .,3
"At discharge , more infants in study group 1 ( 46 % , n = 16 ) exhibited abnormal cranial measurements than those in study group 2 ( 19 % , n = 5 ) ( p = .03 ) .",3
"Rotating the cranial cup with the moldable positioner provides a feasible , safe , and potentially efficacious therapy for prevention of DP .",4
"The 45 women were randomized , 26 women completed 3 months of the study , and 17 women completed the entire 6 months of the study .",3
"During the 6 month intervention , menstrual cycles were more frequent in patients taking cinnamon compared with patients taking placebo ( median , 0.75 ; interquartile range , 0.5-0 .83 vs median , 0.25 ; interquartile range , 0-0 .54 ; P = .0085 ; Mann Whitney U ) .",3
"In patients taking cinnamon , menstrual cyclicity improved from baseline ( + 0.23 cycles/month 95 % confidence interval , 0.099-0 .36 ) , yet did not improve for women taking placebo .",3
"( P = .0076 , Wilcoxon signed rank ) .",3
Samples ( n = 5 ) of serum from the luteal phase in different patients within the cinnamon group were thawed and ovulatory progesterone levels ( > 3 ng/mL ) confirmed .,3
"Luteal phase progesterone levels ( > 3 ng/mL , n = 5 ) confirmed ovulatory menses .",3
Measures of insulin resistance or serum androgen levels did not change for either group .,3
These preliminary data suggest that cinnamon supplementation improves menstrual cyclicity and may be an effective treatment option for some women with PCOS .,4
"Mothers who had the GG/GA genotype and first trimester fever had an elevated risk of NTDs ( adjusted odds ratio , 11.73 ; 95 % confidence interval , 3.02-45 .58 ) as compared to absence of maternal first trimester fever and AA genotype after adjusting for maternal education , paternal education , and age , and had a significant interactive coefficient ( = 3.17 ) between maternal GG/GA genotype and first trimester fever .",3
"However , there was no interaction between offspring 's GG/GA genotype and maternal first trimester fever ( the interactive coefficient = 0.97 ) after adjusting for confounding factors .",3
Our findings suggested that the risk of NTDs was potentially influenced by a gene-environment interaction between maternal SLC19A1 rs1051266 GG/GA genotype and first trimester fever .,4
Maternal GG/GA genotype may strengthen the effect of maternal fever exposure on NTD risk in this Chinese population .,4
"Of the 541 patients treated , 395 patients ( 73 % ; 212 investigational and 183 control patients ) completed 7 years of clinical follow-up .",3

Improvement in PASI was highly correlated with pruritus improvement and improvements in DLQI total and domain scores at week 16 ( P < 001 ) .,3
Multiple hierarchical linear regression analyses showed a statistically significant ( P < 001 ) association between improvement in pruritus and improvement in DLQI total score and each of the six DLQI domain scores after adjusting for improvement in PASI .,3
Sobel tests indicated that pruritus had a significant mediation effect ( P < 005 ) on the association of PASI improvement with improvement in DLQI total score and all domains except the personal relationships score .,3
Pruritus appears to be an important mediator of the association between improvements in disease severity and HRQOL in patients with moderate-to-severe psoriasis .,4
Twenty participants completed the study .,3
Neither PIO nor EXS resulted in a detectable improvement in basal myocardial insulin sensitivity or diastolic function .,3
Post hoc analyses revealed sample sizes of more than 100 participants are needed to detect significant effects of these interventions on basal myocardial insulin sensitivity and function .,3
PIO or EXS alone did not significantly increase basal myocardial insulin sensitivity or LV diastolic function in HIV + individuals with peripheral metabolic complications .,4

Results showed training in the virtual pedestrian environment and especially individualized streetside training resulted in safer pedestrian behavior postintervention and at follow-up .,3
"As examples , children trained streetside entered safe traffic gaps more quickly posttraining than control group children and children trained streetside or in the virtual environment had somewhat fewer hits/close calls in postintervention VR trials .",3
Children showed minimal change in attention to traffic posttraining .,3
Children trained with videos/websites showed minimal learning .,3
Both individualized streetside training and training within virtual pedestrian environments may improve 7 - and 8-year-olds ' street-crossing safety .,4
Individualized training has limitations of adult time and labor .,4
Virtual environment training has limitations of accessibility and cost .,4
"Given the public health burden of child pedestrian injuries , future research should explore innovative strategies for effective training that can be broadly disseminated .",4
Multivariable predictors of reverse remodeling were as follows : ( 1 ) either of 2 BV fusion patterns : QRS normalization in leads V1 and V2 ( n = 66 [ 18 % ] ; odds ratio [ OR ] 3.71 ; 95 % confidence interval [ CI ] 1.26-10 .94 ) or a new or an increased R wave in leads V1-V2 ( n = 267 [ 71 % ] ; OR 1.55 ; 95 % CI 0.65-3 .65 ) ; ( 2 ) QRS difference -25 ms ( OR 2.35 ; 95 % CI 1.12-4 .91 ) ; and ( 3 ) good substrate ( low to moderate QRS score and LV activation time 110 ms ; OR 2.94 ; 95 % CI 1.68-5 .14 ) .,3
Remodeling rates were 40 % for poor substrate and persistent LBBB QRS complex ( absent BV fusion ; QRS type 3 : n = 42 [ 11 % ] ) and 97 % for the best BV QRS fusion pattern and greater reduction in electrical asynchrony ( larger QRS difference ) .,3
Easily determined QRS complex attributes before and after CRT predict LV reverse remodeling .,4

"At the end of the trial , inhalation score ( Mean estimated difference [ delta ] , 13.5 % ; 95 % Confidence Interval [ CI ] , 10.8-16 .1 ; P < .0001 ] and medication adherence [ ( delta , 8.51 % ; 95 % CI , 4.63-12 .4 ; P < .0001 ) were significantly higher in the intervention group compared to the control group .",3
"In the intervention group , a significantly lower hospitalization rate was observed ( 9 vs 35 hospitalizations ; Rate Ratio , 0.28 ; 95 % CI , 0.12-0 .64 ; P = .003 ) .",3
No other significant between-group differences were observed .,3
The PHARMACOP-trial demonstrates that pragmatic pharmacist care programs improve both inhalation technique and medication adherence in patients with COPD and could reduce hospitalization rates .,4
The protocolled intervention used in this trial was specifically designed for and evaluated in ( Belgian ) community pharmacies .,4
This may facilitate future implementation in the Belgian context .,4
Primary outcome data were available from 450 patients ( 81 % ) .,3
The mean baseline blood pressure was 143.1 / 80.5 mm Hg in the intervention group and 143.6 / 79.5 mm Hg in the control group .,3
"After 12 months , the mean blood pressure had decreased to 128.2 / 73.8 mm Hg in the intervention group and to 137.8 / 76.3 mm Hg in the control group , a difference of 9.2 mm Hg ( 95 % CI , 5.7-12 .7 ) in systolic and 3.4 mm Hg ( 95 % CI , 1.8-5 .0 ) in diastolic blood pressure following correction for baseline blood pressure .",3
"Multiple imputation for missing values gave similar results : the mean baseline was 143.5 / 80.2 mm Hg in the intervention group vs 144.2 / 79.9 mm Hg in the control group , and at 12 months , the mean was 128.6 / 73.6 mm Hg in the intervention group vs 138.2 / 76.4 mm Hg in the control group , with a difference of 8.8 mm Hg ( 95 % CI , 4.9-12 .7 ) for systolic and 3.1 mm Hg ( 95 % CI , 0.7-5 .5 ) for diastolic blood pressure between groups .",3
"These results were comparable in all subgroups , without excessive adverse events .",3
"Among patients with hypertension at high risk of cardiovascular disease , self-monitoring with self-titration of antihypertensive medication compared with usual care resulted in lower systolic blood pressure at 12 months .",4
"Reports of vulvar pain and dyspareunia were significantly reduced , whereas changes in the aggregate FSFI scores suggest significant improvement in sexual functioning in those receiving acupuncture vs. those who did not .",3
"Acupuncture did not significantly increase sexual desire , sexual arousal , lubrication , ability to orgasm or sexual satisfaction in women with vulvodynia .",3
This was the first randomized controlled pilot study to examine the use of acupuncture for the treatment of vulvodynia .,4
The acupuncture protocol was feasible and in this small sample appeared to reduce vulvar pain and dyspareunia with an increase in overall sexual function for women with vulvodynia .,4
This study should be replicated in a larger double-blinded randomized controlled trial .,4
"Greater reductions were observed for hemoglobin A1c and total cholesterol in the INT group ( P < .001 and P = .021 , respectively ) , whereas blood pressure reduction was similar .",3
Work capacity increased in INT and decreased in STAND ( P = .014 ) .,3
There was no significant between-group difference in the change in any of the echocardiographic parameters .,3
Two years of intensified multi-intervention in patients with T2D improved work capacity and glycemic and lipid control and had no significant benefit or harm on resting cardiac function .,4
Following capsaicin challenge the greatest average reduction in area of flare was seen for the 3 % formulation .,3
This dose was selected for further investigation .,3
Itch intensity induced by two challenge agents ( cowhage and histamine ) was assessed on the Computerised Visual Analogue Scale .,3
"The difference in average itch intensity ( Weighted Mean Over 15 Mins ) between the 3 % dose of SB705498 and placebo for the cowhage challenge was -0.64 , whilst the histamine challenge showed on average a -4.65 point change .",3
The 3 % topical formulation of SB705498 cream was clinically well tolerated and had target specific pharmacodynamic activity .,4
However there were no clinically significant differences on pruritus induced by either challenge agent in comparison to placebo .,4
SB705498 is unlikely to be of symptomatic benefit for histaminergic or non-histaminergic induced itch .,4
"The primary goal ( cardiovascular death , nonfatal myocardial infarction and nonfatal CMP ) occurred in 7.3 % ( 613 ) patients treated with saxagliptin and in 7.2 % ( 609 ) patients treated with placebo ( HR 1.00 , p < 0.001 for non inferiority ) .",3
"The main secondary goal ( cardiovascular death , myocardial infarction , vascular stroke , hospitalisation for a heart failure or angina pectoris and myocardial revascularisation ) occurred in 12.8 % ( 1,059 ) patients treated with saxagliptin and in 12.4 % ( 1,034 ) patients treated with placebo .",3
The number of hospitalisations for heart failure was 289 ( 3.5 % ) in the group treated with saxagliptin and 228 ( 2.8 % ) in the group treated with placebo ( p = 0.007 ) .,3
DPP4 inhibitor saxagliptin did not increase the occurrence of ischemic cardiovascular events but it inclined to an increased hospitalisation for heart failure in patients with the already present heart failure .,4
It did not increase the occurrence of pancreatitis .,4
"Simultaneously it significantly improved the Diabetes Mellitus control , which could signal a future improvement in cardiovascular goals .",4
"Nearly 75 % of our patients were taking AP/AT due to coronary heart disease ( CHD ) , peripheral arterial disease ( PAD ) , cardiac arrhythmia , or cardiovascular disease ( CVD ) .",3
"Patients ' questionnaire revealed that 31 % of our patients use acetylsalicylic acid in acute pain , which represents 10 % of the overall AP/AT cohort .",3
Head and neck surgery in patients with AP/AT showed an elevated bleeding frequency ( p = 0.006 ) without an elevated risk for internistic/neurological complications .,3
ICT/H were remarkably prolonged ( p = 0.006 ; p = 0.0004 ) .,3
Head and neck surgery in patients with AP/AT can be routinely performed .,4
"Indication for intensive care , endotracheal intubation , and tracheostomy should be made generously due to high requirements of airway management in ENT .",4
Ischemic/thrombembolic and bleeding risk requires careful assessment in an interdisciplinary setting .,4
"In both HVs and GERD patients , baclofen reduced the frequency of postprandial reflux events .",3
"The oesophago-gastric insertion angle in GERD patients was reduced ( -4.1 1.8 , P = 0.025 ) , but was unchanged in healthy controls .",3
"In both study groups , baclofen augmented lower oesophageal sphincter ( LES ) pressure ( HVs : +7.3 1.8 mmHg , P < 0.0001 , GERD : +4.50 1.49 mmHg , P < 0.003 ) and increased LES length ( HVs : +0.48 0.11 cm , P < 0.0003 , GERD : +0.35 0.06 cm , P < 0.0001 ) .",3
Baclofen inhibits transient LES relaxations and augments LES pressure and length .,4
"Additionally , baclofen has effects on the ` functional anatomy ' of the OGJ and proximal stomach in GERD patients , which may suppress reflux by means of a ` flap valve ' mechanism .",4
"In the Clinical Group , the True Clinical Tuffier 's line met the Assumed Tuffier 's line in only 12 % of the patients .",3
"In the remaining patients , wrong leveling ranged from one space above in 80 % to 2 spaces above in 7 % and in 1 % of patients the line was at L2 .",3
"In the Ultrasound Group , wrong leveling occurred in 22 % of patients .",3
The Ultrasound misidentification was less than one level in 17 % and one level in 5 % of patients .,3
Ultrasound examination had a true limitation of 2 % of patients .,3
"Ultrasound examination of the spine is recommended in patients planned for spinal anesthesia , as it is superior to clinical assessment in identification of the interspinous levels .",4
This will decrease the hazard of spinal cord trauma .,4
"No statistically significant difference was found regarding complications , including graft necrosis , graft detachment , or seroma formation .",3
"At week 8 , significantly lower Vancouver Scar Scale scores for vascularity , pliability , height , and total score were found in group A compared with group B.",3
"At week 12 , lower scores for pliability and height and total scores were identified in group A compared with group B.",3
"For cases with traumatic full-thickness skin defects on the extremities , a statistically significant better result was achieved with cograft of acellular dermal matrix with autologous split-thickness skin graft than with autologous split-thickness skin graft alone in terms of Vancouver Scar Scale score .",4
"Between Feb 19 , 2001 , and April 29 , 2010 , 4823 patients were enrolled at 34 centres from nine European countries , of whom 4806 were eligible for randomisation .",3
2402 patients were randomly assigned to receive axillary lymph node dissection and 2404 to receive axillary radiotherapy .,3
"Of the 1425 patients with a positive sentinel node , 744 had been randomly assigned to axillary lymph node dissection and 681 to axillary radiotherapy ; these patients constituted the intention-to-treat population .",3
Median follow-up was 61 years ( IQR 41-80 ) for the patients with positive sentinel lymph nodes .,3
"In the axillary lymph node dissection group , 220 ( 33 % ) of 672 patients who underwent axillary lymph node dissection had additional positive nodes .",3
Axillary recurrence occurred in four of 744 patients in the axillary lymph node dissection group and seven of 681 in the axillary radiotherapy group .,3
5-year axillary recurrence was 043 % ( 95 % CI 000-092 ) after axillary lymph node dissection versus 119 % ( 031-208 ) after axillary radiotherapy .,3
The planned non-inferiority test was underpowered because of the low number of events .,3
"The one-sided 95 % CI for the underpowered non-inferiority test on the hazard ratio was 000-527 , with a non-inferiority margin of 2 .",3
"Lymphoedema in the ipsilateral arm was noted significantly more often after axillary lymph node dissection than after axillary radiotherapy at 1 year , 3 years , and 5 years .",3
Axillary lymph node dissection and axillary radiotherapy after a positive sentinel node provide excellent and comparable axillary control for patients with T1-2 primary breast cancer and no palpable lymphadenopathy .,4
Axillary radiotherapy results in significantly less morbidity .,4
"The number of incidents increased in both intervention groups , to 82 and 224 in intervention I and II respectively .",3
"Adjusted for baseline number of incidents , practice size and accreditation status , the study showed that practices that additionally participated in the workshop reported 42 ( 95 % confidence interval [ CI ] = 9.81 to 177.50 ) times more incidents compared to the control group .",3
Practices that only completed the questionnaire reported 5 ( 95 % CI = 1.17 to 25.49 ) times more incidents .,3
There were no statistically significant differences in staff perception of patient safety culture at follow-up between the three study groups .,3
Educating staff and facilitating discussion about patient safety culture in their own practice leads to increased reporting of incidents .,4
It is beneficial to invest in a team-wise effort to improve patient safety .,4
"There were no differences in superimposed pre-eclampsia ( SPE ) , severe hypertension , preterm delivery , placental abruption , oligohydramnios , intrauterine growth restriction , or perinatal mortality between the groups .",3
"Group B had higher gestational age at delivery ( P = 0.001 ) and birth weight ( P = 0.01 ) , but lower cesarean ( OR 3.4 ; 95 % CI , 1.2-10 .3 ; P = 0.03 ) and neonatal care unit admission ( OR 5.4 ; 95 % CI , 1.4-21 .0 ; P = 0.01 ) rates .",3
More women with SPE were diagnosed before than after 37 weeks in group B ( P = 0.01 ) .,3
"Overall , patients who developed SPE had more adverse pregnancy outcomes than those who did not .",3
Mild to moderate chronic hypertension could be managed expectantly up to 41 weeks if SPE did not develop .,4
Similar preoperative parameters were established in the four series .,3
"OP and BPEP were characterized by resembling operating times , while TURis and TUVis displayed prolonged surgical durations .",3
TURis emphasized a substantially decreased mean resected tissue weight .,3
"TUVis showed the lowest mean hemoglobin level drop , followed by TURis and BPEP ( equivalent results ) and finally OP ( highest bleeding ) .",3
"OP described the longest mean catheterization period and hospital stay , followed by TURis , and afterward by TUVis and BPEP ( similar data ) .",3
"During the follow-up period , statistically equivalent IPSS , QoL , Qmax , and PVR outcomes were established for OP , BPEP , and TURis .",3
"TUVis displayed significantly smaller Qmax improvements , but similar other functional features .",3
Significantly lower mean PSA levels were determined secondary to OP and BPEP when compared to bipolar resection and subsequently to vaporization .,3
"OP and BPEP emphasized the highest surgical efficiency ( prolonged postoperative recovery for OP ) , while TUVis displayed the lowest hemorrhagic risks .",4
"On the medium term , generally resembling functional outcomes were determined for the four techniques , with significantly decreased mean PSA values secondary to OP and BPEP .",4
"Patients included 145 with rheumatoid arthritis , 57 with systemic lupus erythematosus , 173 with osteoarthritis , 348 with other inflammatory diseases , and 257 with other noninflammatory diseases .",3
"Overall , PATGL = DOCGL in 509 ( 52 % ) , PATGL > DOCGL in 371 ( 38 % ) , and DOCGL > PATGL in 100 ( 10 % ) .",3
"PATGL > DOCGL was associated significantly with older age , female sex , low formal education , Hispanic ethnicity , not working , high MDHAQ physical function and pain scores , and high scores for fatigue , poor sleep , anxiety , depression , and self-report joint count , which are not available on the HAQ .",3
Pain and fatigue were significant in a final multinomial logistic regression ; the other variables may raise awareness of discordance to clinicians .,3
"Global estimates of patients indicated significantly poorer status than estimates of their physicians in 38 % of 980 patients with rheumatic conditions , and were associated with demographic and MDHAQ scores , 5 of which are not available on the HAQ .",4
"The Swede scores obtained by nurses and doctors using the Gynocular and stationary colposcope showed high agreement with a statistic of 0.858 and 0.859 , respectively , and no difference in detecting cervical lesions in biopsy .",3
Biopsy detected CIN 2 + in 39 ( 4.2 % ) women .,3
Our study showed that VIA nurses can perform colposcopy .,4
There was no significant differences compared to doctors in detecting cervical lesions by stationary colposcope or the Gynocular using the Swede score system .,4
Swede scores obtained by nurses using the Gynocular could offer an accurate cervical diagnostic approach in low resource settings .,4
"Twenty-nine percent of participants reported engaging in at least one unhealthy weight loss behavior ( e.g. , fasting , purging ) over the last 30 days , with no differences by gender .",3
"Self-report of at least one unhealthy weight loss behavior was associated with report of symptoms of depression ( e ( B ) = 1.14 [ confidence interval , CI : 1.08-1 .20 ] ) , adjusting for potential confounders .",3
Interactions between gender and depression were not significant ( e ( B ) = 1.04 [ CI : 0.93-1 .16 ] ) .,3
"Among an overweight or obese sample of college students , unhealthy weight loss practices were equally common in both genders , and students with depressive symptomatology were at greatest risk .",4
Obesity interventions targeting overweight or obese college students should educate both men and women about the dangers of unhealthy weight loss practices .,4
"In addition , screening for depression can help identify students who would benefit from additional supportive and coping strategies and resources .",4
Preterm birth and its complications are a leading cause long-term morbidity among Canadian children .,4
Strategies to mitigate this risk are urgently required .,4
"As mother 's own milk has been shown to improve neurodevelopment , it is essential to ascertain whether pasteurized donor milk will confer the same advantage over formula without undue risks and at acceptable costs .",4
Knowledge translation from this trial will be pivotal in setting donor milk policy in Canada and beyond .,4
"After 25 years , adding RT to cyclophosphamide in pre-menopausal women raised the mortality from heart disease from zero to 0.8 % ( p = 0.04 ) .",3
"In post-menopausal women , adding RT to Tam raised the mortality from heart disease from 10.5 % to 18.4 % ( p = 0.005 ) .",3
In post-menopausal women mortality due to cerebrovascular disease increased from 3.4 % to 8.7 % by adding RT to Tam ( p = 0.015 ) .,3
The differences were not evident until in the second decade of follow-up .,3
"In spite of differences in specific causes of death , there were no significant differences between the treatment arms concerning morbidity or overall mortality .",3
"Postmastectomy radiotherapy to the chest wall and loco-regional lymph nodes including the parasternal lymph nodes as delivered in the end of the seventies did not reduce overall mortality , but gave a significantly increased risk of death from heart and cerebrovascular disease , which appeared during the second decade after radiotherapy .",4
Response rates were 55 % for the biweekly regimen and 40 % for the standard regimen .,3
"Median overall and progression-free survival times were 19.7 and 6.2 months , respectively , for the biweekly regimen , and 11.8 and 2.8 months , respectively , for the standard GC regimen .",3
Hematologic toxicity was prominent .,3
"However , the incidence of grade 1 or 2 thrombocytopenia was significantly lower in the biweekly than in the standard GC regimen ( p < 0.05 ) .",3
Nonhematologic toxicity was mild .,3
A biweekly GC regimen was better tolerated than a standard GC regimen in patients with advanced NSCLC .,4
Celiac disease was confirmed by means of biopsies in 77 children .,3
"To avoid underestimation of the frequency of celiac disease , 3 additional children who received a diagnosis of celiac disease according to the 2012 European Society for Pediatric Gastroenterology , Hepatology , and Nutrition diagnostic criteria ( without having undergone biopsies ) were included in the analyses ( 80 children ; median age , 2.8 years ; 59 % were girls ) .",3
"The cumulative incidence of celiac disease among patients 3 years of age was 5.2 % ( 95 % confidence interval [ CI ] , 3.6 to 6.8 ) , with similar rates in the gluten group and the placebo group ( 5.9 % [ 95 % CI , 3.7 to 8.1 ] and 4.5 % [ 95 % CI , 2.5 to 6.5 ] , respectively ; hazard ratio in the gluten group , 1.23 ; 95 % CI , 0.79 to 1.91 ) .",3
"Rates of elevated levels of anti-transglutaminase type 2 and antigliadin antibodies were also similar in the two study groups ( 7.0 % [ 95 % CI , 4.7 to 9.4 ] in the gluten group and 5.7 % [ 95 % CI , 3.5 to 7.9 ] in the placebo group ; hazard ratio , 1.14 ; 95 % CI , 0.76 to 1.73 ) .",3
"Breast-feeding , regardless of whether it was exclusive or whether it was ongoing during gluten introduction , did not significantly influence the development of celiac disease or the effect of the intervention .",3
"As compared with placebo , the introduction of small quantities of gluten at 16 to 24 weeks of age did not reduce the risk of celiac disease by 3 years of age in this group of high-risk children .",4

"At 3 months after surgery , auto-crosslinked HA gel resulted in significantly higher effective rate for reduction of adhesion , the effective rate were 76 % ( 42/55 ) and 48 % ( 27/56 ) respectively ( P = 0.000 9 ) ; the total AFS score of treatment group was 2.1 1.1 , and significantly lower than that of control group ( 3.7 2.5 , P = 0.000 8 ) .",3
"Application of auto-crosslinked HA gel after surgery significantly enhanced the improvement for each individual patient with regard to their adhesive type and menstrual pattern ( P = 0.037 8 , P = 0.000 4 ) .",3
"The treatment group had significantly lower proportion of patients with moderate to severe adhesive stages than that of control group [ 13 % ( 7/55 ) versus 38 % ( 21/56 ) , P = 0.000 6 ] .",3
No adverse events and complications were observed .,3
"Auto-crosslinked HA gel coule be able to reduce IUA , decrease adhesion severity , and improve menopause postoperatively .",4
This absorbable auto-crosslinked HA gel is proposed as a barrier for preventing IUA after intrauterine procedures .,4
This paper describes the design and deployment of a trial SIAM ; an easily reproducible intervention that aims to reduce suicide risk in adults after self-harm .,4
It utilizes several characteristics of interventions that have shown a significant reduction in the number of suicide reattempts .,4
We propose to assess its efficacy in reducing suicide reattempt in the suicide attempter ( SA ) population .,4
"TIPS will trial a comprehensive , multi-component and multidisciplinary collaborative approach to improving thrombolysis rates at multiple sites .",4

"Magnetic resonance imaging quantification revealed that the trochanteric flip osteotomy group maintained almost full perfusion ( mean , 96 % for the femoral head and 98 % for the head-neck junction ) .",3
"The standard posterior approach almost completely compromised perfusion ( mean , 4 % for the femoral head and 8 % for the head-neck junction ) .",3
"Six specimens in the modified posterior approach group demonstrated partial perfusion ( mean , 32 % in the femoral head and 26 % in the head-neck junction ) .",3
"Three specimens in the modified posterior approach group demonstrated almost full perfusion ( mean , 96 % in the femoral head and 97 % in the head-neck junction ) .",3
Gross dissection revealed that all specimens in the standard posterior approach group and seven of ten in the modified posterior approach group sustained disruption of the ascending branch of the medial femoral circumflex artery .,3
All specimens in the standard posterior approach group demonstrated disruption of the inferior retinacular artery .,3
The inferior retinacular artery remained intact in nine of ten specimens in the modified posterior approach group .,3
One specimen in the modified posterior approach group that had disruption of both the ascending medial femoral circumflex artery and inferior retinacular artery demonstrated a substantial decrease in perfusion ( 7 % in the femoral head and 5 % in the head-neck junction ) .,3
The trochanteric flip osteotomy preserves the vascular supply to the femoral head and head-neck junction .,4
The standard posterior approach disrupts the vascular supply and should be completely abandoned for surgical hip dislocation .,4
"Despite reduced enhancement , substantial perfusion of the femoral head and head-neck junction was present in the modified posterior approach group , likely because of the preservation of the inferior retinacular artery .",4
"The modified posterior approach produced variable results , indicating that improvement to the modified posterior approach is needed .",4
Our study provides previously unreported quantitative magnetic resonance imaging data on the perfusion to the femoral head and head-neck junction during common surgical approaches to the hip .,4
The impact of emerging sequencing technologies on patient care is unclear .,4
We have designed a process of interpreting WGS results and delivering them to physicians in a way that anticipates how we envision genomic medicine will evolve in the near future .,4
"That is , our WGS report provides clinically relevant information while communicating the complexity and uncertainty of WGS results to physicians and , through physicians , to their patients .",4
This project will not only illuminate the impact of integrating genomic medicine into the clinical care of patients but also inform the design of future studies .,4
"Both interventions yielded significant decreases in weight , FFM , REE , and leptin , whereas a significant time group interaction was noted for FM ( greater decrease in FM in the diet + resistance training group ) ( P < .05 for all outcomes ) .",3
"No significant differences in TEE , physical activity EE , and PYY were noted between baseline and after the intervention .",3
"Age , FFM , leptin , and PYY were the best predictors of baseline REE ( R ( 2 ) = 0.77 ; P = .0001 ) , whereas age , FFM , and FM were associated with REE after the intervention ( R ( 2 ) = 0.88 ; P = .0001 ) .",3
"The same predictors , except for leptin , were significantly related to TEE at baseline ( R ( 2 ) = 0.70 ; P = .0001 ) and after the intervention ( R ( 2 ) = 0.29 ; P = .0001 ) , whereas only PYY was a significant predictor of physical activity EE at baseline and after the intervention .",3
Changes in FM and leptin accounted for 27 % of the variance in REE ( P = .0001 ) .,3
Greater predicted vs measured REE was noted after the intervention ( P = .02 ) .,3
"However , leptin and PYY were not significant predictors of the differences between postintervention measurement and predicted REE .",3
Leptin and FM were strong contributors to changes in REE .,4
"However , leptin and PYY were not significant predictors of the differences between predicted and measured REE after the intervention .",4
"In both groups of patients in pain reduction was significant adjustment contractions and after 1 hour was 94.5 % in EA , and PVB group -- 78.7 % of the initial values .",3
"Under EA opening cervix was statistically significantly greater than in the PVB ( 192.5 ( 145 , 302 ) vs 172.5 ( 112 , 210 ) min ) p < 0.05 .",3
"Second stage of labor was also shorter in the PVB than in the EA ( 30.4 ( 10.2 , 46.5 ) vs 59.8 ( 40.2 , 81.5 ) min ) , in the control group it was -- 40.6 ( 21.3 , 55.4 ) min , p < 0.05 .",3
PVB was observed in the group of more stable hemodynamics than in the EA for the entire period of observation .,3
There were no adverse effects on the fetus and the newborn in the arms of the study .,3
"The proposed lumbar paravertebral block is simple to perform , is effective in reducing pain in the first stage of labor does not require continuous hemodynamic monitoring may be used for the treatment of birth dystocia and is a good alternative when the use of epidural analgesia during labor is limited .",4
"Women in the intervention group gained less weight ( adjusted mean difference , 1.039 kg ; 95 % CI , 0.534-1 .545 kg ; P < .001 ) and were less likely to gain weight above the IOM recommendations ( odds ratio , 0.625 ; 95 % CI , 0.461-0 .847 ) compared with those in the standard care group .",3
"The main treatment effects according to body mass index category were that normal weight women in the intervention group gained less weight ( adjusted mean difference , 1.393 kg ; 95 % CI , 0.813-1 .972 kg ; P < .001 ) and were less likely to gain weight above the IOM recommendations ( odds ratio , 0.508 ; 95 % CI , 0.334-0 .774 ) than normal weight women who received standard care .",3
No significant treatment effect was observed in overweight or obese women .,3
"Supervised exercise of light to moderate intensity can be used to prevent excessive gestational weight gain , especially in normal weight women .",4
"A cluster randomised trial was implemented with 5,233 children in 101 government primary schools on the south coast of Kenya in 2010-2012 .",3
The intervention was delivered to children randomly selected from classes 1 and 5 who were followed up for 24 months .,3
"Once a school term , children were screened by public health workers using malaria rapid diagnostic tests ( RDTs ) , and children ( with or without malaria symptoms ) found to be RDT-positive were treated with a six dose regimen of artemether-lumefantrine ( AL ) .",3
"Given the nature of the intervention , the trial was not blinded .",3
The primary outcomes were anaemia and sustained attention .,3
Secondary outcomes were malaria parasitaemia and educational achievement .,3
Data were analysed on an intention-to-treat basis .,3
"During the intervention period , an average of 88.3 % children in intervention schools were screened at each round , of whom 17.5 % were RDT-positive .",3
80.3 % of children in the control and 80.2 % in the intervention group were followed-up at 24 months .,3
"No impact of the malaria IST intervention was observed for prevalence of anaemia at either 12 or 24 months ( adjusted risk ratio [ Adj.RR ] : 1.03 , 95 % CI 0.93-1 .13 , p = 0.621 and Adj.RR : 1.00 , 95 % CI 0.90-1 .11 , p = 0.953 ) respectively , or on prevalence of P. falciparum infection or scores of classroom attention .",3
"No effect of IST was observed on educational achievement in the older class , but an apparent negative effect was seen on spelling scores in the younger class at 9 and 24 months and on arithmetic scores at 24 months .",3
"In this setting in Kenya , IST as implemented in this study is not effective in improving the health or education of school children .",4
"Possible reasons for the absence of an impact are the marked geographical heterogeneity in transmission , the rapid rate of reinfection following AL treatment , the variable reliability of RDTs , and the relative contribution of malaria to the aetiology of anaemia in this setting .",4
"Differences in terms of social participation , commitment and leadership were present in the clusters .",3
The results showed the effectiveness of the intervention package in comparison with the routine control programme .,3
Differences regarding the costs of the intervention were reasonable and could be adopted by public health services .,3
Embedding social participation and environmental management for improved dengue vector control was feasible and significantly reduced vector densities .,4
Such a participatory ecohealth approach offers a promising alternative to routine vector control measures .,4
"After eight weeks , treatment with olmesartan induced a significant reduction in ABPM in patients [ ( 9 3 ) / ( 11 3 ) mmHg ( 1 mmHg = 0.133 kPa ) ] , which is similar with the reduction by Olmetec [ ( 9 4 ) / ( 9 5 ) mmHg ] , P > 0.05 .",3
"This situation holds for BPV with the standard deviations of 24 h , systolic blood pressure/diastolic blood pressure of pre-treatment and pro-treatment were ( 10 2 ) / ( 11 3 ) mmHg vs ( 10 3 ) / ( 12 2 ) mmHg in olmesartan group , and ( 10 3 ) / ( 11 3 ) mmHg vs ( 12 3 ) / ( 12 4 ) mmHg in Olmetec group .",3
( 3 ) There is no difference in the rate of adverse event between olmesartan ( 10.42 % ) and Olmetec ( 8.33 % ) treatment ( P > 0.05 ) .,3

"The incidence of HFSR on the hands , however , was similar in both arms .",3
The median time to grade 2 or 3 HFSR on the soles of the feet was also significantly longer in arm A than in arm B ( P = 0.03 ) .,3
These results indicate that a hydrocolloid dressing containing ceramide prevented the worsening of HFSR caused by sorafenib in metastatic RCC patients .,4
The results of this trial will determine the relative effectiveness of a 12-week programme of FES-assisted cycling versus passive cycling in preventing muscle atrophy and maintaining skeletal integrity after spinal cord injury .,4
"CHARM enrolled 7599 patients with New York Heart Association class II to IV HF , of whom 5426 had a history of previous HF hospitalization .",3
Cox proportional hazards regression models were used to assess the association between time from previous HF hospitalization and randomization and the primary outcome of cardiovascular death or unplanned admission to hospital for the management of worsening HF during a median of 36.6 months .,3
"For patients with HF and reduced or preserved ejection fraction , rates of cardiovascular mortality and HF hospitalization were higher among patients with previous HF hospitalization than those without .",3
The risk for mortality and hospitalization varied inversely with the time interval between hospitalization and randomization .,3
Rates were higher for patients with HF and reduced ejection fraction within each category .,3
Event rates for those with HF with preserved ejection fraction and a HF hospitalization in the 6 months before randomization were comparable with the rate in patients with HF and reduced ejection fraction with no previous HF hospitalization .,3
Rates of cardiovascular death or HF hospitalization are greatest in those who have been previously hospitalized for HF .,4
"Independent of EF , rates of death and readmission decline as time from HF hospitalization to trial enrollment increased .",4
Recent HF hospitalization identifies a high-risk population for future clinical trials in HF and reduced ejection fraction and HF with preserved ejection fraction .,4
Three REE measurements were performed in each of 12 infants at age 2015.8 days .,3
Mean GA was 30.172.44 weeks and mean birthweight was 1246239g .,3
REE was similar during the first 10-min of all three randomization periods .,3
"During the next 10-min period , infants exposed to music by Mozart had a trend toward lower REE than when not exposed to music .",3
This trend became significant during the third 10-min period .,3
"In contrast , music by Bach or no music did not affect significantly REE during the whole study .",3
"On average , the effect size of Mozart music upon REE was a reduction of 7.7 % from baseline .",3
"Mozart music significantly lowers REE in preterm infants , whereas Bach music has no similar effect .",4
"We speculate that ` Mozart effect ' must be taken into account when incorporating music in the therapy of preterm infants , as not all types of music may have similar effects upon REE and growth .",4
There were a total of thirty three patients with a mean age of 51.4 + - 13.7 .,3
"In group one , mean age of patients was 54.1 + - 13.2 and 48.68 + - 14.1 in group two .",3

"Additionally , in the OA group , the good quality embryo rate was similar after IVF or ICSI ( p > 0.05 ) .",3
"However , in the O group , the good quality embryo rate was significantly higher after ICSI than after IVF ( p < 0.05 ) .",3
Couples with moderate oligozoospermia or moderate oligoasthenozoospermia did not influence the major indices of IVF .,4
"Because of the uncertainties concerning the safety of ICSI , couples with moderate oligozoospermia or moderate oligoasthenozoospermia need not be subjected to this procedure .",4
"Of the 854 patients who underwent randomization , 33 ( 3.9 % ) had a new diagnosis of occult cancer between randomization and the 1-year follow-up : 14 of the 431 patients ( 3.2 % ) in the limited-screening group and 19 of the 423 patients ( 4.5 % ) in the limited-screening-plus-CT group ( P = 0.28 ) .",3
"In the primary outcome analysis , 4 occult cancers ( 29 % ) were missed by the limited screening strategy , whereas 5 ( 26 % ) were missed by the strategy of limited screening plus CT ( P = 1.0 ) .",3
"There was no significant difference between the two study groups in the mean time to a cancer diagnosis ( 4.2 months in the limited-screening group and 4.0 months in the limited-screening-plus-CT group , P = 0.88 ) or in cancer-related mortality ( 1.4 % and 0.9 % , P = 0.75 ) .",3

"A total of 452 patients were randomly assigned 2:1 to treatment with O-SES ( 298 patients , 332 lesions ) or X-EES ( 154 patients , 173 lesions ) in a multicenter , noninferiority trial .",3
The primary end point was in-stent late loss at 9 months .,3
"O-SES was noninferior to X-EES for the primary end point ( 0.100.32 versus 0.110.29 mm ; difference = 0.00063 mm ; 95 % confidence interval , -0.06 to 0.07 ; Pnoninferiority < 0.0001 ) .",3

"A subgroup of patients ( n = 55 ) underwent serial optical coherence tomography at 9 months , which demonstrated similar neointimal thickness among lesions allocated to O-SES and X-EES ( 0.100.04 mm versus 0.110.04 mm ; -0.01 [ -0.04 , -0.01 ] ; P = 0.37 ) .",3
"Another subgroup of patients ( n = 56 ) underwent serial intravascular ultrasound at baseline and 9 months indicating a potential difference in neointimal area at follow-up ( O-SES , 0.160.33 mm ( 2 ) versus X-EES , 0.430.56 mm ( 2 ) ; P = 0.04 ) .",3
"Compared with durable polymer X-EES , novel biodegradable polymer-based O-SES was found noninferior for the primary end point in-stent late lumen loss at 9 months .",4
Clinical event rates were comparable without cases of stent thrombosis throughout 1 year of follow-up .,4
"Forty patients were included in this study , 20 cases in each group .",3
"For group patients , SVV was increased significantly along with blood volume reduction , and changes in CI were negatively correlated with changes in SVV ( r = -0.605 , P < 0.01 ) ; SVV decreased significantly along with correction of blood volume ; changes in CI were negatively correlated with changes in SVV ( r = -0.651 , P < 0.01 ) .",3
"For group patients , along with blood volume increase , SVV did not change significantly ; changes in CI revealed no significant correlation with changes in SVV ( r = 0.067 , P > 0.05 ) .",3
"SVV is a useful indicator for hypovolemia , but not for hypervolemia .",4
The MPM-treated group showed a statistically significant improvement in PD reduction and clinical attachment gain compared to the OM control group .,3
"Similarly , rIBD was significantly reduced in MPM-treated sites as compared with those of the OM group .",3
"BMP-2 concentrations peaked in the MPM samples obtained during the early postoperative period ( days 1 , 3 and 7 ) with a statistically significant difference compared with OM-treated groups .",3
"BMP-2 levels decreased sharply in the samples obtained at days 14 , 21 and 30 with non-significant higher levels in MPM samples as compared with those of OM sites .",3
"Within the limits of the present study , one can conclude that MPM coverage of periodontal defects is associated with a significant initial increase in GCF levels of BMP-2 , a factor that could improve the clinical outcomes of guided tissue regenerative surgery .",4
There was no statistically significant difference in postoperative peak troponin values or any of the secondary end-points .,3
"In the subgroup of acyanotic patients under 6 months , sevoflurane led to significantly lower postoperative troponin levels compared with midazolam [ reduction of 54 % ( 95 % confidence interval 29-71 % , P = 0.002 ) ] , without any differences in secondary outcome parameters .",3
Sevoflurane did not provide superior myocardial protection in our general paediatric cardiac surgical population .,4
"In children under 6 months , however , sevoflurane might be beneficial in comparison with midazolam .",4
The conditioning effects of sevoflurane in specific paediatric subgroups need to be further investigated .,4
"Significant increases in steps / day , weekly leisure-time activity score , self-efficacy , outcome expectations , and self-regulation , and reduced resting heart rate were observed at the end of the intervention .",3
"With the exception of resting heart rate , the intervention effects on these variables also remained at the follow-up .",3

"Morphine consumption during 0 to 24 h was lower in group IP versus group IV , mean difference -22.6 mg ( 95 % CI , 11.4 to 33.8 ; P < 0.01 ) .",3
No difference was seen between group IV and group P.,3
"The total mean plasma concentration of lidocaine in group IP was significantly lower than group IV , 0 to 4.5 h postoperatively ( P = 0.03 ) with no evidence of systemic toxicity .",3
Pain intensity and other recovery parameters were similar between the groups .,3
The lower supplemental morphine consumption and plasma lidocaine concentration in group IP would confirm that the effects of local anesthetics are likely to be predominant via local intraperitoneal receptors or anti-inflammatory effects and not via central mechanisms alone .,4
"The PI , RI and S/D in the group C and D were obviously lower than those in group A and B ( all P < 0.01 ) .",3
"The endometrial thickness was ( 7.7 + / - 1.49 ) mm in group B , ( 8.2 + / - 1.54 ) mm in group C and ( 8.9 + / - 1.51 ) mm in group D , which were significantly different from ( 6.4 5 + / - 1.26 ) mm in the group A ( all P < 0.01 ) also there was a significant difference between group C and D ( P < 0.05 ) .",3
"The rate of endometrial type A was 65.0 % in the group D , which was significantly higer than 27.5 % in the group A , 32.5 % in the group B and 35.0 % in the group C ( all P < 0.01 ) .",3
"The pregnancy rate was 30.0 % in the group D , which was obviously higher than 12.5 % in the group A , 15.0 % in the group B and 17.5 % in the group C ( P < 0.05 ) .",3
"The endometrial thickness and rate of endometrial type A in the pregnant were obviously higher than those in the non-pregnant ( both P < 0.01 ) while PI , RI and S/D was lower than those in the non-pregnant ( P < 0.01 , P < 0.05 ) .",3
"Warm needing combined with Zhangmo decoction could improve endometrial thickness , morphology and uterine spiral artery to improve pregnancy rate , which has superior effect to clomiphene , clomiphene combined with progynova and clomiphene combined with Zhangmo decoction .",4
Actigraphic data revealed good compliance with experimental sleep requirements .,3
"Induced night-wakings and sleep restriction both resulted in more OCPT omission and commission errors , and in increased depression , fatigue and confusion levels and reduced vigor compared to the normal sleep night .",3
"Moreover , there were no significant differences between the consequences of induced awakenings and sleep restriction .",3
"Our pilot study indicates that , similar to sleep restriction , one night of life-like repeated night-wakings negatively affects mood and sustained attention .",4
"Important features of this study include the randomization procedures , single-blind , large sample size , and a standardized protocol for whole body vibration in chronic low back pain .",4
This study aims to determine whether whole body vibration exercise produces more beneficial effects than general exercise for chronic low back pain .,4
"Therefore , our results will be useful for patients with chronic low back pain as well as for medical staff and health-care decision makers .",4
There were no significant differences between conditions posttrial on body composition outcomes using the adjusted critical value ( P < .008 ) .,3
"There was a significant effect of the intervention on whole-body BMC ( P = .04 , ( 2 ) < .001 ) and BMD ( P = .01 , ( 2 ) = .003 ) using the unadjusted critical value ( P < .05 ) .",3
"The effect of the intervention on percent body fat ( P = .09 , ( 2 ) = .001 ) and whole-body fat mass ( P = .05 , ( 2 ) = .003 ) approached significance using unadjusted criteria .",3
"There was not a significant effect on whole-body lean soft tissue ( P = .28 , ( 2 ) < .001 ) or body mass index ( P = .86 , ( 2 ) < .001 ) .",3
Our results provide preliminary evidence that an internet-delivered lifestyle physical activity intervention might improve bone health and body composition in MS. Such findings are important considering that physical activity is a modifiable behavior with the potential to confer long-term benefits for the prevention and management of fracture risk and comorbidities among those with MS.,4
This IVIST01-trial will answer the question whether the new concept of steering immunosuppressive and antiviral therapy by Tvis levels leads to better future graft function .,4
"In terms of an effect-related drug monitoring , the study design aims to realize a personalization of immunosuppressive and antiviral management after transplantation .",4
"Based on the IVIST01-trial , immunomonitoring by Tvis might be incorporated into routine care after kidney transplantation .",4
"At completion of training , improvements in exercise duration in the heliox and breathing-retraining groups were not significantly different .",3
"Compared to the exercise-training plus oxygen group , exercise duration improved more in the breathing-retraining group ( P = 0.008 ) but not in the heliox group ( P = 0.142 ) .",3
Hyperinflation was reduced with breathing-retraining plus oxygen compared to the other two groups .,3
"Six-weeks later , improvements in exercise duration were still greater with breathing-retraining than with exercise-training ( P = 0.015 ) .",3
"In contrast , improvements in exercise duration with heliox did not differ from those in the other two groups .",3
"In moderate-to-severe COPD , exercise-training combined with either heliox or with breathing-retraining yielded not significantly different improvements in exercise duration - with only the latter being superior to exercise-training .",4
"Six-weeks after training , these improvements were still greater after exercise-training plus breathing-retraining than after exercise-training .",4
HMGB1 expression and levels of sRAGE in TRALI patients did not differ from those in controls .,3
There was a trend towards higher S100A12 levels in TRALI patients compared to the controls .,3
"Furthermore , S100A12 levels were associated with increased levels of markers of pulmonary inflammation , prolonged cardiopulmonary bypass , hypoxemia and duration of mechanical ventilation .",3
No evidence was found that HMGB1 and sRAGE contribute to the development of TRALI .,4
"S100A12 is associated with duration of cardiopulmonary bypass , pulmonary inflammation , hypoxia and prolonged mechanical ventilation and may contribute to acute lung injury in cardiac surgery patients .",4
"The mean Cmax of triflusal and HTB were 13.96 , 110.2 ug/mL for the fasting state and 9.546 , 97.15 ug/mL for the fed state , respectively .",3
"The AUC0-144 of triflusal and HTB were 19.66 , 5,572 hxg/mL for the fasting state and 22.20 , 5,038 hxg/mL for the fed state , the AUC0 - of triflusal and HTB were 19.79 , 6,333 hxg/mL for the fasting state and 22.44 , 5,632 hxg/mL for the fed state , respectively .",3
"The results showed that Cmax and AUCs for triflusal were outside the bioequivalency ( BE ) interval after food intake , but there was no statistically significant change for HTB .",3
High-fat food intake may affect the pharmacokinetics of triflusal capsule in healthy subjects .,4
"Anxiety , disgust and physiological arousal habituated within each exposure stage , with no differential effect of real compared to hyper-real images .",3
Both treatment groups but not controls demonstrated significant reductions in behavioural avoidance and self-reported phobic symptoms from pre-treatment to post-treatment with large effect sizes noted .,3
"The change in within-stage habituation of anxiety , disgust and heart rate , between the first and last stage , predicted improvement in behavioural avoidance at post-treatment .",3
This suggests that generalisation of habituation to multiple images is an important predictor of improvement .,3
"While findings in relation to therapeutic outcome should be considered preliminary , clear relationships were found between exposure-related variables and outcome among those who undertook treatment .",4
Findings provide evidence in support of the efficacy of online image-based exposure and have implications for informing further research into the underlying mechanisms of image-based exposure treatment .,4
"On a day of active therapy , telmisartan significantly lowered both systolic and diastolic home BP in the morning to a greater extent compared to candesartan .",3
"At the end of the study , reductions in systolic and diastolic home BP in the morning , in telmisartan group were significantly larger compared to the changes in the candesartan group ( systolic ; Tel : 12.0 8.9 versus Can : 8.1 17.1 mmHg , p = 0.0292 , diastolic ; Tel : 7.4 6.1 versus Can : 3.7 6.8 mmHg , p = 0.0053 ) .",3
"Additionally in the telmisartan treated group , LDL-cholesterol showed significant reduction ( p = 0.037 ) , but candesartan did not .",3
"The present study by using the telemedicine system clearly demonstrated that telmisartan has a strong effect on reducing morning home BP , and a good effect on lipid metabolism in patients with metabolic syndrome .",4
The first mailing yielded a significant variation in response rates across groups ( ( 2 ) = 9.34 ; p = 0.025 ) .,3
Priority Mail ( 64.7 % ; p = 0.008 ) and Incentive & Priority Mail ( 63.6 % ; p = 0.016 ) groups had significantly higher response rates than Controls ( 52.9 % ) .,3
"After the second mailing , the overall response rate increased significantly from 59.6 % to 71.4 % ( p < 0.001 ) ; however , response rates no longer differed across groups ( range , 69.3 % [ Incentive group ] to 73.9 % [ Priority Mail group ] ) .",3
"Long-term prostate cancer survivors ' response rates to mailed surveys increased with the use of Priority Mail and a repeat survey mailing , but the unconditional gift certificate incentive was not supported in this population .",4
"By identifying and applying specialized survey methods , studies targeting survivors of prostate cancer and other geriatric cancers may improve response rates , thus limiting a source of potential bias .",4
"Patients from TEMPO and RADIUS II who received etanercept monotherapy showed similar CDAI remission rates ( 39 % and 35 % , respectively , at 3 years ) .",3
"Among patients who received etanercept with methotrexate , remission rates were 54 % and 36 % , respectively .",3
"Remission occurred more rapidly in TEMPO than RADIUS II perhaps from differences in compliance , patient populations , or sequence of combination therapy initiation .",3
"Generally , more patients with lower baseline CDAI scores achieved remission than those with higher scores .",3
Continued remission appeared more likely in patients achieving remission earlier in the course of their therapy ( 0-6 months ) .,3
"Remission by year 3 in etanercept-treated ( with and without methotrexate ) patients with RA occurred in 35 % of patients in both an RCT ( TEMPO ) and a clinical practice setting ( RADIUS II ) , and more frequently in those with lower baseline disease severity .",4
Patients with lower RA disease activity were more likely to reach remission .,4
Continued remission may be more likely in patients who achieved remission earlier .,4
There was a significant difference between the SaV and RECIST-based tumour volumes .,3
The same model showed no significant difference between the SaV and WHO-based volumes .,3
Scatter plots showed that the RECIST-based volumes overestimate lesion volume .,3
"The agreement between the SaV and WHO-based relative changes in tumour volume , evaluated by intraclass correlation , showed nearly perfect agreement .",3
"Estimating the volume of metastatic lesions using both the LD and LOD ( WHO ) is more accurate than those based on LD only ( RECIST ) , which overestimates lesion volume .",4
The good agreement between the SaV and WHO-based relative changes in tumour volume enables a reasonable approximation of three-dimensional tumour burden .,4
"Tumour response in patients undergoing chemotherapy is assessed using CT images Measurements are based on RECIST ( unidimensional ) - based or WHO ( bidimensional ) - based criteria We calculated tumour volume from bidimensional target lesion measurements This formula provides good tumour volume approximation , based on semiautomated volumetry .",4
There were no significant differences in the performance of either task following GVS ( relative to sham stimulation ) .,3
Galvanic vestibular stimulation did not reduce spatial neglect symptoms in any of the stimulation conditions .,4
Further studies are necessary to understand the disparity between our results and those reported in the literature .,4
"Repeated sessions , a higher current intensity and/or alternating-current stimulation may improve this method before it can be used clinically .",4
"At week 4 and 8 after treatment serum TG decreased by 26.69 % and 33.29 % respectively in the A group ( both P < 0.01 ) , while it was decreased by 25.7 % and 22.98 % respectively in the B group ( both P < 0.01 ) .",3
At week 8 decreased serum TG was obviously higher in the A group than in the B group ( P < 0.05 ) .,3
"Compared with before treatment , serum levels of LDL-C and TC levels decreased significantly in the two groups ( all P < 0.01 ) .",3
There was no statistical difference in the drop-out value and the drop-out rate of serum LDL-C and TC levels ( P > 0.05 ) .,3
At week 8 the serum HDL-C level showed an increasing tendency in the two groups .,3
No obvious increase in peptase or creatase occurred in the two groups after treatment .,3
JTSC combined with ACT could lower the serum TG level of combined hyperlipidemia patients with safety .,4
The primary endpoint is the composite of recurrent ischemic lesion and intracranial bleeding on MRI at four-weeks .,3
"Secondary endpoints are recurrent ischemic lesions , intracranial bleeding , major bleeding , major vascular events , four-week modified Rankin Scale score , and duration of hospitalization after randomization .",3
The results of this proof-of-concept trial will guide go/no-go decision to a large phase 3 confirmatory trial .,4
"After 12 weeks of administration , there was no significant change in mean serum levels of ALT ( P = .42 ) or AST ( P = .20 ) or other biomarkers in any group , and no significant differences were observed among groups .",3
Most adverse events were mild ; gastrointestinal disorders occurred more frequently in the ASP9831 groups than the placebo group .,3
"Despite a relevant mechanism of action , ASP9831 did not significantly alter the biochemical markers of NASH , compared with placebo , in a clinical trial .",4
This highlights the difficulties of developing therapeutics for NASH and the need for more extensive preclinical testing of mechanisms of potential drug candidates .,4
Clinicaltrialsregister.eu : 2005-001687-31 ; EudraCT numbers : 2007-002114-19 .,4
A total of 31 patients were included .,3
"No difference appeared between groups for quality of life , overactive bladder and frequency of urgency episodes ( respectively P = 0.197 , P = 0.532 et P = 0.788 ) .",3
"These parameters were significantly improved in pelvic floor muscle training group ( n = 16 ) ( respectively P = 0.004 , P = 0.002 et P = 0.006 ) and in transcutaneous posterior tibial nerve stimulation group ( n = 15 ) ( respectively P = 0.001 , P = 0.001 et P = 0.031 ) .",3
Pelvic floor muscle training and transcutaneous posterior tibial nerve stimulation improved in the same way symptoms related to urgency in MS patients with mild disability .,4
"The total mean ( SE ) carotenoid AUC0-10h in TRL was higher for the HE meal than for LE and control meals [ 125.7 19.4 ( a ) compared with 44.8 9.2 ( b ) compared with 14.9 5.2 ( b ) nmol/L 10 h , respectively ( values without a common superscript letter differ ) ; P < 0.0001 ] .",3
"The TRL AUC ( 0-10h ) of lutein and zeaxanthin increased 4-5-fold ( P < 0.001 ) , and the TRL AUC ( 0-10h ) of carotenoid not present in eggs , including - carotene , - carotene , and lycopene , increased 3-8-fold ( P < 0.01 ) for the HE meal compared with the control meal .",3
These findings support the claim that co-consuming cooked whole eggs is an effective way to enhance carotenoid absorption from other carotenoid-rich foods such as a raw mixed-vegetable salad .,4
This trial was registered at clinicaltrials.gov as NCT01951313 .,4
"Patients in the TRA group showed higher VAS scores than those in TFA group after catheterization [ CAG alone , 3 ( 2-5 ) vs. 1 ( 1-3 ) , p < 0.0001 ; PCI , 4 ( 2-6 ) vs. 2 ( 1-3 ) , p < 0.0001 , respectively ] .",3
"One month later , patients in TRA group also showed higher VAS scores than those in TFA group [ CAG alone , 1 ( 0-1 ) vs. 0 ( 0-1 ) , p < 0.0001 ; PCI , 1 ( 0-2 ) vs. 0 ( 0-1 ) , p < 0.0001 , respectively ] .",3
"By the ROC analysis in TRA group , a level of BMI < 24.3 kg/m2 predicted unacceptable pain with a 87.3 % sensitivity and 91.6 % specificity [ area under curve ( AUC ) : 0.875 , 95 % CI : 0.839-0 .906 , p < 0.0001 ] , while a wrist circumference < 16.7 cm predicted unacceptable pain with 84.6 % sensitivity and 89.8 % specificity ( AUC : 0.900 , 95 % CI : 0.867-0 .928 , p < 0.0001 ) .",3
The current study suggests that a radial approach for CAG and PCI in patients with a low BMI and small wrist circumference may cause more access site pain as compared with a femoral approach .,4
"For patients randomized to carotid stenting , there was no significant temporal change in the unadjusted composite rates that declined from 6.2 % in the first period , to 4.9 % in the second , and 4.6 % in the third ( P = 0.28 ) .",3
"Adjustment for patient characteristics attenuated the rates to 6.0 % , 5.9 % , and 5.6 % ( P = 0.85 ) .",3
"For carotid endarterectomy-randomized patients , both the composite and the combined stroke and death outcome decreased between periods 1 and 2 and then increased in period 3 .",3
The hypothesized temporal reduction of stroke + death events for carotid stenting-treated patients was not observed .,4
"Further adjustment for changes in patient characteristics between periods , including the addition of asymptomatic patients and a > 50 % decrease in proportion of octogenarians enrolled , resulted in practically identical rates .",4
"No standard extreme responding variables ( e.g. , an index of total extreme responding ) predicted symptom return , but higher relative levels of style ER-P predicted relapse/recurrence .",3
Total DAS scores also predicted relapse/recurrence but only when high levels of style ER-P responses were controlled .,3
"ER-Ps , at least on the DAS , appear to contain indicators of both adaptive and maladaptive positive responses .",4
"Future research should attend to the valence of the extreme responses as well as to the content of extreme positive responses , which may reflect either healthy or unhealthy tendencies .",4
Retention rates were good for both groups : 80.4 % ( 111/138 ) for the program group and 94.3 % ( 132/140 ) for the control group .,3
"Program group participants spent a mean of 102.26 minutes in the program ( SD 148.32 ) , logged in a mean of 4.33 times ( SD 4.28 ) , and viewed a mean of 11.04 pages ( SD 20.08 ) .",3
"In the analysis of the imputed dataset , the program group performed significantly better than the control group on diet behavioral change self-efficacy ( estimated adjusted difference [ ] = 0.16 , P = .048 ) , planning healthy eating ( = 0.17 , P = .03 ) , and mild exercise ( = 1.03 , P = .01 ) .",3
Moderator and dosage analyses of the dataset found no significant program effects .,3
"Analyses of the nonimputed dataset comparing program users with controls found additional significant program effects on eating practices ( = 0.09 , P = .03 ) , exercise self-efficacy ( = 0.12 , P = .03 ) , exercise planning ( = 0.18 , P = .03 ) , and aging beliefs ( = 0.17 , P = .01 ) .",3
Moderator analysis of this dataset also found significant moderator effects of gender on multiple measures of exercise .,3
A Web-based health promotion program showed promise for making a significant contribution to the short-term dietary and exercise practices of older working adults .,4
Gender effects suggest that the program effects on exercise are due mainly to improvements among women .,4
"Among patients with baseline SPARCC scores , 40 % had an SI joint score of 2 and 52 % had a spine score of 2 .",3
"Forty-nine percent of patients with baseline SI joint scores of < 2 , and 58 % of those with baseline SI joint scores of 2 , had a spine score of 2 .",3
"Comparison of baseline disease characteristics by baseline SI joint and spine scores showed that a greater proportion of patients in the subgroup with a baseline SPARCC score of 2 for both SI joints and spine were male , and patients with spine and SI joint scores of < 2 were younger and had shorter symptom duration .",3
"SPARCC spine scores correlated with baseline symptom duration , and SI joint scores correlated negatively with the baseline Bath Ankylosing Spondylitis Disease Activity Index , but neither correlated with the baseline Ankylosing Spondylitis Disease Activity Score , total back pain , the patient 's global assessment of disease activity , the Bath Ankylosing Spondylitis Functional Index , morning stiffness , nocturnal pain , or C-reactive protein level .",3
Assessment by experienced readers showed that spinal inflammation on MRI might be observed in half of patients with nonradiographic axial SpA without SI joint inflammation .,4
"For both stimuli , mean TSS was significantly decreased in the VXT and Gluma groups at all time points ( all , P < 0.001 ) compared with baseline .",3
"Regarding comparisons of TSS between treatment groups , the VXT group had significantly lower mean TSS compared with the Gluma group ( P < 0.05 ) and placebo control group ( P < 0.05 ) at all time points after treatment regardless of stimuli .",3
"Group Effect , Time Effect , and Group x Time Effect were all significantly different ( all , P < 0.001 ) .",3
The mean follow-up time was 36.94.8 months .,3
Postoperative 3-dimensional computed tomography scans showed that bone sockets were variable on both femoral and tibial sides in the EF group and almost consistent in the BL group .,3
All of the evaluation indexes were significantly improved postoperatively in both groups .,3
There were no revision cases in the EF group and 2 in the BL group .,3
The EF group showed a faster range of motion ( ROM ) recovery ( at 0 to 120 ) than did the BL group .,3
"At final follow-up , there was no significant difference between the EF and BL groups in Tegner score ( 5.881.39 vs 5.161.76 ; P = .058 ) or pivot-shift test ( 34 vs 32 ; P = .067 ) .",3
"The EF group had a larger proportion of patients with IKDC grade A ( normal ) ( 33 vs 24 ; P < .020 ) , smaller side-to-side difference ( 0.680.38 mm vs 1.230.61 mm ; P < .001 ) , higher Lysholm score ( 91.294.90 vs 88.715.09 ; P = .032 ) , and better second-look arthroscopic evaluations for graft quality in the anteromedial ( P = .034 ) , posterolateral ( P = .015 ) , and combined bundles ( P = .029 ) compared with the BL group .",3
"Although both techniques provided satisfactory clinical results , DB-ACLR using the existing footprint remnant for tunnel placement showed better functional results with respect to faster ROM recovery , higher subjective outcome scores , and better arthroscopic second-look with no revision cases .",4
"Blood concentrations of a number of micronutrients increased significantly in the micronutrient supplement group , indicating excellent compliance with the intervention .",3
"There was no significant difference in mean LVEF at 12 months between treatment groups after adjusting for baseline ( mean difference : 1.6 % , 95 % confidence interval : -2.6 to 5.8 , p = 0.441 ) .",3
There was also no significant difference in any of the secondary endpoints at 12 months between treatment groups .,3

At delivery women randomized to metformin had lower insulin concentrations than those randomized to placebo ( 259209 vs 361261pmol/l ; P = 0.020 ) .,3
No difference was found in insulin concentrations in umbilical venous ( P = 0.95 ) and arterial ( P = 0.39 ) blood between the metformin and placebo groups .,3
The arteriovenous difference was also equal between the groups ( P = 0.38 ) .,3
Insulin concentrations were higher in the umbilical vein than in the umbilical artery independent of randomization ( 7051 vs 4548pmol/l ; P < 0.0005 ) .,3
"In PCOS , metformin treatment during pregnancy resulted in lower maternal insulin concentrations at delivery .",4
Metformin treatment did not affect fetal insulin concentrations .,4
Higher insulin concentrations in the umbilical vein indicate that the placenta somehow secretes insulin to the fetus .,4
The possibility of placental insulin secretion to the fetus deserves further investigations .,4
Sequential therapy was found to be associated with a higher initial material cost for induction and maintenance .,3
"The average effectiveness for the patients treated with therapy with BCG alone was 4.39 years with a mean cost of $ 9236 ( 95 % confidence interval , $ 9118 - $ 9345 ) per patient .",3
"The sequential group resulted in an average effectiveness of 4.65 years , with a mean cost of $ 16,468 ( 95 % confidence interval , $ 16,371 - $ 16,527 ) .",3
"The 5-year incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of sequential versus BCG-alone therapy was $ 27,815 per life-year gained .",3
The corresponding figure over a 10-year period was $ 8618 per life-year gained .,3
The results of the current study suggest that sequential therapy is a cost-effective treatment for patients with high-risk non-muscle-invasive bladder cancer .,4
Statistically significant improvements were found in the mean corrected count increment when comparing cross-match-compatible platelets with randomly selected and incompatible platelets ( p < 0.001 for each ) .,3
Compatible platelet transfusions were associated with a good response in 72.9 % of cases while incompatible platelets were associated with a poor response in 66.7 % of transfusion events ( p < 0.001 ) .,3
"In the presence of clinical factors or alloimmunisation , compatible platelets were associated with good responses in 67.9 % and 28.0 % respectively vs 100 % and 93.3 % in their absence ( p = 0.009 , p < 0.001 ) .",3
"Multivariate analysis revealed that cross-matching and alloimmunisation were the strongest predictors of transfusion response at 1 hour , while ABO compatibility , type of units received , followed by alloimmunisation then clinical factors were predictors at 24 hours .",3
Platelet cross-matching using the solid-phase red cell adherence technique is an effective and rapid first-line approach for the management of patients refractory to platelet transfusions .,4
"Baseline mean angular measurements of PST and IR for all athletes involved in the study were 6214 and 4010 , respectively , with no significant difference between groups ( P = .598 and P = .734 , respectively ) .",3
"Mean PST measurements were significantly different between groups after the horizontal adduction stretch , with a mean angle of 8317 among the scapular stabilization group and 6513 among the nonstabilization group ( P < .001 ) .",3
"Measurements of IR were also significantly different between groups , with a mean angle of 5114 among the scapular stabilization group and 439 among the nonstabilization group ( P = .006 ) .",3
Horizontal adduction stretches performed with scapular stabilization produced significantly greater improvements in IR and PST than horizontal adduction stretching without scapular stabilization .,4
"Of the 1600 enrolled patients , 796 were assigned to the EGDT group and 804 to the usual-care group .",3
Primary outcome data were available for more than 99 % of the patients .,3
"Patients in the EGDT group received a larger mean ( SD ) volume of intravenous fluids in the first 6 hours after randomization than did those in the usual-care group ( 19641415 ml vs. 17131401 ml ) and were more likely to receive vasopressor infusions ( 66.6 % vs. 57.8 % ) , red-cell transfusions ( 13.6 % vs. 7.0 % ) , and dobutamine ( 15.4 % vs. 2.6 % ) ( P < 0.001 for all comparisons ) .",3
"At 90 days after randomization , 147 deaths had occurred in the EGDT group and 150 had occurred in the usual-care group , for rates of death of 18.6 % and 18.8 % , respectively ( absolute risk difference with EGDT vs. usual care , -0.3 percentage points ; 95 % confidence interval , -4.1 to 3.6 ; P = 0.90 ) .",3
"There was no significant difference in survival time , in-hospital mortality , duration of organ support , or length of hospital stay .",3

Cyclops lesions were found in 15 of the 55 knees ( 27.3 % ) on second-look arthroscopy ( cyclops group ) .,3
Only 6 of the 55 knees ( 10.9 % ) had extension loss ( cyclops syndrome ) .,3
The cyclops group included 3 men and 12 women .,3
The two groups showed a statistical difference in sex variation ( P = 0.04 ) .,3
No significant differences were found in the femoral and tibial tunnel sizes between the two groups .,3
The cross-sectional area of the femoral intercondylar notch was significantly smaller in the cyclops group ( 251.763.2 mm ( 2 ) ) than in the no-cyclops group ( 335.677.6 mm ( 2 ) ) ( P < 0.001 ) .,3
The percentage of the total femoral tunnel size to the cross-sectional area of the femoral intercondylar notch was significantly higher in the cyclops group ( 18.65.3 % ) than in the no-cyclops group ( 13.23.6 % ) ( P = 0.02 ) .,3
A smaller intercondylar notch size may be a potential risk factor for cyclops lesion formation .,4
"Whole-body glucose counterregulation , the difference in glucose infusion rates required to maintain the glycaemic goal between the hypoglycaemic and euglycaemic clamps , was improved in T1DM/ITx ( + ) ( 7.81.3 mol kg ( -1 ) min ( -1 ) ) compared with T1DM/ITx ( - ) ( 0.30.9 mol kg ( -1 ) min ( -1 ) ) , but was ~ 45 % lower than in controls ( 14.12.1 mol kg ( -1 ) min ( -1 ) ) .",3
"Increased endogenous glucose production ( EGP ) and decreased systemic glucose disposal accounted for 49 % and 39 % of glucose counterregulation in T1DM/ITx ( + ) , respectively , compared with 60 % and 36 % in controls .",3
"Lactate GN increased in T1DM/ITx ( + ) ( 2.70.4 mol kg ( -1 ) min ( -1 ) ) and controls ( 1.70.5 mol kg ( -1 ) min ( -1 ) ) , such that it accounted for 70 % and 20 % of the increased EGP , respectively .",3
Skeletal muscle accounted for similar proportions of the decrease in systemic glucose disposal in controls ( 49 % ) and T1DM/ITx ( + ) ( 41 % ) .,3
"Partial islet graft function improves hypoglycaemia counterregulation by increasing EGP , largely via lactate GN and decreasing systemic glucose disposal .",4
This may explain the reduction in severe hypoglycaemic events in T1DM/ITx ( + ) individuals .,4
"Consumption of BC30 significantly increased populations of Faecalibacterium prausnitzii by 0.1 log10 cells/mL more than during consumption of the placebo ( P = 0.03 ) , whereas populations of Bacillus spp .",3
increased significantly by 0.5 log10 cells/mL from baseline in volunteers who consumed BC30 ( P = 0.007 ) .,3
"LPS-stimulated PBMCs showed a 0.2 ng/mL increase in the anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10 28 d after consumption of BC30 ( P < 0.05 ) , whereas the placebo did not affect IL-10 , and no overall difference was found in the effect of the treatments .",3
Daily consumption of BC30 by adults aged 65-80 y can increase beneficial groups of bacteria in the human gut and potentially increase production of anti-inflammatory cytokines .,4

"Two hundred seventy-one subjects completed the trial , 90 receiving propofol , 85 receiving 1:1 propofol and ketamine , and 96 receiving 4:1 propofol and ketamine .",3
"Airway or respiratory adverse events leading to an intervention were similar between groups : 29 % , 19 % , and 32 % , respectively ( P = .21 ) .",3
There were no serious adverse events in any group .,3
"Secondary outcomes were generally similar between groups , with greater recovery agitation observed in the 1:1 ketofol group ( 8 % , 21 % , and 10 % , respectively ) .",3
We found a similar frequency of airway and respiratory adverse events leading to intervention between propofol alone and either 1:1 or 4:1 ketofol .,4
"There was significant improvement in urinary symptoms in the intervention group , especially in the first 5 weeks .",3
"Compared with the control group , participants receiving the intervention showed significant reduction in urinary incontinence episodes per week with a mean difference of -6.4 ( 95 % confidence interval , -8.9 to -3.9 ; t = -5.3 ; P < 0.001 ) and significant improvement of quality of life with a mean difference of -3.93 ( 95 % confidence interval , -5.08 to -2.78 ; t = -6.9 ; P < 0.001 ) measured by Incontinence Impact Questionnaire Short Form modified Chinese ( Taiwan ) version .",3
"The subjective perception of improvement , measured by an 11-point visual analogue scale , was markedly better in the intervention group ( mean , 8.7 ; standard deviation , 1.0 ; 95 % confidence interval , 8.4-9 .1 ) than in the control group ( mean , 1.4 ; standard deviation , 0.7 ; 95 % confidence interval , 1.2-1 .7 ; t = 33.9 ; P < 0.001 ) .",3
"The mean treatment satisfaction in the intervention group was 9.5 ( standard deviation , 0.8 ) as measured by an 11-point visual analogue scale .",3

Three hundred six eligible women were enrolled ( recruitment rate = 64 % ) ; 204 completed the 6-month follow-up ( completion rate = 67 % ) .,3
Depressive symptoms decreased to a greater extent in MI than referral women ( P = .07 ) .,3
"Self-efficacy and stage-of-readiness-to-change increased more in MI than referral women , but these differences were not statistically significant .",3
"With a lower than projected sample size , our findings did not achieve statistical significance at the 5 % level but suggest a beneficial effect of the MI intervention on reducing depressive symptoms .",4
The groups were comparable at baseline .,3
"There was no difference in self-reported dysmenorrhoea at 12 months ( mean 0.8 [ SD 1.6 ] versus 0.8 [ SD 2.0 ] , P = 0.94 ) .",3
"There was no difference in patient satisfaction ( mean 9.3 [ SD 1.5 ] versus 9.1 [ SD 1.2 ] , P = 0.66 ) or quality of life ( mean 81.6 [ SD 17.8 ] versus 80.2 [ SD 18.0 ] , P = 0.69 ) .",3
Improvement in dysmenorrhoea and quality of life as well as patient satisfaction were comparable in the medium term when comparing total laparoscopic hysterectomy with laparoscopic supracervical hysterectomy .,4
"Mean EBC nitrite and the sum of nitrite and nitrate were increased from baseline at immediately post-exposure comparing unfiltered to filtered rides ( 2.11 M vs 1.70 M , p = 0.02 and 19.1 M vs 10.0 M , p = 0.02 , respectively ) .",3
"Mean EBC malondialdehyde ( MDA ) concentrations were about 10 % greater following the unfiltered vs. filtered exposures , although this result was not statistically significant .",3

"At immediately post-exposure , an interquartile range increase in particle number concentration was associated with statistically significant increases in nitrite ( 99.4 % , 95 % CI 32.1 % to 166.7 % ) and nitrite + nitrate ( 75.7 % , 95 % CI 21.5 % to 130.0 % ) .",3
Increases in markers of oxidative stress in EBC may represent early biological responses to widespread exposures to TRAPs particles that affect passengers in vehicles on heavily trafficked roadways .,4
No significant differences were recorded in the baseline clinical characteristics of ONCAB and OPCAB groups .,3
"A statistical difference was found between the two groups at the time of extubation , intensive care unit stay , hospital stay , blood requirements , incidence of intra-aortic balloon pump support , pulmonary complications , stroke , reoperation for bleeding , and inotropic requirements > 24 hours ( P < .05 ) .",3
"The number of anastomoses performed per patient , the incidence of postoperative ventricular arrhythmia , myocardial infarction , new-onset atrial fibrillation , hemodialysis , infective complications , recurrent angina , and percutaneous reintervention were similar between the 2 groups ( P > .05 ) .",3
The left ventricular end-diastolic dimension was significantly smaller at 6 months ' follow-up in the 2 groups than it was before operation ( < .05 ) .,3
No differences in hospital mortality and mid-term mortality between OPCAB and ONCAB groups were found .,3
"During the follow-up , no patient in either group had undergone repeat coronary artery bypass grafting .",3
No differences in early and mid-term mortality were found between OPCAB and ONCAB in patients with triple-vessel disease and enlarged ventricles .,4

"Both panels more frequently assessed the unoperated canine to have a better appearance than the contralateral operated canine ; however , there were no differences between the closed and open groups ( proportion preferring unoperated canine-laypeople : closed , 58.7 % ; open , 57.0 % ; P = 0.43 ; and orthodontists : closed , 60.9 % ; open , 60.6 % ; P = 0.27 ) .",3
"There is an esthetic impact to aligning a palatally displaced canine , but it is mostly minor and unlikely to be detectable by laypeople .",4
"The esthetic impact was the same , whether the canine was exposed with a closed or an open surgical technique .",4
No positive effect of training on WMC was found .,3
"In addition , the results show that a WM training was not associated with a reduction of rumination , depression , nor anxiety .",3
The high drop-out rate in both groups ( 20.11 % from pre - to post-training ) and the overrepresentation of men and use of anti-depressants in the placebo group might have influenced the results .,4
"Furthermore , expectations and perceptions about the training might have interacted with performance on WM tasks .",4
"Overall , results show that a stand-alone WM training in patients with symptoms of anxiety and/or depression does not result in reduced rumination nor in reduced symptoms of depression and anxiety .",4
We discuss potential explanations for these findings .,4
Fifteen patients fulfilling inclusion and exclusion criteria completed the study .,3
( - ) - OSU6162 was well tolerated by all patients and no adverse effects were observed .,3
"( - ) - OSU6162 treatment significantly improved the Short Form 36 Vitality score , mainly due to an improvement of the individual item ` worn-out ' ( VT3 ) .",3
"In addition , an improvement of depressive symptoms was found using Beck Depression Inventory .",3
In contrast to a general trend of improvement in several non-motor variables only small and non-significant differences between ( - ) - OSU6162 and placebo were found regarding motor functions .,3
"( - ) - OSU6162 offers promise for the treatment of HD , as a drug with good tolerability , capable of improving the patients ' experienced non-motor functions such as energy and mood and thus alleviating symptoms of great importance for their quality of life .",4
"Baseline NfL levels were higher in iSCI ( 21pg/mL ) and cSCI ( 70pg/mL ) than in HC ( 5pg/mL , p = 0.006 and p < 0.001 ) and CCS ( 6pg/mL , p = 0.025 and p = 0.010 ) .",3
Levels increased over time ( p < 0.001 ) and remained higher in cSCI versus iSCI ( p = 0.011 ) and than in CCS ( p < 0.001 ) .,3
"NfL levels correlated with American Spinal Injury Association ( ASIA ) motor score at baseline ( r = -0.53 , p = 0.004 ) and after 24h ( r = -0.69 , p < 0.001 ) and 3-12-month motor outcome ( baseline NfL : r = -0.43 , p = 0.026 and 24h NfL : r = -0.72 , p < 0.001 ) .",3
Minocycline treatment showed decreased NfL levels in the subgroup of cSCI patients .,3
Serum NfL concentrations in SCI patients show a close correlation with acute severity and neurological outcome .,4
Our data provide evidence that serum NfL is of prognostic value in SCI patients for the first time .,4

The intervention group showed a significant decrease in pain scores compared to the control group .,3
The rate of satisfaction was higher in the intervention group ( 79 % ) compared to the control group ( 25 % ) .,3
There was no significant difference for the Roland-Morris disability questionnaire score and the EQ-VAS scale .,3
The results of this clinical trial suggest that wearing unstable shoes for 6 weeks significantly decreases low back pain in patients suffering from chronic low back pain but had no significant effect on quality of life and disability scores .,4
"Intensive glycemic control had no appreciable effect on highly sensitive C-reactive protein , interleukin ( IL ) -6 , tumor necrosis factor alpha , IL-1 , or IL-10 levels at all time points after transplantation .",3
"Moreover , neither inflammatory biomarkers nor increased glycemic variability were associated with graft rejection .",3
"However , intensive treatment increased the risk of hypoglycemia ( BG < 70 mg/dL , 84 % vs. 25 % , P < 0.001 ) .",3
"In sub-analysis , compared to non-rejecters , rejecters demonstrated higher rates of blood glucose below 70 mg/dL ( 90 % vs. 49 % , P = 0.02 ) .",3
"Inflammatory biomarkers and increased glycemic variability lack correlation with clinical outcomes in renal transplant , but importantly , increased perioperative hypoglycemic episodes ( BG < 70mg/dL ) may be a salient etiology that contributed to the increased risk for acute allograft rejection related to intensive glycemic control .",4
Further research is needed to confirm a causal association .,4
There were 195 patients in RIDE/RISE who were treated with ranibizumab with a baseline HbA1c 7 % and 288 patients with a baseline HbA1c > 7 % included in this analysis .,3
The mean improvement in visual acuity ( VA ) at 36 months was +13 Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study ( ETDRS ) letters in patients with baseline HbA1c 7 % compared with +11 ETDRS letters in the patients with a baseline HbA1c > 7 % ( P = 0.17 ) .,3

"The corresponding differences in LVESV were +7.4 , +9.9 , and +13.1 mL , respectively ( all P < 0.001 ) .",3
The deleterious effects of RVA pacing consistently occurred in all the pre-defined subgroups .,3
"Furthermore , patients with RVA pacing had a significantly higher prevalence of heart failure hospitalization than the BiV group ( 23.9 % vs. 14.6 % , log-rank = 7.55 , P = 0.006 ) .",3
Left ventricular adverse remodelling and deterioration of systolic function continued at long-term follow-up in patients with RVA pacing ; this deterioration was prevented by the use of BiV pacing .,4
"Also , heart failure hospitalization was more prevalent in the RVA pacing group .",4
"Ramelteon was associated with a lower risk of delirium ( 3 % vs 32 % ; P = .003 ) , with a relative risk of 0.09 ( 95 % CI , 0.01-0 .69 ) .",3

"The Kaplan-Meier estimates of time to development of delirium were 6.94 ( 95 % CI , 6.82-7 .06 ) days for ramelteon and 5.74 ( 5.05-6 .42 ) days for placebo .",3
Comparison by log-rank test showed that the frequency of delirium was significantly lower in patients taking ramelteon than in those taking placebo ( ( 2 ) = 9.83 ; P = .002 ) .,3
Ramelteon administered nightly to elderly patients admitted for acute care may provide protection against delirium .,4
This finding supports a possible pathogenic role of melatonin neurotransmission in delirium .,4
sfRB and water + caffeine both increased REE to the same degree ( +4 % ) .,3
"Additionally , sfRB briefly increased RQ .",3
Water + caffeine had no effect on RQ relative to water + placebo .,3
sfRB enhanced thermogenesis and marginally shifted RQ to favor carbohydrate oxidation .,4
"The stimulatory effects of sfRB on REE are mimicked by water + caffeine , indicating that the auxiliary ingredients do not influence this thermic effect .",4
The metabolic effects of sfRB are primarily due to caffeine alone .,4

No patients developed a need for dialysis .,3
Mean hydration costs per patient were 224 for the sodium bicarbonate and 683 for the saline regime ( P < 0.001 ) .,3
Other healthcare costs were similar .,3
Short hydration with sodium bicarbonate prior to CE-CT was non-inferior to peri-procedural saline hydration with respect to renal safety and may result in healthcare savings .,4

Some strategies were more successful than others and they differed in the resources required .,3
"Actions that facilitated recruitment included increasing recruiting centres to 23 UK and two international hospitals , good centre support , using processes embedded in clinical practice , and good communication between the trial office , collaborators and participants .",3
"Collaborator incentives , whereby staff involved received the benefit immediately , were more successful than a nominal monetary payment per woman randomised .",3
"Barriers to recruitment included fewer eligible women than anticipated , patient 's preference to receive active treatment rather than allocation to the control group , lack of support staff and high staff turnover .",3
Geographical variations in Primary Care Trust Research Management and Governance approval systems and general practitioner ( GP ) referral procedures also impacted negatively on recruitment .,3

Effective interventions included increasing the number of recruiting centres and providing collaborator incentives .,4
"Barriers to recruitment included fewer eligible women than anticipated , patient 's preference to be allocated to the treatment group , lack of support staff , and variations in approval systems and GP referral procedures .",4
"To improve the evidence base on clinical trial recruitment , trialists need to publish their experiences and lessons learned .",4
"Future RCTs should evaluate , where possible , the effect of strategies designed to improve recruitment and retention .",4
The present manuscript provides details on the study design and methodology of a large school-based smoking prevention trial in a metropolitan area in Germany .,4
"Findings from this study will yield important insight into the long-term effectiveness of specific smoking prevention strategies , also in disadvantaged population groups .",4
"Patients ' ratings of treatment expectancy , credibility and therapeutic alliance were not found to have significant power for classifying patients into CST or sham group ( p. 05 ) .",3
"Only satisfaction with treatment revealed a significant impact ( AOR : 6.83 ; 95 % CI : [ 1.54 | 30.24 ] ; p = .011 ) in the non-imputed analysis , but not in the multiple imputation analysis ( AOR : 4.09 ; 95 % CI : [ 0.94 | 17.76 ] ; p = .060 ) .",3
Compliance of both groups was not significantly different ( p > .05 ) as were reasons for non-attendance .,3
No serious adverse events were reported .,3
"Patients ' expectancy , credibility and therapeutic alliance did not appear to affect study outcomes , blinding patients to group allocation was possible , and sham intervention was tolerable and safe .",4
The design can therefore be recommended as control for non-specific treatment effects in future CST clinical trials .,4
The mortality rate was 13.33 % vs. 55.56 % in the treatment and control ( P < 0.01 ) .,3
The patients whose Child-Pugh score decreased by more than 2 were 89.2 % vs. 62.3 % ( P < 0.05 ) .,3
"After treatment the serum ALT TBIL levels dropped , the serum albumin level increased and The improvement of liver function in the treatment group was better than that in the control group ( P < 0.01 ) .",3
The HBeAg and HBV-DNA negutive rate in the treatment group were higher than those in the control ( P < 0.01 ) .,3
The HBV-DNA negative rate in thetreatment group was 93.3 % at the end of 12 weekes .,3
"The rate of YMDD mutations was 6.7 % , 23.3 % and 40 % in the treatment group at the end of 48 , 96 and 144 weeks .",3
LVD and ADV can inhibit virus replication and the relative stability liver function remained the same in most YMDD mutation patients .,3
"LVD can inhibit virus replication rapidly and improveliver function , prevent exacerbation in patients with advanced schistosomiasis with chronic B hepatitis , LVD and ADV can inhibit virus replication and improve liver function in most YMDD mutation patients .",4
The mean SD of EDSS score was significantly decreased in both groups over the six months of the study ( 2.3 0.7 vs. 1.6 0.6 for the riboflavin group and 2.8 1.1 vs. 2.3 1.3 for the placebo groups .,3
"The comparison across both groups yielded a non-significant change ( P = 0.001 and 0.02 , respectively ) .",3
"No significant differences were observed between the two groups in terms of EGRAC , riboflavin deficiency levels by EGRAC category , and serum homocysteine levels before and after the study .",3
Riboflavin supplementation ( 10 mg/day ) to patients with MS does not improve disability status .,4
It appears that this effect is not related to serum homocysteine levels .,4
"Between Dec 18 , 2006 , and Feb 16 , 2009 , 1528 women were enrolled and randomly assigned to receive chemotherapy ( n = 764 ) or chemotherapy plus bevacizumab ( n = 764 ) .",3
"Median follow-up at the end of the trial on March 31 , 2013 , was 489 months ( IQR 266-562 ) , at which point 714 patients had died ( 352 in the chemotherapy group and 362 in the bevacizumab group ) .",3
"Our results showed evidence of non-proportional hazards , so we used the difference in restricted mean survival time as the primary estimate of effect .",3
No overall survival benefit of bevacizumab was recorded ( restricted mean survival time 446 months [ 95 % CI 432-459 ] in the standard chemotherapy group vs 455 months [ 442-467 ] in the bevacizumab group ; log-rank p = 085 ) .,3
"In an exploratory analysis of a predefined subgroup of 502 patients with poor prognosis disease , 332 ( 66 % ) died ( 174 in the standard chemotherapy group and 158 in the bevacizumab group ) , and a significant difference in overall survival was noted between women who received bevacizumab plus chemotherapy and those who received chemotherapy alone ( restricted mean survival time 345 months [ 95 % CI 320-370 ] with standard chemotherapy vs 393 months [ 370-417 ] with bevacizumab ; log-rank p = 003 ) .",3
"However , in non-high-risk patients , the restricted mean survival time did not differ significantly between the two treatment groups ( 497 months [ 95 % CI 483-511 ] ) in the standard chemotherapy group vs 484 months [ 470-499 ] in the bevacizumab group ; p = 020 ) .",3
An updated analysis of progression-free survival showed no difference between treatment groups .,3
"During extended follow-up , one further treatment-related grade 3 event ( gastrointestinal fistula in a bevacizumab-treated patient ) , three grade 2 treatment-related events ( cardiac failure , sarcoidosis , and foot fracture , all in bevacizumab-treated patients ) , and one grade 1 treatment-related event ( vaginal haemorrhage , in a patient treated with standard chemotherapy ) were reported .",3
"Bevacizumab , added to platinum-based chemotherapy , did not increase overall survival in the study population as a whole .",4
"However , an overall survival benefit was recorded in poor-prognosis patients , which is concordant with the progression-free survival results from ICON7 and GOG-218 , and provides further evidence towards the optimum use of bevacizumab in the treatment of ovarian cancer .",4
Spontaneous expulsion of stone was occurred in 62.5 % ( 30 patients out of 46 ) of control group patients and 82 % ( 41 patients out of 50 ) that there was no significant difference ( P > 0.05 ) .,3
"Average time to fix the stone in control group 4.7 8.03 days ( range 2 to 28 days ) and in the study group , 3.7 5.70 days ( range 1 to 23 days ) is significantly different ( P > 0.05 ) .",3
The average amount of analgesic consumption in the control group was 2.3 4.31 and in the study group was 1.48 2.15 that showed significant differences ( P < 0.05 ) .,3
"In this study , although the addition of tamsulosin to conservative treatment of distal ureteral stones in the distal ureteral stone expulsion showed no significant difference between the two groups , but the reduction in the duration of expulsion , reduce pain and reduce the need for analgesic has been beneficial .",4
"Six hundred and twenty four patients were assessed , of whom 136 ( 21.8 % ) were under five years .",3
"Three hundred and thirty five ( 55 % ) had taken medication prior to the current consultation ( self - medication with any product or visiting another HC ) of whom 47 ( 14 % ) took an antimalarial drug , and 56 ( 9 % ) were treated presumptively .",3
"Among those , 53.6 % received monotherapy either with quinine , artesunate , phytomedicines , sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine or amodiaquine .",3
"On the other side , when clinicians were informed about laboratory results , monotherapy was prescribed in 39.9 % of the confirmed malaria cases .",3
"Only 285 patients ( 45.7 % ) were managed in line with WHO and NMCP guidelines , of whom 120 ( 19.2 % ) were prescribed an ACT after positive blood smear and 165 ( 26.4 % ) received no antimalarial after a negative result .",3
"This study shows the discrepancy between malaria policies and the reality on the field in Kinshasa , regarding patients ' health seeking behaviour and health professionals ' practices .",4
"Consequently , the poor compliance to the policies may contribute to the genesis and spread of antimalarial drug resistance and also have a negative impact on the burden of the disease .",4
Participant knowledge about biospecimen research increased from pre - to posteducation in the intervention but not in the control condition .,3
"Of intervention participants , 83.4 % ( 146/175 ) donated one tube of blood for future HBV biospecimen research , and 50.9 % ( 89/175 ) donated another tube of blood for HBV testing .",3
"In contrast , only 1.1 % of participants in the control condition reported donating a blood sample at follow-up assessment .",3
The intervention program significantly increased knowledge of and participation in HBV biospecimen research among Chinese Americans .,4
"Community-based participatory research ( CBPR ) methods featured active support by community leaders , a culturally specific curriculum , and convenient , immediate access to blood sampling , which resulted in high donation rates .",4
HBV-related morbidity and mortality is an urgent problem faced by Chinese Americans .,4
"CBPR provides a model for engaging communities in early detection , vaccination , and treatment that can reduce this health threat .",4
One horse treated with atropine developed colic .,3
Significant pupillary dilatation was observed only with atropine .,3
"Tachycardia developed in all horses , but was more marked with atropine .",3
"Lung function improved with both drugs , but elastance values had returned to baseline at 30min with NBB .",3
There was no improvement in arterial hypoxaemia with either drug .,3
"The study indicated that the bronchodilatory properties of NBB were not statistically different from those of atropine , but were of shorter duration .",4
"N-butylscopolammonium bromide was associated with fewer systemic side effects , and therefore NBB should be preferred over atropine when assessing the reversibility of airway obstruction in horses .",4
"The 64 participants ( mean age , 33.5 years ) showed significantly impaired BRT with the typical postoperative brace set at an ROM of 0 to 30 ( 673 milliseconds , P < .001 ) , ROM of 0 to 60 ( 629 milliseconds , P < .001 ) , ROM of 0 to 90 ( 607 milliseconds , P = .001 ) , and ROM of 20 to 90 ( 602 milliseconds , P = .005 ) compared with the control group .",3
"However , no such impaired BRT was found for any other investigated knee brace .",3
Right-sided ROM-restricting knee braces involve significant impairment of BRT in healthy participants .,4
"No such prolonged BRT was found for a patellofemoral realignment brace , a ligament brace , a valgus/osteoarthritis brace , or an elastic knee bandage .",4
"However , our findings should be viewed in light of the limitations of the study , which are ( 1 ) the lack of a defined decrease in BRT that could lead to an accident and ( 2 ) uncertainty of whether the statistical differences are also clinically important .",4
"A total of 229 patients ( 118 in the web-based group , 111 in the usual-care group ) completed the study .",3
The mean cost of the assessment from the societal perspective was $ 98 per patient for the web-based assessment and $ 162 per patient for the usual method of in-person follow-up .,3
"The cost for the web-based assessment was significantly lower from the societal perspective ( mean difference , $ -64 ; 95 % confidence interval [ CI ] , $ -79 to $ -48 ; p < 0.01 ) and also from the health-care payer perspective ( mean difference , $ -27 ; 95 % CI , $ -29 to $ -25 ; p < 0.01 ) .",3
The web-based follow-up assessment had a lower cost per patient compared with in-person follow-up from both societal and health-care payer perspectives .,4
"The overall response rate to GC was 55.1 % , and complete response was achieved in 28.6 % .",3
"The 3-year overall survival ( OS ) was 51.9 % versus 51.2 % in the chemotherapy and surgery arms , respectively ( P = .399 ) .",3
The 3-year disease-free survival was 31.8 % in the chemotherapy arm and 45.1 % in the surgery arm ( P = .06 ) .,3
Bladder preservation was achieved in 22.5 % of patients in the neoadjuvant arm .,3
OS was 78 % in responding patients and 100 % in patients with complete response .,3
Neoadjuvant GC did not improve survival in locally advanced bladder cancer over radical cystectomy alone .,4
"However , bladder preservation was feasible , and OS in responding patients was impressive .",4
"Therefore , predictive models to select patients are needed .",4
This is the largest prospective study of squamous cell carcinoma and transitional cell carcinoma using neoadjuvant GC .,4
"A limited number of clinical trials have been carried out on children with FXS , but more are necessary as current treatment possibilities are insufficient and often provoke side effects .",4
"In the present study , we sought to overcome possible methodological problems by conducting a phase II pilot study in order to calculate the relevant statistical parameters and determine the safety of the proposed treatment .",4
The results will provide evidence to improve hyperactivity control and reduce behavioural and learning problems using ascorbic acid ( vitamin C ) and - tocopherol ( vitamin E ) .,4
The study protocol was approved by the Regional Government Committee for Clinical Trials in Andalusia and the Spanish agency for drugs and health products .,4
"In the trained participants , fitness , workload , and walking speed improved ( 10 % [ confidence interval ( CI ) 4 % -15 % ] , 18 % [ CI 10 % -26 % ] , 7 % [ CI 4 % -11 % ] , respectively , p < 0.001 , number needed to treat = 2.1 ) .",3
Self-assessed physical capacity and health ( Short Form-36 ) also improved .,3
Muscle strength and daily activity levels did not change with training .,3
Protein-carbohydrate supplementation did not result in further improvements in any tests compared to training alone .,3
"This randomized , controlled study showed that regular endurance training improves fitness , walking speed , and self-assessed health in patients with FSHD without causing muscle damage .",4
Postexercise protein-carbohydrate supplementation does not add any further improvement to training effects alone .,4
"We recruited 241 mother-infant pairs between Feb 25 , and Aug 10 , 2010 , and completed data collection by Aug 6 , 2011 .",3
"At baseline , median urinary iodine concentration was 35 g/L ( IQR 29-40 ) in mothers and 73 g/L ( 29-237 ) in infants , suggesting iodine deficiency .",3
"During the study , maternal urinary iodine concentration ( p = 0.011 ) , breastmilk iodine concentration ( p < 0.0001 ) , and infant urinary iodine concentration ( p = 0.042 ) were higher in the indirect infant supplementation group than in the direct supplementation group .",3
"Maternal TSH ( p = 0.276 ) and T4 ( p = 0.074 ) concentrations did not differ between the groups over the course of the study , nor did infant TSH ( p = 0.597 ) and T4 ( p = 0.184 ) concentrations , but the number of infants with thyroid hypofunction was lower ( p = 0.023 ) in the indirect supplementation group than the direct supplementation group .",3
"The infant groups did not differ in anthropomorphic measures , except that length-for-age Z score was slightly greater in the direct infant supplementation group ( p = 0.032 ) .",3
"At 3 months and 6 months of age , median infant urinary iodine concentration in the indirect infant supplementation group was sufficient ( > 100 g/L ) , whereas infant urinary iodine concentration was sufficient only at 6 months in the direct supplementation group .",3
There were no serious adverse events in either group .,3
"In regions of moderate-to-severe iodine deficiency without effective salt iodisation , lactating women who receive one dose of 400 mg iodine as oral iodised oil soon after delivery can provide adequate iodine to their infants through breastmilk for at least 6 months , enabling the infants to achieve euthyroidism .",4
Direct supplementation is less effective in improving infant iodine status .,4
"There were no significant baseline differences between both treatment groups in terms of patient , lesion , or procedural characteristics .",3
"At 9 months , in-segment late lumen loss in the PCB group was noninferior to that of the paclitaxel-eluting stent group ( 0.46 0.51 mm vs. 0.55 0.61 mm ; difference : -0.06 mm with 95 % confidence interval : -0.23 to 0.10 ; p for noninferiority = 0.0005 ) .",3
The 9-month rate of binary restenosis and 12-month composite clinical event rates were not significantly different between groups .,3
"In a randomized trial of 220 patients , angioplasty with a PCB was noninferior to paclitaxel-eluting stent implantation when used to treat DES-ISR .",4
"On the basis of these , as well as previous randomized trial data , PCB angioplasty offers an effective treatment for DES-ISR without the necessity of implanting additional metal layers for drug release .",4

"We performed an open-label , single-center , parallel-group study comparing the effect of a three-factor PCC ( ProfilnineSD ) with that of a four-factor PCC ( BeriplexP/N ) on the pharmacodynamics of rivaroxaban in 35 healthy volunteers .",3
"After receiving 4days of rivaroxaban 20mg twice daily to obtain supratherapeutic steady-state concentrations , volunteers were randomized to receive a single 50IUkg ( -1 ) bolus dose of four-factor PCC , three-factor PCC or saline 4h after the morning dose of rivaroxaban on day5 , and the effects of these interventions on prothrombin time and thrombin generation were determined .",3
"Within 30min , four-factor PCC reduced mean prothrombin time by 2.5-3 .5 s , whereas three-factor PCC produced only a 0.6-1 .0 - s reduction .",3
"In contrast , three-factor PCC reversed rivaroxaban-induced changes in thrombin generation more than four-factor PCC .",3
This study demonstrates the potential of both three-factor and four-factor PCCs to at least partially reverse the anticoagulant effects of rivaroxaban in healthy adults .,4
The discrepant effects of the PCC preparations may reflect differences in the procoagulant components present in each .,4
"Between visits 1 and 2 , mean anxiety and behavior scores decreased significantly by 0.8 points ( P = .03 ) for subjects within groups C and D. Significant changes were not observed within groups A and B. Mean anxiety and behavior scores did not differ significantly between groups over time , although group A versus C pairwise comparisons showed a trend toward significance ( P = .06 ) .",3
These findings suggest that certain electronic screen media technologies may be useful tools for reducing fear and uncooperative behaviors among children with ASD undergoing dental visits .,4
Further studies are needed to assess the efficacy of these strategies using larger sample sizes .,4
Findings from future studies could be relevant for nondental providers who care for children with ASD in other medical settings .,4
Forty-two CPR-qualified nonprofessionals voluntarily participated in the study .,3
"During the PF session , the rescuers performed CPR with higher compression rates ( 156.8 vs 101.6 cpm ) , more compressions ( 787.2 vs 510.8 per 5 minutes ) , and more duty cycles ( 51.0 % vs 41.7 % ) , but a lower percentage of effective compressions ( 47.7 % vs 57.9 % ) and a lower compression depth ( 35.6 vs 38.0 mm ) than they did during the 100-cpm session .",3
The CPR quality deteriorated in numbers and percentile of effective compression since the third minute in the PF session and the fourth minute in the 100-cpm session .,3
"The percentile of compressions with adequate depth in the 100-cpm sessions was higher than that in the PF sessions during the second , third , and fourth minutes of CPR .",3
Push-fast technique showed a significant decrease in the percentile of effective chest compression compared with the 100-cpm technique during the 5-minute hand-only CPR .,4
"The PF technique exhibited a trend toward increased fatigue in the rescuers , which can result in early decay of CPR quality .",4
"Most respondents were satisfied with their treatment for AF over the previous 12 months , with 85.5 % ( n = 1289 ) rating their care as good or better .",3
"Suboptimal clinical practices , however , were identified in several key areas .",3
"Coordination of primary and secondary care and a lack of patient engagement and support were particular issues , especially for those patients likely to have extensive contact with their healthcare system .",3
"In the context of Europe-wide guidelines for management of AF , most patients with AF were satisfied with their care , but for a greater proportion of patients , some aspects are unsatisfactory .",4
"Patient-centred surveys , such as the EUPS-AF , are crucial for understanding the factors that contribute to patient satisfaction and compliance with long-term treatment for chronic conditions .",4
Correction of isovolemic postoperative anemia in gastric cancer patients after oncologic resection is considered to be beneficial .,4
Administration of ferric carboxymaltose is considered to be superior to placebo for anemia correction without the possible risks of red blood cell transfusion .,4
"Further , improved quality of life for patients with quick recovery of hemoglobin levels is expected .",4
"At baseline , subjects receiving DHEA or placebo exhibited no significant difference in androgens and TNF release from MNCs before and after glucose ingestion .",3
"Compared with placebo , DHEA administration raised levels of T , androstenedione , and DHEA sulfate , and increased MNC-derived AR mRNA content and TNF release in the fasting state and in response to glucose ingestion .",3
"Compared with MNC exposure to baseline concentrations of DHEA ( 175 ng/dL ) or T ( 50 ng/dL ) , the absolute change in TNF release increased after exposure to T concentrations of 125 and 250 ng/dL and a DHEA concentration of 1750 ng/dL .",3
Preincubation with flutamide reduced the TNF response by 60 % across all T concentrations .,3
Androgen excess in vivo and in vitro comparable to what is present in PCOS increases TNF release from MNCs of lean healthy reproductive-age women in a receptor-dependent fashion .,4
Hyperandrogenemia activates and sensitizes MNCs to glucose in this population .,4
"The IN.PACT SFA Trial is a prospective , multicenter , single-blinded , randomized trial in which 331 patients with intermittent claudication or ischemic rest pain attributable to superficial femoral and popliteal peripheral artery disease were randomly assigned in a 2:1 ratio to treatment with DCB or PTA .",3
"The primary efficacy end point was primary patency , defined as freedom from restenosis or clinically driven target lesion revascularization at 12 months .",3
Baseline characteristics were similar between the 2 groups .,3
"Mean lesion length and the percentage of total occlusions for the DCB and PTA arms were 8.94 4.89 and 8.81 5.12 cm ( P = 0.82 ) and 25.8 % and 19.5 % ( P = 0.22 ) , respectively .",3
DCB resulted in higher primary patency versus PTA ( 82.2 % versus 52.4 % ; P < 0.001 ) .,3
The rate of clinically driven target lesion revascularization was 2.4 % in the DCB arm in comparison with 20.6 % in the PTA arm ( P < 0.001 ) .,3
There was a low rate of vessel thrombosis in both arms ( 1.4 % after DCB and 3.7 % after PTA [ P = 0.10 ] ) .,3
There were no device - or procedure-related deaths and no major amputations .,3
"In this prospective , multicenter , randomized trial , DCB was superior to PTA and had a favorable safety profile for the treatment of patients with symptomatic femoropopliteal peripheral artery disease .",4
In each group the heart rate decreased after dexmedetomidine loading .,3
"After intubation , values were higher for Group A at one , three , five , 10 , and 15 minutes .",3
"After intubation , the patients reached desired hypotension values at minute five for Group N and at minute 20 for group A. MAC values were higher for Group N at minute one , three , five , 10 , and 15 ( p < 0.05 ) .",3
"FiO2 values were high between minute five and 60 for Group A , while at minute 90 Group N values were higher ( p < 0.05 ) .",3
Fi Iso ( inspiratuvar isofluran ) values were lower in Group N at minute 15 and 30 ( p < 0.05 ) .,3
"By using dexmedetomidine instead of nitrous oxide in low flow isoflurane anesthesia , we attained desired MAP levels , sufficient anesthesia depth , hemodynamic stability and safe inspiration parameters .",4
Dexmedetomidine infusion with medical air-oxygen as a carrier gas represents an alternative anesthetic technique .,4
The mediating effect of the Home-based Post-Hip Fracture Rehabilitation program on Basic Mobility function through self-efficacy for exercise was significant at 9 months ( indirect = .21 ) .,3
"Similarly , the mediating effect of the intervention on Daily Activity function through self-efficacy for exercise was significant at 9 months ( indirect = .49 ) .",3
"In subgroup analyses , the mediating effect was significant at 9 months in the younger group ( age , 79y ) in comparison to the older group and was significant in women in comparison to men .",3
Self-efficacy may play a partial mediating role in the effect on some longer-term functional outcomes in the Home-based Post-Hip Fracture Rehabilitation intervention .,4
The results suggest that program components that target self-efficacy should be incorporated in future hip fracture rehabilitation interventions .,4
Age and sex of the targeted participants may also need to be considered when developing interventions .,4
The study was prematurely terminated as phase III trials in hepatitis C infection indicated noninferior efficacy but inferior safety compared with pegylated-interferon-2a .,3
"Here , all treatment groups had a significant reduction in HBV-DNA from baseline .",3
"Reductions in HBV-DNA were not significantly different , except the 1200g every 4 weeks albinterferon dose which was inferior compared with pegylated-interferon-2a .",3
The serum alanine aminotransferase levels decreased in all arms .,3
The per-patient incidence of adverse events was not significantly different for albinterferon ( 96.4-100 % ) and pegylated-interferon-2a ( 93.1 % ) .,3
"Total adverse events , however , were higher for albinterferon and correlated to dose .",3
"Decreased lung function was found in all arms ( 93 % of patients ) , and was more common in some albinterferon groups .",3
"Albinterferon doses with similar anti-HBV efficacy to pegylated-interferon-2a had higher rates of certain adverse events , particularly changes in lung diffusion capacity ( http://www.clinicaltrials.gov number NCT00964665 ) .",4
"Both groups were similar for age , sex , site of tumour , operation and tumour stage .",3
"In the intervention group , a higher number of nodes was found [ median 23 ( 5-92 ) vs. 15 ( 5-37 ) , P < 0.001 ] , with only one specimen not achieving the recommended minimum standard of 12 nodes [ 1/50 ( 2 % ) vs. 8/50 ( 16 % ) , P = 0.014 ] .",3
"However , there was no upstaging effect in the intervention group [ 23/50 ( 46.0 % ) vs. 20/50 ( 40.0 % ) ; P = 0.686 ] .",3
"With a significantly lower number of nodes harvested in rectal cancer , the positive effect of the intervention was particularly observed in the patients who underwent preoperative neoadjuvant radiotherapy [ median 30 nodes ( 12-57 ) vs. 11 ( 7-15 ) ; P = 0.011 ; proportion of cases with < 12 nodes 0/5 vs. 5/8 ( 62.5 % ) , P = 0.024 ] .",3
"Ex vivo intra-arterial methylene blue injection increases lymph node yield and can help to reduce the number of cases with a lower-than-recommended number of nodes , particularly in patients with rectal cancer having neoadjuvant treatment .",4
"The technique is easy to perform , cheap and saves time .",4
ED 50 and ED 95 of intrathecal bupivacaine for successful spinal anesthesia were 5.67 mg ( 95 % confidence interval [ CI ] : 5.20-6 .10 mg ) and 8.82 mg ( 95 % CI : 8.14-9 .87 mg ) respectively .,3
The incidence of hypotension in Group 8 mg and Group 10 mg was higher than that in Group 4 mg and Group 6 mg ( P < 0.05 ) .,3
The sensory block was significantly different among groups 10 minutes after intrathecal injection ( P < 0.05 ) .,3
The use of lidocaine in Group 4 mg was higher than that in other groups ( P < 0.05 ) .,3
The use of phenylephrine in Group 8 mg and Group 10 mg was higher than that in the other two groups ( P < 0.05 ) .,3
The lowest systolic blood pressure before the infant delivery of Group 8 mg and Group 10 mg was lower than the other two groups ( P < 0.05 ) .,3
The satisfaction of muscle relaxation in Group 4 mg was lower than other groups ( P < 0.05 ) .,3
There was no significant difference in patients ' satisfaction and the newborns ' Apgar score and the blood gas analysis of umbilical artery serum ( P > 0.05 ) .,3
"Our study showed that the ED 50 and ED 95 of intrathecal bupivacaine for severely preeclamptic patients undergoing elective cesarean delivery were 5.67 mg and 8.82 mg , respectively .",4
"In addition , decreasing the dose of intrathecal bupivacaine could reduce the incidence of maternal hypotension .",4
"Statin use was associated with reduced odds of exacerbations in crude analysis , OR = 0.68 ( 95 % CI 0.51 to 0.91 , p = 0.01 ) , as well as in multivariable conditional logistic regression analysis , OR = 0.67 ( 0.48 to 0.92 , p = 0.01 ) .",3
"However , in the subgroup with the most severe COPD and without cardiovascular comorbidity , we observed a null association between statin use and exacerbations , OR = 1.1 ( 0.5 to 2.1 , p = 0.83 ) .",3
"Furthermore , statin use was associated with reduced odds of a high CRP , OR = 0.69 ( 0.56 to 0.85 , p < 0.001 ) , and a high CRP was associated with an increased risk of exacerbations , HR = 1.62 ( 1.35 to 1.94 , p < 0.001 ) .",3
We estimated the percentage of excess risk of the association of statin use with exacerbations possibly mediated through a reduction of CRP to be 14 % ( 4-51 % ) .,3
"Statin use was associated with reduced odds of exacerbations in individuals with COPD from the general population , although this was not apparent in those with the most severe COPD without cardiovascular comorbidity .",4
Statins may thus only associate with reduced risk of exacerbations in patients with COPD with coexisting cardiovascular disease .,4
Mean ( SD ) lung deposition ( % total dose ) was 18.1 ( 9.1 ) % with the facemask and 22.5 ( 7.9 ) % with the spacer mouthpiece ( p > 0.05 ) .,3
Peripheral lung deposition ( expressed as peripheral : central ( P : C ) ratio ) was higher in 7 out of 10 children with the facemask compared with the spacer mouthpiece : 1.3 ( 0.26 ) vs. 1.2 ( 0.35 ) ; ( p = 0.11 ) .,3
Head and neck deposition was higher with use of the facemask compared with the spacer mouthpiece : 19.7 ( 10.6 ) % vs. 10.8 ( 5.3 ) % ( p = 0.011 ) .,3
"Lung deposition achieved using the spacer with facemask was higher than previously reported , with a difference of only 4.4 % of total dose measured compared to the deposition with mouthpiece .",4
"This may be due to a combination of factors including pMDI formulation , and use of an antistatic spacer with a flexible , well-fitting facemask .",4
"Twenty participants , mean age 63 5 years , participated .",3
Gains made in VO2max were maintained at 6 months ( P < 0.05 ) .,3
"Participants reported engaging in sustained and routine physical activity , yet some identified a need for additional support to adopt the prescribed health behaviors .",3
"Emergent themes included the desire for short-term mHealth intervention to educate individuals about prescribed health behaviors without need for ongoing management by clinicians , leveraging mHealth to build social networks around prescribed health behaviors and to connect individuals to build a sense of community , and participant views of physical activity as medicine .",3
The present study investigated both the long-term adoption of physical activity behaviors as well as the participant experience in a physical activity and mHealth intervention .,4
Findings from the current study may be used to inform the development of user-centered lifestyle interventions .,4
No significant differences were observed in operative data among the groups .,3
Levels of 8-epiPGF2 were significantly higher in LSSC compared with LC at 6 h ( P = 0.003 ) and 24 h ( P < 0.001 ) .,3
"8-epiPGF2 levels showed significant changes over time in LC ( LSSC : P = 0.720 , LC : P < 0.001 ) .",3
"UA levels were significantly higher in LC compared with LSSC , 24 h postoperatively ( P = 0.021 ) .",3
"No significant changes over time in the UA levels in both groups ( LSSC : P = 0.056 , LC : P = 0.205 ) .",3
LSSC is associated with increased oxidative stress compared with LC .,4
Further studies are needed to confirm these results .,4
A total of 29 patients were recruited .,3
"For surgical parameters , there were no statistically significant differences between the groups in the univariate analyses .",3
Multivariable analysis showed no statistically significant difference for total surgical time .,3
This pilot study suggests that intravitreal bevacizumab and ranibizumab are equivalent as surgical adjuvants when used as pre-treatment in patients with PDR undergoing PPV .,4
We report an overall 5-year EFS and OS of 42.36 % and 52.96.5 % respectively .,3
"Poor prognostic factors included age 90 days at diagnosis , MLL-R ALL and white cell count 50,000 / l. For infants 90 days of age , the 5-year EFS was 15.510.1 % and 48.56.7 % for those > 90 days ( P < 0.0001 ) .",3
"Among infants > 90 days of age , 5-year EFS rates were 43.88 % for MLL-R versus 69.113.6 % for MLL-germline ALL ( P < 0.0001 ) .",3
Age 90 days at diagnosis was the most important prognostic factor .,4
"Despite shortened therapy with early intensification , EFS remained less than 50 % overall in MLL-R ALL .",4
Both groups improved significantly during 16 weeks of rehabilitation .,3
"However , neither t tests nor repeated-measures analysis of variance demonstrated any significant differences between the 2 groups .",3
The overall compliance rate to computer program exercises during 16 weeks was 57 % .,3
A computer-assisted program to support the home training of elderly patients with vestibular dysfunction did not improve rehabilitation more than did printed instructions .,4
We randomly assigned 100 patients with drug-resistant AF to an oesophageal cooling group or a control group .,3
"In the oesophageal cooling group , we injected 5 mL of ice water into the oesophagus prior to radiofrequency ( RF ) energy delivery adjacent to the oesophagus .",3
"If the oesophageal temperature reached 42C , the RF energy delivery was stopped , and the ice water injection was repeated .",3
"In the control group , oesophageal cooling was not applied .",3
"Oesophageal endoscopy was performed 1 day after the catheter ablation , and lesions were qualitatively assessed as mild , moderate , or severe .",3
"The numbers of ablation sites with an oesophageal temperature of > 42C were 1.7 1.4 and 2.6 1.7 in the oesophageal cooling group and the control group , respectively ( P = 0.04 ) , and the maximal oesophageal temperature at those sites was 43.0 0.6 and 44.7 0.9 C ( P < 0.0001 ) .",3
Oesophageal lesions occurred almost equally between the oesophageal cooling group [ 10 of 50 patients ( 20 % ) ] and the control group [ 11 of 50 patients ( 22 % ) ] .,3
"However , the severity of the oesophageal lesions was slightly milder in the oesophageal cooling group ( three moderate , seven mild ) than in the control group ( three severe , one moderate , seven mild ) .",3
Oesophageal cooling may alleviate the severity of oesophageal lesions but does not reduce the incidence of this complication under the specific protocol evaluated here .,4

"No difference was observed between the two groups with respect to the left ventricular myocardial performance index ( MPI ) ( 0.62 + / - 0.15 vs. 0.61 + / - 0.13 , P = 0.859 ) .",3
"In this study , we demonstrated for the first time in the literature thatthere was impaired aortic elasticity and increased EFT in patients with brucellosis , while the myocardial performance index remained unaffected .",4
We also determined that these effects had a significant correlation with inflammation .,4
"Participants assigned to CBSM reported significantly lower depressive symptoms ( d , 0.63 ; 95 % confidence interval [ CI ] , 0.56-0 .70 ) and better QOL ( d , 0.58 ; 95 % CI , 0.52-0 .65 ) above the effects of the covariates .",3
Women who received CBSM after surgery for early-stage breast cancer reported lower depressive symptoms and better QOL than the control group up to 15 years later .,4
Early implementation of cognitive-behavioral interventions may influence long-term psychosocial functioning in breast cancer survivors .,4

"Boys in the traditional voucher group had increased rates of PTSD compared with the control group ( 4.9 % vs 1.9 % , OR , 2.7 [ 95 % CI , 1.2-5 .8 ] ) .",3
"However , compared with the control group , girls in the traditional voucher group had decreased rates of major depression ( 6.5 % vs 10.9 % ; OR , 0.6 [ 95 % CI , 0.3-0 .9 ] ) and conduct disorder ( 0.3 % vs 2.9 % ; OR , 0.1 [ 95 % CI , 0.0-0 .4 ] ) .",3
"Interventions to encourage moving out of high-poverty neighborhoods were associated with increased rates of depression , PTSD , and conduct disorder among boys and reduced rates of depression and conduct disorder among girls .",4
"Better understanding of interactions among individual , family , and neighborhood risk factors is needed to guide future public housing policy changes .",4
"Intervention participants gained less weight from randomization to 34 weeks gestation ( 5.0 vs. 8.4 kg , mean difference = -3.4 kg , 95 % CI [ -5.1 -1.8 ] ) , and from randomization to 2 weeks postpartum ( -2.6 vs. +1.2 kg , mean difference = -3.8 kg , 95 % CI [ -5.9 -1.7 ] ) .",3
"They also had a lower proportion of LGA babies ( 9 vs. 26 % , odds ratio = 0.28 , 95 % CI [ 0.09-0 .84 ] ) .",3
The intervention resulted in lower GWG and lower prevalence of LGA newborns .,4
The indices of the control group were not changed ( P > 0.05 ) at the three time points .,3
"At the pre-treatment measurement , there were significant differences ( P > 0.05 ) in indices among the three groups .",3
"At post-treatment , each index of the two groups was lower than that of the control group ( P < 0.05 ) , and improved in comparison with the pre-treatment measurement ( P < 0.05 ) .",3
"In follow-up , each index of the aerobic exercise group and Acu-TENS group increased , but was still decreased compared with the pre-treatment value ( P < 0.05 ) , excluding body mass index .",3

"Patients preferred surgery with the 500 kHz laser with no loss of light perception , less pain , less fear , and less subconjunctival hemorrhage .",4
Surgeons preferred the 60 kHz laser .,4
The preferred normalized SW in older adults during stair descent was 20 % of leg length .,3
Wide and wider SW during stair descent reduced both first and second peak knee adduction angles and abduction moments compared to preferred SW in healthy adults .,3
Increased SW reduced peak knee adduction angles and abduction moments .,4
The reductions in knee abduction moments may have implications in reducing medial compartment knee loads during stair descent .,4
"The proportion of patients with detectable cTnI levels at both time points was 48.5 % , at one time point 28.5 % and at neither time point 21.0 % .",3
"Patients with detectable cTnI at both time points had substantially higher rates of stroke compared with those with transient elevations and those with no elevation at either time point ( p < 0.005 , effect of cTnI ) .",3
Persistent elevation of either or both cardiac biomarkers at baseline and 3 months was associated with a higher risk for cardiovascular events and mortality ( p < 0.0001 ) .,3
Prognostic prediction improved most with the use of repeated measurements of both cardiac biomarkers simultaneously ( p < 0.05 ) and achieved C-statistic 0.644 for stroke compared with 0.611 for CHADS2-score .,3
Persistent elevation of troponin and NT-proBNP indicates a worse prognosis than transient elevations or no elevations of either marker .,4
"Prognostication of stroke , death and thromboembolic events is improved by the use of repeated determinations of cardiac biomarkers .",4
"In the vivo model , TRO40303 reduced infarct size by 40 % at 1 mg/kg and by 50 % at 3 and 10 mg/kg given by intravenous bolus and was only active when administered before reperfusion .",3
"Additionally , TRO40303 provided functional recovery and reduced oxidative stress in the isolated rat heart model.These results , together with pharmacokinetic based allometry to human and non-clinical toxicology data , were used to design the Phase I trial .",3
All the tested doses and flow rates were well tolerated clinically .,3
There were no serious adverse events reported .,3
"No relevant changes in vital signs , electrocardiogram parameters , laboratory tests or physical examinations were observed at any time in any dose group .",3
"Pharmacokinetics was linear up to 6 mg/kg and slightly ~ 1.5-fold , hyper-proportional from 6 to 13 mg/kg .",3
These data demonstrated that TRO40303 can be safely administered by the intravenous route in humans at doses expected to be pharmacologically active .,4
"These results allowed evaluating the expected active dose in human at 6 mg/kg , used in a Phase II proof-of-concept study currently ongoing .",4

"In this largest placebo-controlled trial to date to evaluate the impact of a therapeutic agent on perianal fistulae in Crohn 's disease , the efficacy of AST-120 could not be confirmed .",4
An inverse relationship was observed between both inflammatory and clinical disease activity and fistula response .,4
Independent raters ' Health Care Climate Questionnaire scores favored the intervention arm ( Cohen 's d = 2.27 ; P < .01 ) .,3
"Compared with controls , independent ratings demonstrated that physiotherapists who completed the Communication style and exercise compliance in physiotherapy training were found to provide greater support for patients ' needs in a single assessed session .",4
Long-term maintenance of this needs-supportive behavior should be examined .,4
"Results showed that 3,685 study subjects ( 1.81 % ) had been diagnosed with IDA prior to the index date ; of those subjects , 1,268 ( 2.48 % ) were cases and 2,417 ( 1.58 % ) were controls ( p < 0.001 ) .",3

"Furthermore , the adjusted OR of prior IDA for cases with ischemic stroke was found to be 1.45 ( 95 % CI : 1.34 ~ 1.58 ) compared to controls .",3
"However , we did not find any significant relationship between IDA and subarachnoid/intracerebral hemorrhage even adjusting for other confounding factors ( OR = 1.17 , 95 % CI = 0.97 ~ 1.40 ) .",3
There is a significant association between prior IDA and ischemic stroke .,4

Treatment-emergent adverse events did not differ between the two treatment groups .,3
"The most frequently reported treatment-emergent adverse event were nasopharyngitis , influenza , diarrhoea , headache , peripheral oedema , and wrong drug given .",3
Three participants died : two before randomisation and one in the basal-bolus group ( due to severe acute myocardial infarction and respiratory tract inflammation ) .,3
"Stepwise prandial insulin intensification provides glycaemic control non-inferior to a full basal-bolus regimen after 32 weeks , with significantly lower hypoglycaemia risk and better patient satisfaction .",4
Amlodipine and udenafil both decreased the rate of RP attack significantly .,3
The drugs did not differ in terms of RP frequency or any of the secondary outcomes except for digital blood flow ; udenafil improved it significantly better than amlodipine ( P = 0.021 ) .,3
Udenafil was well tolerated without serious adverse effects .,3
Udenafil and amlodipine have comparable efficacy in improving RP attacks .,4

"Age , gender , pacing mode , and baseline cardiac rhythm did not significantly differ between the RVOT and RVA pacing groups .",3
"The incidence of mitral regurgitation was significantly higher in the RVA group ( p = 0.03 ) , but the incidence of tricuspid regurgitation was similar in both groups .",3
"There was a trend toward less tricuspid regurgitation in the RVOT group ; however , it was not statistically significant .",3
The mean EF was not significantly different between the study groups .,3
It seems that the incidence of mitral regurgitation in RVA pacing is significantly higher than that in RVOT pacing .,4
The formation of tricuspid regurgitation needs to be discussed in the future .,4
"In each group , 24 ( 56 % ) patients had a dissection after the intervention .",3
"At the 6-month follow-up , patients with dissection of any grade after treatment with PCBs had significantly less late lumen loss ( 0.4 mm ) than patients with dissection after treatment with uncoated balloons ( 1.9 mm , p = 0.001 ) and a lower degree of stenosis ( 20 % vs. 51 % , respectively ; p = 0.003 ) .",3
"Patients with severe dissection ( grades C , D , or E ) especially seemed to benefit from the PCBs , with late lumen loss of 0.4 mm vs. 2.4 mm for controls ( p = 0.05 ) .",3
"The binary restenosis rate was also markedly lower in the PCB group ( 20 % ) than in the uncoated group ( 55 % , p = 0.02 ) .",3
"In the 2-year follow-up , TLR was performed in 56 % of patients in the control group compared to 10 % of patients in the PCB group ( p = 0.002 ) .",3
The results of this subgroup analysis suggest that patients with dissection following treatment with a paclitaxel-coated balloon have a very acceptable outcome and stent implantation is not necessary as long as the dissection does not result in acute flow limitation .,4
"MBCT was associated with increased Pe and NoGo-P3 amplitudes , coinciding with reduced ` hyperactivity/impulsivity ' and ` inattention ' symptomatology .",3
"Specific to the MBCT ; enhanced Pe amplitudes correlated with a decrease in hyperactivity/impulsivity symptoms and increased ` act-with-awareness ' mindfulness skill , whereas , enhanced P3 correlated with amelioration in inattention symptoms .",3
"MBCT enhanced ERP amplitudes associated with motivational saliency and error awareness , leading to improved inhibitory regulation .",4
MBCT suggests having comparable modulation on performance monitoring ERP amplitudes as pharmacological treatments .,4

Prostacyclin ( PGI2 ) level and incidence of arrhythmias were similar between the two groups .,3
There was no thrombotic event in both groups during follow up .,3
Bosentan trerapy in patients post Fontan operation could reduce the incidence of pulmonary arteriovenous fistulae and protein losing enteropathy and improve heart function .,4
"Men in both groups completed the trial , and those in the MCT arm , almost all of the group sessions .",3
"The MCT arm had a significant advantage in improvement of ` suspiciousness ' , greatest at 3months , but then declining .",3
No significant improvement in reasoning ability was achieved .,3
"Metacognitive training showed sufficient promise in this group for a full trial to be worthwhile , and the feasibility of an RCT methodology , even in a secure hospital , was established .",4
"The fact that the improvements faded during follow-up suggests that a useful modification to the treatment would be lengthening the protocol , repeating it , or both .",4
"The maximum tolerated dose of axitinib was 10 mg b.i.d. , in a week-on/week-off schedule , combined with FOLFIRI or FOLFOX .",3

"Following 7 days of continuous axitinib dosing , tumour ( 18 ) FLT uptake decreased -49 % from baseline and recovered to -28 % and -17 % from baseline , respectively , after 3 and 7 days of axitinib interruption .",3
Axitinib administered in a week-on/week-off schedule combined with FOLFIRI or FOLFOX is supported by ( 18 ) FLT-PET data and was well tolerated in patients with gastrointestinal tumours .,4
"Of the patients allocated to treatment for this study , 76 received a matched treatment and 25 received an unmatched treatment .",3
"After treatment , both groups showed a statistically significant improvement in the primary outcome measures and almost all the secondary measures ; however , the matched treatment group did not demonstrate superior outcomes at Week 7 or 12 months , except on one of the secondary measures ( Graded Chronic Pain Scale [ Disability Scale ] ) ( p = .01 ) .",3
"Providing a matched treatment based on either the Treatment-Based Classification or the Movement System Impairment classification schema did not improve treatment outcomes compared with an unmatched treatment for patients with chronic LBP , except on one secondary disability measure .",4
"The median dose of morphine administered in the PACU was 2 mg [ 0-3 ] in the ropivacaine vs. 4 mg [ 3-6 ] in the placebo group ( P = 0.0004 , Mann-Whitney 's test ) .",3
Pain at rest and at movement was lower in the ropivacaine group throughout observation in the PACU .,3
No difference was found for both pain and opioid consumption after discharge from the PACU or for patient satisfaction .,3
Sedative events in the early post-operative period were less frequent in the ropivacaine group .,3
"Local anaesthetic wound infiltration performed before closure reduces the need for additional opioids , lowers the immediate post-operative pain and improves alertness .",4
These results argue for the use of local infiltration anaesthesia for carotid endarterectomy .,4
There is a lack of evidence determining the length of anticoagulation for patients with cancer associated thrombosis and subsequently treatment length varies .,4
The ALICAT study will consider the feasibility of recruiting patients to a phase three trial .,4
"The randomized midluteal phase surgery group had a five-year DFS of 64 % , compared with 71 % for the immediate surgery random assignment group ( hazard ratio [ HR ] = 1.24 , 95 % confidence interval [ CI ] = 0.91 to 1.68 , P = .18 ) .",3
"Multivariable Cox regression models , which included important prognostic variables , gave similar results ( aHR = 1.28 , 95 % CI = 0.94 to 1.76 , P = .12 ) .",3
"For overall survival , the univariate hazard ratio was 1.33 ( 95 % CI = 0.94 to 1.89 , P = .11 ) and the multivariable aHR was 1.43 ( 95 % CI = 1.00 to 2.06 , P = .05 ) .",3
"Better DFS for follicular phase surgery , which was unanticipated , proved consistent across multiple exploratory analyses .",3
The hypothesized benefit of adjuvant luteal phase oophorectomy was not shown in this large trial .,4
"Current smokers ( n = 5,688 ) had an increased risk of ischemic events compared with never smokers ( n = 4,135 ; hazard ratio [ HR ] : 1.24 [ 95 % confidence interval ( CI ) : 1.08 to 1.42 ] ) and ex-smokers ( n = 9,381 ; HR : 1.32 [ 95 % CI : 1.18 to 1.47 ] ) ( p < 0.001 ) .",3
"Clopidogrel was associated with a reduction in ischemic events among current smokers ( 8.3 % vs. 10.8 % ; HR : 0.76 [ 95 % CI : 0.64 to 0.90 ] ) , whereas no benefit over aspirin was seen in the combined group of ex-smokers/never-smoked patients ( 10.4 % vs. 10.6 % ; HR : 0.99 [ 95 % CI : 0.89 to 1.10 ] ; p = 0.01 for interaction ) .",3
"Among current smokers , clopidogrel also reduced myocardial infarction , vascular death , and death from any cause compared with aspirin .",3
No interaction between smoking status and study treatment was observed for bleeding events .,3
"In a post-hoc analysis of the CAPRIE population , current smokers appeared to have enhanced benefit with clopidogrel therapy for secondary prevention compared with aspirin .",4
These results should be considered hypothesis generating for future prospective studies assessing the impact of specific platelet-inhibiting strategies according to smoking status .,4
"While there were no significant differences in the preexperience test scores between the groups , there was a significant increase in scores in both the virtual-patient group and the PBL group between the preexperience and postexperience tests .",3
The PBL group had higher postexperience test scores ( 74.811.7 ) than did the virtual-patient group ( 66.513.6 ) ( p = 0.001 ) .,3
The PBL method demonstrated significantly greater improvement in postexperience test scores than did the virtual-patient method .,4
"Both were successful learning methods , suggesting that a diverse approach to simulated patient cases may reach more student learning styles .",4
"Only the Evans6 and Toronto7 subscale had almost the same predictive value as the HAMD17 ( e.g. , sensitivities stable remission Evans6/Toronto7 : 96/95 % vs. 96 % HAMD17 ) .",3
The optimal cut-off for EI to predict remission was just below 20 % for most subscales and slightly over 20 % for stable remission .,3
"Study sample representativeness , non-independence of subscales , missing external validation criterion , lack of control group .",4
"The Evans6 and Toronto7 subscales are valuable alternatives in situations , where economic aspects play a larger role .",4
"A sum score reduction of 20 % as definition for EI seems also appropriate for the HAMD subscales , in the total as well as in the antidepressant subgroups .",4
A total of 1027 newborns were included .,3
"There was no statistically significant difference in the incidence of HR100 bpm at 2 minutes after birth between the T-piece and self-inflating bag groups : 94 % ( 479 of 511 ) and 90 % ( 466 of 516 ) , respectively ( OR , 0.65 ; 95 % CI , 0.41-1 .05 ; P = .08 ) .",3
"A total of 86 newborns ( 17 % ) in the T-piece group and 134 newborns ( 26 % ) in the self-inflating bag group were intubated in the delivery room ( OR , 0.58 ; 95 % CI , 0.4-0 .8 ; P = .002 ) .",3
The meanSD maximum positive inspiratory pressure was 262 cm H2O in the T-piece group vs 285 cm H2O in the self-inflating bag group ( P < .001 ) .,3
"Air leaks , use of drugs/chest compressions , mortality , and days on mechanical ventilation did not differ significantly between groups .",3
There was no difference between the T-piece resuscitator and a self-inflating bag in achieving an HR of 100 bpm at 2 minutes in newborns26 weeks gestational age resuscitated at birth .,4
"However , use of the T-piece decreased the intubation rate and the maximum pressures applied .",4
"Fifty patients were available for analysis , with 25 women randomly assigned to TB ( arm A ) and 25 to SES ( arm B ) .",3
The median operative time was 85 minutes for TB vs 115 minutes for SES ( p = .001 ) .,3
"At multivariate analysis , endometrial cancer ( p = .001 ) and TB ( p = .001 ) were independently associated with shorter operating time .",3
No differences in perioperative outcomes and postoperative complications were observed between the 2 arms .,3
"Patients who underwent TB reported less postoperative pain , both at rest ( p = .005 ) and after the Valsalva maneuver ( p = .008 ) , with less additional analgesic therapy other than standard therapy required in patients who underwent SES ( p = .02 ) .",3
TB is associated with shorter operative time and less postoperative pain than is the standard technique ( SES ) in patients with uterine cancer .,4
Median follow-up was 35months ( range11-57 ) .,3
"The overall early , delayed and long-term response rates for all patients were 83 , 85 and 82 % , respectively .",3
"The mean VAS scores before treatment and those for early , delayed and long-term response in the 0.5 - and 1.0-Gy groups were 56.823.7 and 53.221.8 ( p = 0.16 ) ; 38.236.1 and 34.024.5 ( p = 0.19 ) ; 33.027.2 and 23.722.7 ( p = 0.04 ) and 27.925.8 and 32.126.9 ( p = 0.25 ) , respectively .",3
"The mean CPS values before treatment and those for early , delayed and long-term response were 9.73.0 and 9.52.7 ( p = 0.31 ) ; 6.13.6 and 5.43.6 ( p = 0.10 ) ; 5.33.7 and 4.13.7 ( p = 0.05 ) and 4.03.9 and 5.34.4 ( p = 0.05 ) , respectively .",3
No significant differences in the quality of the long-term response were found between the 0.5 - and 1.0-Gy arms ( p = 0.28 ) .,3
Radiotherapy is an effective treatment for the management of benign painful shoulder syndrome .,4
"For radiation protection reasons , the dose for a radiotherapy series should not exceed 3.0 Gy .",4
Analysis was by linear mixed model .,3
Fifty-two participants ( 86.7 % ) completed the trial .,3
"Compared to placebo , adjunctive pregnenolone significantly reduced Positive and Negative Symptoms Scale negative symptom scores with moderate effect sizes ( d = 0.79 ) .",3
Significant improvement was observed in weeks 6 and 8 of pregnenolone therapy among patients who were not treated with concomitant mood stabilizers ( armsvisitmood stabilizers ; P = 0.010 ) .,3
"Likewise , pregnenolone significantly reduced Assessment of Negative Symptoms scores compared to placebo ( d = 0.57 ) , especially on blunted affect , avolition and anhedonia domain scores .",3
"Other symptoms , functioning , and side-effects were not significantly affected by adjunctive pregnenolone .",3
"Antipsychotic agents , benzodiazepines and sex did not associate with pregnenolone augmentation .",3
Pregnenolone was well tolerated .,3
"Thus , add-on pregnenolone reduces the severity of negative symptoms in recent-onset schizophrenia and schizoaffective disorder , especially among patients who are not treated with concomitant mood stabilizers .",4
Further studies are warranted .,4
"We informed 9,579 older people about the study .",3
"Seventy consenting participants were randomised to the pilot in 95days , with 56 ( 80 % ) providing valid primary outcome data ( 26 intervention , 30 control ) .",3
Twenty-four participants randomly allocated to the research arm actually received telephone befriending due to poor recruitment and retention of volunteer facilitators .,3
The trial was closed early as a result .,3
"The mean 6-month SF-36 MH scores were 78 ( SD 18 ) and 71 ( SD 21 ) for the intervention and control groups , respectively ( mean difference , 7 ; 95 % CI , -3 to 16 ) .",3
Recruitment and retention of participants to a definitive trial with a recruitment window of 1year is feasible .,4
"For the voluntary sector to recruit sufficient volunteers to match demand for telephone befriending created by trial recruitment would require the study to be run in more than one major population centre , and/or involve dedicated management of volunteers .",4
"There were 154 families who participated ( 76 intervention , 78 standard curriculum ) including 197 children < 4 years old .",3
Families were primarily Latino and Spanish-speaking .,3
Intervention families were significantly less likely to visit the PED when their young child ( age 6 to < 48 months ) was ill ( 8.2 % vs 15.7 % ; P = .025 ) .,3
The difference remained significant on the family level ( P = .03 ) .,3
"These families were also less likely to use an inappropriate over-the-counter medication for their < 2-year-old child ( odds ratio , 0.29 ; 95 % confidence interval , 0.09-0 .95 ; 12.2 % vs 32.4 % , P = .034 ) and/or incorrect dosing tool for their < 4-year-old child ( odds ratio , 0.24 ; 95 % confidence interval , 0.08-0 .74 ; 9.8 % vs 31.1 % ; P < .01 ) .",3
The mean difference in Knowledge-Attitude scores for intervention families was higher .,3
A URI health literacy-related educational intervention embedded into EHS decreased PED visits and adverse care practices .,4
The results will demonstrate whether Schroth exercises combined with standard of care can improve outcomes in adolescents with idiopathic scoliosis .,4
"This study has potential to influence clinical practice worldwide , where exercises are not routinely prescribed for adolescents with idiopathic scoliosis .",4
The absolute AUC values obtained at any single time point by the two tests were well correlated in both data sets ( r = 0.74-0 .9 ) .,3
"However , the correlations between the AUC were much weaker ( r = 0.39-0 .58 ) .",3
"GST-stimulated C-peptide secretion was stable over the fasting glucose range permitted for the test ( 4-11 .1 mmol/L ) , but MMTT-stimulated C-peptide secretion decreased over the same range , implying differences in sensitivity to glucose .",3
"Measurement of long-term changes in stimulated C-peptide , reflecting endogenous insulin secretion , during the course of intervention trials may be affected by the method of stimulation , possibly reflecting different sensitivities to the physiological status of the tested subject .",4
"For total mortality , benefits were consistent : men [ hazard ratio 0.82 , 95 % confidence interval ( CI ) 0.62-1 .11 ] , women ( hazard ratio 0.77 , 95 % CI 0.66-0 .99 ) , those aged 80-84 .9 ( hazard ratio 0.76 , 95 % CI 0.60-0 .96 ) , those aged 85 and over ( hazard ratio 0.87 , 95 % CI 0.64-1 .20 ) , those with a history of CVD ( hazard ratio 0.76 , 95 % CI 0.48-1 .20 ) and those without ( hazard ratio 0.81 , 95 % CI 0.65-0 .99 ) , and similarly across a range of baseline SBPs .",3
"The point estimates for cardiovascular mortality , strokes , heart failure and cardiovascular events were all in favour of benefit .",3
"In the per-protocol analysis , strokes were reduced by 34 % ( P = 0.026 ) , total mortality by 28 % ( P = 0.001 ) , cardiovascular event by 37 % ( P < 0.001 ) and heart failure by 72 % ( P < 0.001 ) .",3
"In hypertensive patients aged 80 or more , treatment based on indapamide ( sustained-release ) 1.5 mg showed consistent benefits across pre-specified subgroups including those without established CVD ( the majority ) , supporting the need for treatment even at this advanced age .",4
There were too few aged 90 or over to determine benefit from treatment at extreme age .,4
"BSAC was effective in increasing knowledge about cancer and risk factors for cancer ( p < .001 ) , as well as in increasing intentions to engage in health-promoting behavior ( p < .001 ) , independent of a student 's risk profile .",3
Knowledge did not serve as a mediator for intention building .,3
"The BSAC is an effective school-based program for raising awareness of cancer , associated risk factors and intentions to engage in cancer-preventive behavior .",4
The results indicate that the effectiveness of BSAC is independent of a student 's risk profile .,4
"Therefore , it holds considerable promise as a broadly applicable program to raise cancer awareness and promote healthy behavior intentions .",4
"Angiomyolipoma response rates were 53.3 % ( 16/30 ) and 0 % ( 0/14 ) for everolimus - and placebo-treated patients , respectively .",3
"Angiomyolipoma reductions 50 % in the sum of volumes of all target lesions were seen only in everolimus-treated patients ( 56.5 , 78.3 and 80.0 % ) compared with placebo-treated patients ( 0 % at each time point ) at Weeks 12 , 24 and 48 , respectively .",3
"Greater percentages of everolimus-treated patients had angiomyolipoma reductions 30 % at these same time points ( 82.6 , 100 and 100 % versus 8.3 , 18.2 and 16.7 % for everolimus versus placebo , respectively ) .",3
"Everolimus showed efficacy in reducing angiomyolipoma lesion volume in patients with SEGA associated with TSC.The trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov , number NCT00789828 ; http://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT00789828?term=EXIST-1&rank=1 .",4
"Mean age did not differ between the control and glaucoma groups ( 59.55 9.7 years and 61.05 9.4 years , resp. ; P = 0.15 ) .",3
"Significant differences were found for the threshold sensitivities at each of the 52 points evaluated with SAP ( P < 0.001 ) and the peripapillary retinal nerve fiber layer ( RNFL ) thicknesses , except at 3 and 9 clock-hour positions between both groups .",3
Mild to moderate correlations ( ranging between 0.286 and 0.593 ; P < 0.001 ) were observed between SAP and most OCT parameters in the glaucoma group .,3
The strongest correlations were found between the inferior RNFL thickness and the superior hemifield points .,3
The healthy group showed lower and weaker correlations than the glaucoma group .,3
Peripapillary RNFL thickness measured with Cirrus OCT showed mild to moderate correlations with SAP in glaucoma patients .,4
"A randomized , double-blind , crossover study with - Cx ( 0.75 mg/day ) and PS ( 1.5 g/day ) , single and combined , was performed in 38 postmenopausal women .",3
Diet was supplemented with 1 250 mL milk-based fruit drink/day for 4 weeks with a wash-out period of 4-weeks in between .,3
Serum - Cx and PS were determined by UPLC and CG-FID respectively .,3
Outcome variables included markers of bone turnover and cardiovascular risk .,3
"Biological effect was assessed by paired t test and generalized estimating equations analysis that included the previous treatment , the order of intervention and the interactions .",3
"The intake of beverages containing - Cx and PS brought about a significant increase in serum levels of - Cx , - sitosterol and campesterol .",3
"Intervention caused changes in almost all the markers while the order , previous treatment and the interaction did not reach statistical significance .",3
"Only the intake of the beverage containing - Cx plus PS brought about significant decreases in total cholesterol , c-HDL , c-LDL and bone turnover markers .",3
- Cx improves the cholesterol-lowering effect of PS when supplied simultaneously and this combination may also be beneficial in reducing risk of osteoporosis .,4
"3360 women were recruited from 174 centres in seven countries between Sept 4 , 2003 , and Feb 16 , 2006 .",3
"The number of DFS events did not differ between groups : 493 in the control group and 473 in the zoledronic acid group ( adjusted hazard ratio [ HR ] 094 , 95 % CI 082-106 ; p = 030 ) .",3
"IDFS ( HR 093 , 95 % CI 082-105 ; p = 022 ) , overall survival ( 093 , 081-108 ; p = 037 ) , and distant recurrences ( 093 , 081-107 ; p = 029 ) were much the same in both groups .",3
"Zoledronic acid reduced the development of bone metastases , both as a first event ( HR 078 , 95 % CI 063-096 ; p = 0020 ) and at any time during follow-up ( 081 , 068-097 ; p = 0022 ) .",3
The effects of zoledronic acid on DFS were not affected by oestrogen-receptor status .,3
"However , zoledronic acid improved IDFS in those who were over 5 years since menopause at trial entry ( n = 1041 ; HR 077 , 95 % CI 063-096 ) but not in all other ( premenopause , perimenopause , and unknown status ) menopausal groups ( n = 2318 ; HR 103 , 95 % CI 089-120 ) .",3
"33 cases of suspected osteonecrosis of the jaw have been reported , with 26 confirmed on central review , all in the zoledronic acid group ( 17 % , 95 % CI 10-24 ) .",3
These results suggest no overall benefit from the addition of zoledronic acid to standard adjuvant treatments for early breast cancer .,4
"However , zoledronic acid does reduce the development of bone metastases and , for women with established menopause , improved disease outcomes .",4
There were 278 deaths in the amlodipine group and 262 deaths in the placebo group ( hazard ratio : 1.09 ; 95 % confidence interval [ CI ] : 0.92 to 1.29 ; p = 0.33 ) .,3
The differences between the 2 groups in the risks for cardiovascular death and hospitalization were also not significant .,3
"When the results from patients with a nonischemic cardiomyopathy in both the earlier trial and in the current study were combined , there was no evidence of a favorable or unfavorable effect of amlodipine on mortality ( hazard ratio : 0.97 ; 95 % CI : 0.83 to 1.13 ; p = 0.66 ) .",3
"Both trials , however , observed higher frequencies of peripheral edema and pulmonary edema and lower frequencies of uncontrolled hypertension and chest pain in patients treated with amlodipine .",3
"These results of the current trial , viewed together with the results from the earlier study , indicate that amlodipine does not exert favorable effects on the clinical course of patients with heart failure , regardless of the presence or absence of underlying coronary artery disease .",4
These findings indicate the need for great caution when striking benefits are observed in subgroups of patients or in trials not primarily designed to assess such effects .,4
The median follow-up time was 69 months .,3
"The 5-year OS and PFS were 80.5 % and 73.2 % , respectively , for all patients .",3
"There was no significant difference in OS , PFS , xerostomia and neck skin toxicity grade 3 and greater among groups .",3
There was no difference among groups .,3
The incidence of NS was the highest in group C.,3
The symptoms of NS seriously affected the QOL period of 1 year .,4
"Group C showed no improvement during the follow-up period , which for A and B , by contrast , had after 1 year .",4
"Although the exact mechanism remains to be explored in NIT , our findings suggest that patients with NPC should nasal irrigate for 2 years after radiotherapy .",4
Our study shows that a nasal irrigator is necessary for patients with NPC for a high QOL in terms of NS .,4
Fifty-two patients were enrolled : 36 ( 69 % ) had POAG and 16 ( 31 % ) had secondary glaucoma .,3
Group 1 ( n = 24 ) and group 2 ( n = 28 ) had similar demographics and baseline characteristics .,3
"In group 1 , IOP was reduced from a mean preoperative value of 29.7 7.7 mm Hg ( n = 3.5 glaucoma medications ) to a mean postoperative value of 21.3 6.7 mm Hg ( n = 3.5 glaucoma medications ) and 20.1 6.7 mm Hg ( n = 3.2 glaucoma medications ) at 6 and 12 months , respectively .",3
"In group 2 , IOP was reduced from a mean preoperative value of 29.0 7.4 mm Hg ( n = 3.3 glaucoma medications ) to a mean postoperative value of 20.2 7.4 mm Hg ( n = 3.4 glaucoma medications ) and 18.5 6.6 mm Hg ( n = 3.5 glaucoma medications ) at 6 and 12 months , respectively .",3
"At 12 months , the IOP reduction was sustained in both groups ( 32 % IOP reduction in group 1 and 36 % IOP reduction in group 2 ) .",3
"The overall tolerance of the technique was good , with no serious adverse events .",3
The new miniaturized HIFU EyeOP1 delivery device seems to be effective in decreasing IOP in patients with refractory glaucoma .,4
The technology offers a good safety profile .,4
"( ClinicalTrials.gov number , NCT01338467 . )",4
"Participants ( n = 807 ) had mean age 60 years , diabetes duration 16 years , BMI 36.6 kg/m ( 2 ) , and HbA1c 8.15 % ( 65.6 mmol/mol ) .",3
HbA1c reduction was equivalent between regimens ; least squares mean difference -0.00 % ( 95 % CI -0.11 to 0.11 ) ( -0.00 mmol/mol [ -1.2 to 1.2 ] ) .,3
Fewer participants reported one or more confirmed ( 3.9 mmol/L ) or severe nocturnal hypoglycemic events between week 9 and month 6 with Gla-300 ( 36 vs. 46 % with Gla-100 ; relative risk 0.79 [ 95 % CI 0.67-0 .93 ] ; P < 0.005 ) ; nocturnal hypoglycemia incidence and event rates were also lower with Gla-300 in the first 8 weeks of treatment .,3
No between-treatment differences in tolerability or safety were identified .,3
Gla-300 controls HbA1c as well as Gla-100 for people with type 2 diabetes treated with basal and mealtime insulin but with consistently less risk of nocturnal hypoglycemia .,4
Steady-state concentrations of pazopanib in plasma seemed to be reached by Week 2 .,3
"At Week 4 ( Study 2 ) , there were no meaningful changes from baseline in the mean central retinal thickness ( 37.9 m ) or best-corrected visual acuity ( 0.1 letters ) ( primary endpoint ) , retinal morphology , choroidal neovascularization size , or total lesion size .",3
Complement Factor H genotype had no effect on changes from baseline in the best-corrected visual acuity or central retinal thickness .,3
"The most common pazopanib-related ocular adverse events included eye irritation ( Study 1 , n = 7 ) and instillation site pain ( Study 2 , n = 3 ) .",3
No serious adverse events were reported .,3
Pazopanib was well tolerated .,4
"In subjects with previously untreated neovascular age-related macular degeneration , pazopanib instilled 4 times daily as monothereapy did not seem to improve the best-corrected visual acuity or decrease the central retinal thickness .",4
"The TG had a positive effect to physical training , with a significant increase in peak oxygen consumption .",3
The CG did not show any statistically significant change before and after the intervention .,3
"After the intervention period , 72.7 % of the TG sample had negative results to the HUT , not having syncope in the revaluation .",3
"The program of supervised aerobic physical training for 12 weeks was able to reduce the number of positive HUT , as it was able to increase tolerance time in orthostatic position during the HUT after the intervention period .",4
"Between March 1 , 2010 , and Oct 19 , 2011 , 93 patients with idiopathic normal pressure hydrocephalus were enrolled and randomly assigned to the immediate treatment group ( n = 49 ) or the postponed treatment group ( n = 44 ) .",3
More patients in the immediate treatment group than in the postponed treatment group had an improvement of one point or more on the mRS at 3 months : 32 ( 65 % ) of 49 in the immediate group vs 2 ( 5 % ) of 44 in the postponed group ( difference 61 % [ 95 % CI 42-68 ] ; p < 00001 ) .,3
The number of patients who had an improvement of one point or more on the mRS at 12 months after surgery was similar between the two groups : 30 ( 67 % ) of 45 patients in the immediate group vs 22 ( 58 % ) of 38 in the postponed group ( difference 9 % [ 95 % CI -14 to 31 ] ; p = 0496 ) .,3
The proportions of patients with serious adverse events did not differ significantly between the groups during the 3 months post-randomisation ( 7 [ 15 % ] of 46 in the immediate group vs 1 [ 2 % ] of 42 in the postponed group ; p = 0060 ) .,3
"During the 12 months after surgery , 19 ( 22 % ) of 87 patients had serious adverse events , the most common of which was cerebral infarction ( six patients [ 7 % ] ) .",3
"Our results suggest that lumboperitoneal shunt surgery might be beneficial for patients with idiopathic normal pressure hydrocephalus and , if these findings are confirmed in larger studies , could be a first-line treatment option for this disease .",4
"In patients randomized to the MRI group , who had an observed higher percentage of planned breast-conserving surgery ( BCS ) compared with the control group , a change from suggested breast conservation to mastectomy occurred in 23 of 153 ( 15 % ) patients .",3
"Breast MRI provided additional information in 83 of 220 ( 38 % ) patients , which caused a change in treatment plan in 40 ( 18 % ) .",3
The breast reoperation rate was significantly lower in the MRI group : 11 of 220 ( 5 % ) versus 33 of 220 ( 15 % ) in the control group ( p < 0.001 ) .,3
"The number of mastectomies , axillary reoperations , and the number of patients receiving neoadjuvant chemotherapy after definitive treatment did not differ significantly between the groups .",3
Preoperative staging with breast MRI in women younger than age 56 years altered the treatment plan in 18 % of the patients .,4
"Although a higher MRI-related conversion rate from breast conservation to mastectomy was found , the final numbers of mastectomies did not differ between the two groups .",4
The breast reoperation rate in the MRI group was significantly reduced .,4
Mean pethidine injection was significantly lower in the group who underwent bupivacaine instillation ( 20.514.5 vs 3.972.4 mg : P = 0.009 ) .,3
There was no significant difference between mean visual analogue scale ( VAS ) score in these two groups after 6 and 12 hours while it was significantly lower after 18 and 24 hours in the patients who had received bupivacaine .,3
Mean time to the first analgesic request was significantly longer in the study group ( 11.35 vs 6.44 hours : P = 0.001 ) .,3
Intermittent perirenal instillation of bupivacaine via the nephrostomy tract after PCNL decreases the need for more systemic narcotics and provides acceptable analgesia in the postoperative period .,4
"Systemic markers of inflammation were determined in a 12-month , real-world , multicenter , randomized , controlled trial that investigated the effect of diet , diet plus physical activity , and usual care in 593 individuals with newly diagnosed T2D .",3
"During the first 6 months , serum C-reactive protein ( CRP ) improved by -21 ( -36 to -1.4 ) % and -22 ( -38 to -3.1 ) % in diet and diet plus physical activity arms versus usual care .",3
There were also improvements in adiponectin and soluble intercellular adhesion molecule-1 ( sICAM-1 ) .,3
"Though medication-adjusted CRP was improved between 6 and 12 months for usual care , both interventions were more successful in reducing the relative risk of a high-risk CRP level of > 3 mg/L ( risk ratios of 0.72 [ 0.55 to 0.95 ] for diet versus usual care and 0.67 [ 0.50 to 0.90 ] for diet plus activity versus usual care ) .",3
"Furthermore , sICAM-1 ( a marker of vascular risk ) , remained substantially lower than usual care in both intervention arms at 12 months .",3
"Motivational , unsupervised diet and/or diet plus physical activity interventions given soon after diagnosis in real-world healthcare settings improve markers of inflammation and cardiovascular risk in patients with T2D , even after accounting for the effect of adjustments to medication to try and control blood pressure , glycated hemoglobin , and lipids .",4
Patients with melancholic features ( n = 339 ; 33.7 % ) were distinguished clinically from non-melancholics by more severe depressive symptoms and greater exposure to abuse in childhood .,3
"Psychologically , melancholic patients were defined by introversion , and a greater use of suppression to regulate negative emotion .",3
"Melancholics also had poorer capacity for social and occupational function , and physical and psychological quality of life , along with poorer coping , reflected in less emotional resilience and capacity for social skills .",3
"Post-treatment , melancholic patients had lower remission and response , but some of this effect was due to the more severe symptoms pre-treatment .",3
The distress/coping outcome measure of capacity for social skills remained significantly lower for melancholic participants .,3
"Due to the cross-sectional nature of this study , causal pathways can not be concluded .",4
Findings provide new insights into a melancholic profile of reduced ability to function interpersonally or effectively deal with ones emotions .,4
This distinctly poorer capacity for social skills remained post-treatment .,4
The pre-treatment profile may account for some of the difficulty in achieving remission or response with treatment .,4
Median time to clinically relevant response as estimated by 50 % reduction in clinical signs and symptoms ( CSS ) total score over the entire trial was similar for subjects treated with HC-ac 2.5 % ( 73.5 h ) and for subjects treated with HC-ac 1.0 % ( 67.7 h ) and was considerably and significantly longer for subjects treated with HC-ac 0.5 % ( 111.8 h ) [ p < 0.001 for both dosages ] .,3
All trial medications were safe and well tolerated .,3
"Hydrocortisone acetate 2.5 % and Hydrocortisone acetate 1 % eye ointments are efficacious and safe treatments for acute inflammations of the ocular surface or adnexa , and showed significantly better efficacy than a control group treated with Hydrocortisone acetate 0.5 % therapy .",4
"Fingolimod reduced BV loss over 12 months versus IFN-1a IM in all patient subgroups assessed , including individuals with or without gadolinium ( Gd ) - enhancing lesions at baseline .",3
Baseline T1 hypointense lesion volume had the strongest correlation with baseline NBV .,3
Baseline Gd-enhancing T1 lesion count was most predictive of change in PBVC over 12 months .,3
"Our results improve understanding of the contributions of different baseline demographic , clinical and MRI characteristics to NBV , including factors that may be predictive of future BV loss .",4
Two hundred and seventy-nine patients in the SLCG trial and 124 in the Chinese trial were assessable for PFS .,3
"PFS in the control and experimental arms in the SLCG trial was 5.49 and 4.38 months , respectively [ log rank P = 0.07 ; hazard ratio ( HR ) 1.28 ; P = 0.03 ] .",3
"In the Chinese trial , PFS was 4.74 and 3.78 months , respectively ( log rank P = 0.82 ; HR 0.95 ; P = 0.82 ) .",3
Accrual was prematurely closed on the SLCG trial due to the absence of clinical benefit in the experimental over the control arm .,4
"However , the BREC studies provide proof of concept that an international , nonindustry , biomarker-directed trial is feasible .",4
"Thanks to the groundwork laid by these studies , we expect that ongoing further research on alternative biomarkers to elucidate DNA repair mechanisms will help define novel therapeutic approaches .",4
"Mean SD area under the concentration-time curve was 5.92 0.40 gh/mL for regimen 1 , which differed significantly from that for regimens 2 ( 14.26 0.92 gh/mL ) and 3 ( 14.17 0.51 gh/mL ) .",3
Mean residence time and mean elimination half-life for regimen 2 ( 9.93 0.20 hours and 8.77 0.71 hours ) both differed significantly from those for regimens 1 ( 721 0.11 hours and 5.71 0.38 hours ) and 3 ( 759 0.13 hours and 737 1.19 hours ) .,3
"Values obtained from indices for P multocida and M haemolytica had an excessively wide range because of the various degrees of antimicrobial susceptibility ( low , medium , and high ) of the strains .",3
"Regimen 3 had the most favorable indices , and it would be conducive for owner compliance and require less handling of animals .",4
The trial accrued 210 eligible patients ( 105 randomly assigned to each arm ) .,3
Patient characteristics were similar in both arms .,3
"Undetectable PSA rate was 42 ( 40.0 % ) of 105 for cixutumumab plus AD and 34 ( 32.3 % ) of 105 for AD alone ( relative risk , 1.24 ; one-sided P = .16 ) .",3
Lower baseline CTCs ( 0 v 1 to 4 v 5/7 .5 mL whole blood ) were associated with higher rate of PSA response ( three categories ; P = .036 ) in 39 evaluable patients .,3
"IGF-IR biomarkers were not correlated with PSA outcome , and cixutumumab did not significantly change these biomarker levels .",3
Cixutumumab plus AD did not significantly increase the undetectable PSA rate in men with new metastatic hormone-sensitive prostate cancer .,4
CTCs at baseline may carry prognostic value .,4
A total of 618 females and 1119 males were followed for 6452 person-years ; 19 new melanoma cases were observed .,3
The expected number was 5.29 .,3
"The standardized event ratio compared to the general population was 3.6 ( 95 % confidence interval , 2.2-5 .6 ) .",3
The risk for developing melanoma was higher than expected in the NET-PD LS-1 cohort and was similar to the risk reported in earlier comparable clinical trial cohorts .,4
Dermatologic screening may be useful in Parkinson 's disease to identify melanoma at an early stage .,4
"The TENSION trial will answer the question whether an endoscopic step-up approach reduces the combined primary endpoint of death and major complications , as well as hospital stay and related costs compared with a surgical step-up approach in patients with infected necrotising pancreatitis .",4
Sixty patients were allocated randomly to receive intravenous patient-controlled analgesia with morphine alone ( M ) or morphine plus remifentanil ( MR ) in a double-blind manner .,3
Patients were allowed to use bolus doses of morphine ( 0.02 mg/kg ) or the same dose of a morphine plus remifentanil ( 0.2 g/kg ) mixture every 10 minutes without a background infusion .,3
"VAS scores were lower in the MR group than in the M group at 30 minutes ( p = 0.04 ) , 1 hour ( p = 0.03 ) , and 2 hours ( p = 0.04 ) .",3
Mean cumulative doses of morphine were not significantly different at 27.815 mg for the M group and 21.910.5 mg for the MR group .,3
Significantly more patients needed meperidine in the M group ( p = 0.039 ) ; these also experienced more nausea ( p = 0.01 ) .,3
"Coadministration of PCA remifentanil with morphine for the treatment of post-thoracotomy pain did not reduce morphine consumption but provided superior analgesia , less use of rescue analgesics , and fewer side effects compared to morphine alone .",4
Subjects in group 1 had statistically significantly lower PI scores than did subjects in group 2 at six months .,3
"However , no differences in BOP , PPD , GR and CAL were observed between groups at any of the time points evaluated .",3
"Nonetheless , while full-mouth BOP and PPD scores progressively decreased over time in group 1 , the same parameters were significantly reduced at 3 months in group 2 , but remained stable thereafter .",3
"The proportion of moderate and deep pockets decreased progressively over time in the group of monthly recalls , while the proportion of moderate to deep sites decreased significantly in group 2 only at 3 months ; no additional reductions were seen at 6 months .",3
Supportive periodontal therapy both at one - and three-month intervals promotes short-term stability of clinical improvements obtained after full-mouth ultrasonic debridement in patients with chronic periodontitis .,4
"Mothers in the intervention group reported better longitudinal development of child-related stress than mothers of preterm controls , as they perceived their children as being more adaptable and less moody throughout childhood until the age of seven .",3
"Less stress in the intervention group was revealed by cross-sectional analysis of maternal reports at all ages , while fathers reported similar differences at ages three and five .",3
Parents in the intervention group reported stronger agreement on several stress scores on several occasions .,3
Fathers with high interventional participation ( mean 54 % ) reported significantly less stress at age nine than those who participated less .,3
"Both parents in the intervention group reported levels of stress similar to those experienced by the term reference group at all follow-ups , while differences between the preterm control and term reference groups increased .",3
This early intervention reduces stress among parents of prematurely born children to a level reported by parents of term-born children and enhances agreement between parents .,4
"174 individuals were screened ; because of slow recruitment , enrolment stopped with 136 of a planned 345 participants and 93 were randomly assigned to receive Vacc-4x and 43 to receive placebo .",3
There were no differences between the two groups for the primary efficacy endpoints in those participants who stopped cART at week 28 .,3
"Of the participants who resumed cART , 30 ( 34 % ) were in the Vacc-4x group and 11 ( 29 % ) in the placebo group , and percentage changes in CD4 counts were not significant ( mean treatment difference -571 , 95 % CI -1301 to 159 ) .",3
"However , a significant difference in viral load was noted for the Vacc-4x group both at week 48 ( median 23,100 copies per mL Vacc-4x vs 71,800 copies per mL placebo ; p = 0025 ) and week 52 ( median 19,550 copies per mL vs 51,000 copies per mL ; p = 0041 ) .",3
"One serious adverse event , exacerbation of multiple sclerosis , was reported as possibly related to study treatment .",3
"Vacc-4x was immunogenic , inducing proliferative responses in both CD4 and CD8 T-cell populations .",3
The proportion of participants resuming cART before end of study and change in CD4 counts during the treatment interruption showed no benefit of vaccination .,4
"Vacc-4x was safe , well tolerated , immunogenic , seemed to contribute to a viral-load setpoint reduction after cART interruption , and might be worth consideration in future HIV-cure investigative strategies .",4
"According to the clinicopathologic analyses , the incidence of extrathyroidal extension was higher in the patients with a tumor originating in the isthmus than in the control group ( p = 0.026 ) .",3
"According to the imaging analyses , the tumors originating in the isthmus more frequently had a circumscribed margin ( p = 0.030 ) , a wider-than-tall shape ( p < 0.001 ) , and the suspicion of extrathyroidal extension ( p < 0.001 ) than those originating from the lobes .",3
The results of this study showed that PTCs originating in the isthmus were more likely to have extrathyroidal extension than those originating from the lobes .,4
"Therefore , careful ultrasound evaluation should be performed on masses in the thyroid isthmus even if ultrasound shows a circumscribed mass with a wider-than-tall shape .",4
"At 4-year median follow-up , 244 patients had experienced relapse , 198 of whom were fully evaluable for review .",3
Those who progressed during treatment ( n = 30 ) or lacked relapse imaging ( n = 16 ) were excluded .,3
The median time to relapse was 12.8 months .,3
"Of the 198 evaluable patients , 30 % were RER/no CR , 26 % were SER , 26 % were RER/CR/no IFRT , 16 % were RER/CR/IFRT , and 2 % remained uncategorized .",3
"The 74 % and 75 % relapses involved initially bulky and nonbulky sites , respectively .",3
First relapses rarely occurred at exclusively new or out-of-field sites .,3
"By contrast , relapses usually occurred at nodal sites of initial bulky and nonbulky disease .",3
"Although response-based therapy has helped define treatment for selected RER patients , it has not improved outcome for SER patients or facilitated refinement of IFRT volumes or doses .",4
The baseline clinical data and angiographic features among 3 groups were similar ( all P > 0.05 ) .,3
The time of pain to balloon was ( 5.5 3.8 ) hours .,3
"After primary PCI , myocardial tissue perfusion was significantly better in Group C than in Group A and Group B : TMP grade < 3 [ 10.0 % ( 3/30 ) vs. 40.0 % ( 12/30 ) and 33.3 % ( 10/30 ) , P < 0.01 and P < 0.05 ] .",3
Left ventricular ejection fraction at 5 to 7 days after PCI also tended higher in Group C than in the other 2 groups ( P = 0.05 ) .,3
"One patient died of heart failure at 7th day after PCI in Group A , and no patient died in Group B and C. Thirty days after PCI , there was no re-myocardial infarction and target vessel revascularization event among 3 groups .",3
The bleeding complication rate during 30 days follow-up was similar among 3 groups ( P > 0.05 ) .,3
Intracoronary bolus application of tirofiban combined with nitroprusside through thrombus aspiration catheter after thrombus aspiration is associated with an improvement of myocardial reperfusion without increasing bleeding complication and other adverse cardiovascular events rate compared with thrombus aspiration alone in patients with acute anterior myocardial infarction and heavy thrombosis burden undergoing primary PCI .,4
There is an urgent need to identify treatments that will acutely decrease suicidal ideation and/or suicidal behavior .,4
The results of this study will demonstrate whether lithium reduces suicidal ideation and behavior within the first 5weeks of treatment .,4
"In the affected hemisphere , corticomotor excitability was significantly higher , cortical silent period and LTP-like plasticity significantly lower , compared to the contralateral side .",3
"No significant difference emerged for motor learning , cortical thickness and white matter integrity between the hemispheres .",3
"Despite decreased LTP-like plasticity in the affected hemisphere , motor learning was comparable between hemispheres , possibly due to gamma-aminobutyric-acid ( GABA ) B-mediated corticomotor excitability changes within the affected hemisphere .",4
Our results may help to develop interventions to beneficially modulate cortical physiology in the presence of cerebral hypoperfusion .,4
"Morphine consumption was significant higher in 0 mg ITM group ( control ) than other groups , but there was no difference between ITM groups .",3
"Pain score was significant lower in 0.3 mg ITM group compared to 0 mg at 1 hour ( 0.5 vs. 3.5 , respectively ; p-value = 0.013 ) and 4 hour ( 1.5 vs. 4.5 , respectively ; p-value = 0.037 ) postoperative period Side effects were not different in all groups .",3
"The present study concluded that , low-dose ITM combination with SSFNB provided good pain relief with low side effects and reduced morphine consumption during the first 24 hours post TKA .",4
Sixty-eight patients were enrolled in the study .,3
Distal waves mean amplitude increased significantly only during anodal tDCS in NERD ( p = 0.00002 ) and FH subgroups ( p = 0.008 ) while percentage of pathological waves strongly decreased only in NERDs ( p = 0.002 ) .,3
Transcranial stimulation can influence cortical control of esophageal motility and improve pathological motor pattern in NERD and FH but not in erosive reflux disease ( ERD ) patients .,4
Pathophysiological processes in GERD are not only due to peripheral damage but to central neural control involvement as well .,4
In ERD patients dysfunctions of the cortico-esophageal circuit seem to be more severe and may affect central nervous system physiology .,4
"The insulin sensitivity allele score ( GS-InSens ) was positively associated with spontaneous postnatal weight gain ( regression coefficient [ B ] : 0.12 SD scores per allele ; 95 % confidence interval [ CI ] , 0.01-0 .23 ; P = .03 ) and also in response to GH therapy with first-year height velocity ( B : 0.18 cm/y per allele ; 95 % CI , 0.02-0 .35 ; P = .03 ) and change in IGF-1 ( B : 0.17 SD scores per allele ; 95 % CI , 0.00-0 .32 ; P = .03 ) .",3
The association with first-year height velocity was independent of reported predictors of response to GH therapy ( adjusted P = .04 ) .,3
"The insulin secretion allele score ( GS-InSec ) was positively associated with spontaneous postnatal height gain ( B : 0.15 ; 95 % CI , 0.01-0 .30 ; P = .03 ) and disposition index both before ( B : 0.02 ; 95 % CI , 0.00-0 .04 ; P = .04 ) and after 1 year of GH therapy ( B : 0.03 ; 95 % CI , 0.01-0 .05 ; P = .002 ) , but not with growth and IGF-1 responses to GH therapy .",3
Neither of the allele scores was associated with size at birth .,3
Genetic allele scores indicative of insulin sensitivity and insulin secretion were associated with spontaneous postnatal growth and responses to GH therapy in short SGA children .,4
Further pharmacogenetic studies may support the rationale for adjuvant therapies by informing the mechanisms of treatment response .,4
"At Week 24 , the mean improvement in the WSRS compared with baseline was 1.87 0.73 for the PP-501-B side and 1.92 0.71 for the Restylane Perlane side .",3
"Both fillers were well tolerated , and adverse reactions were mild .",3
"The new HA filler , PP-501-B , to the market , with suitable characteristics and ample safety profiles , will widen the selection of agents for physicians and patients because the purpose , area , and depth of filler injections vary .",4
"In the whole cohort , higher morning and diurnal cortisol levels were associated with impaired insulin sensitivity ( morning : P = 0.004 , r ( 2 ) = 0.24 ; diurnal : P = 0.02 , r ( 2 ) = 0.15 ) .",3
"Using mixed model analysis , there was no significant effect of group , time or sex on morning or diurnal cortisol levels .",3
A 10 % weight loss with a 25 % CR diet alone or with exercise did not impact morning or diurnal salivary cortisol levels .,4
"The mean HCV RNA at start , 2 and 4 weeks of treatment were 6.69 0.70 , 1.05 0.74 , 0.22 0.48 log10 IU/ml in the TVR-2250 group and 6.70 0.62 , 1.02 0.62 , 0.13 0.41 log10 IU/ml in the TVR-1500 group .",3
"The SVR rates were 85 % in both groups ( 35/41 and 34/40 , respectively ) .",3
There were no patients with viral breakthrough in either group .,3
"As for adverse effects , rash more than moderate and severe anemia with < 8.5 g/dl of hemoglobin were higher in the TVR-2250 group than in the TVR-1500 group ( p = 0.046 , p < 0.001 , respectively ) .",3
The increase in serum creatinine levels and decrease in estimated glomerular filtration rates were higher in the TVR-2250 group than in the TVR-1500 group .,3
"The lower dose of TVR ( 1500 mg/day ) can result in similar SVR rates and lower treatment-related adverse effects compared to the higher dose of TVR ( 2250 mg/day ) in triple therapy ( UMIN : 000007313 , 000007330 ) .",4
"Of participants dispensed opioid analgesic 52 % received acute treatment , 25 % episodic treatment and 23 % long-term treatment .",3
People dispensed opioid analgesics long-term had an average of 14.9 opioid analgesic prescriptions/year from 2.0 doctors compared with 1.5 prescriptions from 1.1 doctors for people receiving acute treatment .,3
People dispensed opioid analgesics reported more need-related factors such as poorer physical functioning and higher psychological distress .,3
Long-term users were more likely to have access-related factors such as low-income and living outside major cities .,3
"After simultaneous adjustment , association with predisposing health factors and access diminished , but indicators of need such as osteoarthritis treatment , paracetamol use , and poor physical function were the strongest predictors for all opioid analgesic users .",3
"People dispensed opioid analgesics were in poorer health , reported higher levels of distress and poorer functioning than people not receiving opioid analgesics .",4
"Varying dispensing profiles were evident among people dispensed opioid analgesics for persistent pain , with those receiving episodic and long-term treatment dispensed the strongest opioid analgesics .",4
The findings highlight the broad range of factors associated with longer term opioid analgesics use .,4
"Composite of death/congestive heart failure/cardiogenic shock/myocardial infarction in PI and P-PCI arms occurred in 10.6 % versus 10.3 % ( 55min , p = 0.910 ) ; 13.9 % versus 17.9 % ( > 55-97min , p = 0.148 ) and 13.5 % versus 16.2 % ( > 97min , p = 0.470 ) , respectively .",3
"While there was no worsening of outcomes for PI across the P-RD spectrum , this occurred in the P-PCI arm ( p ( trend ) = 0.038 ) .",3
"For P-RD 55min , fewer events tended to occur with P-PCI than PI .",3
"Conversely , as P-RD increased to > 55min , PI-assigned patients had better outcomes than P-PCI , suggesting an event-free advantage with PI as P-RD increased ( p ( interaction ) = 0.094 ) .",3
Analysing P-RD continuously showed that for every 10-min increment there was an increasing trend towards benefit among PI-assigned patients ( p ( interaction ) = 0.073 ) .,3
"As P-RD increased , PI outcomes became superior to P-PCI when P-RD is prolonged and exceeds guideline-mandated times .",4
"In such circumstances , a PI strategy may provide an alternative reperfusion option .",4
Adverse time delays for delivery of P-PCI should be considered when evaluating reperfusion strategies .,4
"There were 48 patients in the group with tamponade , and 52 patients were left without tamponade .",3
"The trial 's primary outcome and maximum pain intensity , averaged 6.1 and 4.2 in the two groups ( P = 0.001 ) .",3
"In the group with tamponade , a complication was recorded in seven patients ( 15 % ) , which was similar to the group without tamponade ( 21 % ) .",3
"Severe anal bleeding occurred in two and five patients , respectively .",3
Bandage changes were less necessary often in the group treated without tamponade ( P = 0.013 ) .,3
Hospital stay was 4 days in both groups .,3
Data indicate that insertion of an anal tampon after haemorrhoidectomy does not reduce postoperative bleeding but causes significantly more pain .,4
"After haemorrhoidectomy , anal tampons should not be used routinely but may be considered when specific indications justify its use .",4
"Included participants showed decreased heart rate and negative mood , and increased social self-esteem .",3
No inclusion-related change in positive mood was shown .,3
An increase in heart rate was observed in excluded participants though no changes in negative/positive mood or social self-esteem were shown .,3
Shifts in social self-esteem acted as a mechanism through which inclusion/exclusion impacted upon negative and positive mood alterations .,3
"Results remained significant in presence of covariates ( sex , global self-esteem , rumination and social anxiety ) .",3
Findings suggest that acting to enhance belonging through ` inclusion ' resulted in adaptive physiological and psychological outcomes .,4
Neutral and potentially protective responses were observed in the immediate aftermath of ` exclusion ' .,4
Self-esteem served as one route through which these effects were transmitted .,4
A total of 2056 patients ( 41 % with a baseline CD4 + count of 500 cells per cubic millimeter ) were followed for 4757 patient-years .,3
"A total of 204 primary end-point events were observed ( 3.8 events per 100 person-years ; 95 % confidence interval [ CI ] , 3.3 to 4.4 ) , including 68 in patients with a baseline CD4 + count of at least 500 cells per cubic millimeter ( 3.2 events per 100 person-years ; 95 % CI , 2.4 to 4.0 ) .",3
"Tuberculosis and invasive bacterial diseases accounted for 42 % and 27 % of primary end-point events , respectively .",3
"The risk of death or severe HIV-related illness was lower with early ART than with deferred ART ( adjusted hazard ratio , 0.56 ; 95 % CI , 0.41 to 0.76 ; adjusted hazard ratio among patients with a baseline CD4 + count of 500 cells per cubic millimeter , 0.56 ; 95 % CI , 0.33 to 0.94 ) and lower with IPT than with no IPT ( adjusted hazard ratio , 0.65 ; 95 % CI , 0.48 to 0.88 ; adjusted hazard ratio among patients with a baseline CD4 + count of 500 cells per cubic millimeter , 0.61 ; 95 % CI , 0.36 to 1.01 ) .",3
The 30-month probability of grade 3 or 4 adverse events did not differ significantly among the strategies .,3
"In this African country , immediate ART and 6 months of IPT independently led to lower rates of severe illness than did deferred ART and no IPT , both overall and among patients with CD4 + counts of at least 500 cells per cubic millimeter .",4
"( Funded by the French National Agency for Research on AIDS and Viral Hepatitis ; TEMPRANO ANRS 12136 ClinicalTrials.gov number , NCT00495651 . )",4
An evening dose of 500 mg acetazolamide reduced slow-wave activity ( SWA ; approximately 10 % ) and increased spindle activity ( approximately 10 % ) during non-REM sleep .,3
"In addition , alpha activity during wake after lights out was increased .",3
An evening dose of 250 mg did not affect these cortical oscillations .,3
Discontinuation of CPAP therapy revealed a reduction in SWA ( 5-10 % ) and increase in beta activity ( approximately 25 % ) .,3
"The higher evening dose of 500 mg acetazolamide showed the `` spectral fingerprint '' of Benzodiazepines , while 250 mg acetazolamide had no impact on cortical oscillations .",4
"However , both doses had beneficial effects on oxygen saturation and sleep quality .",4
The risk of weaning before 12 months of age was significantly lower in the intervention group for adolescent mothers not living with their mothers ; whereas the risk was not statistically different between intervention and control groups for those living with their mothers .,3
The positive influence of systematic counseling sessions on the prevalence of breastfeeding in the first year of life was significant for adolescent mothers .,4
Living with their mothers reduced such influence .,4
"Rifampicin markedly increased exposures of both statins , with greater differential increases after POvs.IV rifampicin only for rosuvastatin .",3
"The magnitudes of the increases in area under the plasma concentration-time curve were 5.7 - and 7.6-fold for pitavastatin and 4.4 - and 3.3-fold for rosuvastatin , after PO and IV rifampicin , respectively .",3
"In vitro studies showed that rifampicin was an inhibitor of OATP1B1 and OATP1B3 , breast cancer resistance protein and multidrug resistance protein 2 , but not of organic anion transporter 3 .",3
"The results indicate that pitavastatin is a more sensitive and selective and thus preferred clinical OATP1B probe substrate than rosuvastatin , and that a single IV dose of rifampicin is a more selective OATP1B inhibitor than a PO dose .",4
"The blood eosinophil numbers , skin test index , rhinitis symptom scores and drug scores were all decreased significantly after the treatment with SIT for 3 years compared to that of ST group ( P < 0.01 ) .",3
"Although the level of serum slgE was decreased , no statistic diferences were found .",3
"No patients developed asthma in SIT group , and only 2.1 % of patients had new allergen sensitization ; 17.4 % of those in ST group developed asthma , 32.6 % had new sensitization .",3
No severe adverse events occurred .,3
"Keeping long-term SIT is effective and safe for patients with allergic rhinitis induced by mite , which can also prevent new allergen sensitization and development for asthma .",4
"Patients with persisting PSA after RP had higher preoperative PSA values , higher tumor stages , higher Gleason scores , and more positive surgical margins than did patients in arms A + B. For the 74 patients , the 10-year clinical relapse-free survival rate was 63 % .",3
Forty-three men had hormone therapy ; 12 experienced distant metastases ; 23 patients died .,3
"Compared with men who did achieve an undetectable PSA , the arm-C patients fared significantly worse , with a 10-year metastasis-free survival of 67 % versus 83 % and overall survival of 68 % versus 84 % , respectively .",3
"In Cox regression analysis , Gleason score 8 ( hazard ratio [ HR ] 2.8 ) , pT 3c ( HR 2.4 ) , and extraprostatic extension 2 mm ( HR 3.6 ) were unfavorable risk factors of progression .",3
A persisting PSA after prostatectomy seems to be an important prognosticator of clinical progression for pT3 tumors .,4
It correlates with a higher rate of distant metastases and with worse overall survival .,4
A larger prospective study is required to determine which patient subgroups will benefit most from which treatment option .,4
Severity of knee pain decreased in both groups after intervention .,3
"The mean difference in groups A ( laterally wedged insole ) and B ( neutrally wedged insole ) were 29.3 ( 95 % confidence interval [ 95 % CI ] : 25.12 , 33.55 ) and 6.25 ( 95 % CI : 3.09 , 9.4 ) , respectively ( P < 0.001 for both ) .",3
"In addition , at the end of the study , EKFS improved significantly in group A ( mean : 7.54 , 95 % CI : 6.3 , 8.8 ; P < 0.001 ) , while in group B we could not find significant improvement ( mean : 0.54 , 95 % CI : -0.41 , 1.5 ; P = 0.166 ) .",3
"Numbers of NSAIDs used during the two final weeks of the study significantly decreased compared with baseline in group A ( P = 0.001 ; mean : 2.6 , 95 % CI : 1.3 , 3.9 ) ; while in group B this was not shown ( P = 0.9 ; mean : 0.05 , 95 % CI : -0.87 , 0.97 ) .",3
"This study suggests that laterally elevated wedged insoles are more effective than neutrally wedged insoles , in pain relief of knee OA .",4
"The groups were similar with regard to age , weight , height , body mass index , Cobb angle , and distribution of Lenke classifications .",3
"No differences were noted in anesthesia time , surgery time , intraoperative fluids , or estimated blood loss between the 2 groups .",3
"Time to eye opening , time to following commands , and time to tracheal extubation were shorter in the volatile anesthesia group than the total intravenous anesthesia group .",3
No clinically significant difference was noted in the amplitude or latency of somatosensory evoked potential monitoring .,3
"Although statistically significantly greater voltage amplitude was required to generate a motor evoked potential , the voltage amount was within a clinically acceptable range .",3
Our data demonstrate that a volatile agent-based anesthetic regimen is feasible even during neurophysiological monitoring .,4
Advantages include a more rapid awakening and the feasibility of a rapid wake-up test ( < 5 min ) in the event that irreversible changes in neurophysiological monitoring are noted .,4
The mean ( SD ) cumulative opioid consumption 48hours postoperatively was 249.3 ( 143.3 ) mg in the NS group and 184.7 ( 208.1 ) mg in the LA group ( mean difference 64.6 mg ; 95 % confidence interval -54.3 to 183.5 ; P = 0.27 ) .,3
There were no adverse events in either group .,3
Continuous epidural infusion combined with systemic multimodal analgesia resulted in a mean reduction in 48-hr cumulative opioid consumption of 64.6 mg ( 95 % confidence interval -54.3 to 183.5 ) following one - or two-level lumbar spinal fusion .,4
"This estimate of effect is imprecise , and the routine use of continuous epidural analgesia in this surgical population is not yet warranted .",4
This trial was registered at www.clinicaltrials.gov : NCT00644111 .,4
"The main triggering factor , as well as the worsening of pain , was the patient manipulation , both with a prevalence of 34.9 % .",3
"The main treatment for low back pain before this research was the use of medication , with a prevalence of 44.2 % .",3
"In accordance with a variance analysis , only G1 presented a significant statistical difference , with a better result after 12 sessions .",3
"Massage presented an enormous effect ( d = 4.59 ) , corresponding to 86 % of reduction in the pain level .",3

"Post-prandial oxidative stress and endothelial dysfunction were investigated in twenty-five healthy subjects who were randomly allocated in a cross-over design to a Mediterranean diet added with or without extra virgin olive oil ( EVOO , 10g ) ( first study , n = 25 ) or Mediterranean diet with EVOO ( 10g ) or corn oil ( 10g ) ( second study , n = 25 ) .",3
"Oxidative stress biomarkers including platelet reactive oxidant species ( ROS ) and 8-iso-PGF2-III , activity of NOX2 , the catalytic sub-unit of NADPH oxidase , as assessed in platelets and serum , serum vitamin E and endothelial dysfunction , were measured before and 2h after lunch .",3
"In the first study a significant increase of platelet ROS , 8-iso-PGF2-III , NOX2 activity , sE-selectin , sVCAM1 and a decrease of serum vitamin E were detected in controls but not when EVOO was included in the Mediterranean diet ; oxidative stress and endothelial dysfunction increase were also observed in the second study in subjects given corn oil .",3
A significant correlation was found between NOX2 activity and platelet oxidative stress .,3
Invitro study demonstrated that EVOO but not corn oil significantly decreased platelet and PMNs oxidative stress and NOX2 activity .,3
The study provides the first evidence that post-prandial oxidative stress may be triggered by NOX2 up-regulation .,4
"EVOO but not corn oil , is able to counteract such phenomenon suggesting that addition of EVOO to a Mediterranean diet protects against post-prandial oxidative stress .",4
"The mean age of patients was 35.20 years ( SD 10.43 ) ( 28 male , 44 female ) , 39 % ( 28/72 ) were male , and patients had been diagnosed with type 1 diabetes for a mean of 18.94 years ( SD 9.66 ) .",3
"Of the initial 72 patients , 53 completed the study ( 25 intervention , 28 control group ) .",3
"The intervention group significantly improved glycemic control ( HbA1c ) from baseline ( mean 9.08 % , SD 1.18 ) to 9-month follow-up ( mean 7.80 % , SD 0.75 ) , compared to the control group ( baseline : mean 8.47 % , SD 0.86 , follow-up : mean 8.58 % , SD 1.16 ) .",3
"No significant change over time was found in either group in relation to self-efficacy , self-care activities , and quality of life .",3
"In adjunct to usual care , the use of a diabetes-related smartphone application combined with weekly text-message support from a health care professional can significantly improve glycemic control in adults with type 1 diabetes .",4
"The number of intubations requiring 2 or more intubation attempts was similar in the 2 groups ( 14 % control vs 13 % intervention , P = 1.0 ) ; the number of patients requiring 3 or more intubation attempts was not significantly different ( 8.6 % control vs 1.4 % intervention , P = 0.12 ) .",3
"Distribution for time to intubation also did not differ between the control ( median of 66 seconds , interquartile range 47-89 ) and the intervention group ( median of 71 seconds , interquartile range 52-100 ; P = 0.35 ) .",3
"In the control group , 4 patients , all with cervical spine pathology , had the trachea intubated successfully with the video laryngoscope plus flexible tracheoscope after 3 failed attempts with video laryngoscope and rigid stylet .",3
"For these 4 patients , time from the decision to change the intubation method to successful intubation with a flexible tracheoscope was 36 14 seconds .",3
"Overall success probability for cervical spine patients was 100 % ( 20/20 ) in the intervention group and 80 % ( 16/20 ) in the control group , with an exact 95 % confidence interval for the difference of 1.4 % to 44 % , P = 0.04 .",3
Flexible tracheoscope-assisted video laryngoscopic intubation is a feasible alternative to video laryngoscope only intubation in patients with predicted difficult airways .,4
"A flexible tracheoscope used in combination with video laryngoscope may also further increase the success rate of intubation in select patients with a proven difficult airway , particularly when in-line stabilization is required .",4
Patients with higher risk MDS or with AML aged 60 years were eligible .,3
Patients were randomized in a Bayesian response-adaptive design to receive intravenous decitabine 20 mg/m ( 2 ) daily for 5 days or decitabine plus oral valproic acid 50 mg/kg daily for 7 days .,3
Courses were repeated every 4 to 6 weeks .,3
A maximum of 150 patients were to be treated .,3
"In total , 149 patients were treated on study , including 87 patients with MDS and 62 patients with AML .",3
"The median patient age was 69 years ( range , 20-89 years ; 42 % of patients were aged 70 years ) .",3
"Overall , 34 % of patients achieved complete remission , and 55 % had an objective response .",3
"The median survival was 11.9 months , and the estimated 2-year survival rate was 27 % .",3
"Outcome was not different with the addition of valproic acid to decitabine versus decitabine alone in relation to the rates of complete remission , overall response , or survival .",3
Subset analyses did not demonstrate a benefit within the MDS or AML categories .,3
Toxicities-particularly neurotoxicities-were higher with the combination arm .,3
Adding valproic acid to decitabine was not associated with improved outcome in the treatment of patients with MDS or elderly patients with AML .,4
Future therapies may consider combining hypomethylating agents with better HDAC inhibitors and using different schedules .,4
"The mean peak inflation pressure was higher in synchronized intermittent mandatory ventilation group ( p < 0.001 ) and the mean airway pressure was higher in pressure support ventilation with volume guarantee group ( p = 0.03 ) , whereas mean tidal volume and respiratory rates were similar in both groups .",3
"The prevalence of postextubation atelectasis was higher in synchronized intermittent mandatory ventilation group , but the difference was not statistically significant ( p = 0.08 ) .",3
"No differences were found in the prevalence of reintubation , patent ductus arteriosus , intraventricular hemorrhage , retinopathy of prematurity , bronchopulmonary dysplasia , and pneumothorax between the groups .",3
Pressure support ventilation with volume guarantee mode may be a safe and feasible mode during the weaning phase of very low-birth weight infants on mechanical ventilation support for respiratory distress syndrome with respect to reducing the frequency of postextubation atelectasis and using less peak inflation pressure .,4
The study adopts a mixed methods approach encompassing a broad range of outcome measures .,3
"The results will be obtained from the following primary outcome measures : Manchester Low Vision Questionnaire , capturing device ` usage ' data ( which devices are used , number of times , for what purposes , and for how long ) and the MNRead test , measuring threshold print size , critical print size , and acuity reserve in addition to reading speed at high ( 90 % ) contrast .",3
Results will also be obtained from a series of secondary outcome measures which include : assessment of timed instrumental activities of daily living and a ` near vision ' visual functioning questionnaire .,3
"A companion qualitative study will permit comparison of results on how , where , and under what circumstances , p-EVES devices and LVAs are used in daily life .",3
A health economic evaluation will provide results on : the incremental cost-effectiveness of p-EVES compared to optical magnifiers ; cost-effectiveness ; and cost-utility .,3
The evidence base in low vision rehabilitation is modest and further high quality clinical trials are required to inform decisions on healthcare provision .,4
"The p-EVES study findings are anticipated to contribute to this broader evidence requirement , with the methodological issues evident here being relevant to other trials within the field .",4
Radial access increased from 4.9 % in the first quarter of 2009 to 11.9 % in the last quarter of 2010 .,3
"Significant independent predictors were higher body surface area , non-Hispanic ethnicity , Caucasian race , stable hemodynamic state , ejection fraction < 30 % and 50 % onset of STEMI from 12to 23 h before the index procedure , and peripheral vascular disease .",3
"Mortality was not related to access site after adjustment for covariates ( for radial vs. femoral access , adjusted odds ratio : 0.86 , 95 % confidence interval : 0.59 to 1.25 ) , but the radial access site was trending toward lower mortality for the 9 hospitals that used it for more than 10 % of their patients ( adjusted odds ratio : 0.61 , 95 % confidence interval : 0.36 to 1.02 ) .",3
"The use of a radial access site for PCI in STEMI patients increased between 2009 and 2010 , but was still infrequent in 2010 , and was used for lower-risk STEMI patients .",4
"There was no significant difference in mortality by access site , but there was a trend toward a mortality advantage for patients with a radial access site among hospitals that used it relatively frequently .",4
"At screening for the efficacy study , 99 % of patients were found to have lamivudine resistance .",3
"Prior exposure to entecavir or entecavir resistance was observed in 12 % of patients , and 22 % of patients had been previously exposed to adefovir ; 1.8 % were resistant to adefovir .",3
"Only 18 patients ( 6.4 % ) qualified for sequence analysis , including 1 patient who experienced virologic breakthrough and 17 with persistent viremia .",3
"Six of these patients did not have any sequence changes from baseline in HBV reverse transcriptase ( 33 % ) , and sequence analysis could not be performed for 5 patients ( 28 % ) .",3
"In 2 patients who qualified for phenotypic analysis ( 1 given TDF and 1 given FTC/TDF ) , no resistance to TDF was observed .",3
Neither previous treatment exposure nor resistance to entecavir or adefovir affected viral kinetics .,3
"However , the mean baseline level of HBV DNA was significantly higher in viremic patients than in patients with viral suppression by week 96 ( 7.28 log10 IU/mL vs 5.62 log10 IU/mL ; P = .0003 ) .",3
No resistance to TDF was detected through 96 weeks of treatment in patients with lamivudine-resistant chronic hepatitis B. Prior treatment or resistance to entecavir or adefovir did not affect viral kinetics through 96 weeks .,4

The changes in the observation group were more obvious than those in the control group ( all P < 0.05 ) .,3
"On the basis of the conventional medication and rehabilitation training , EA improves the metabolism of brain tissue and memory function of the patients .",4
The efficacy of this therapy is better than that of medication combined with rehabilitation training .,4
10 patients were enrolled .,3
There is no difference between the control group and an experimental group .,3
In this study there is no cardio-inhibition vasovagal syncope .,3
Positive tilt table test occurred in 50 % of the patients receiving G-suited and 100 % in control group ( p 0.133 ) .,3
G-suit is unable to prevent syncope in patients with positive tilt table test but the result is not statistically significant .,4

The average reduction in the errors was 7.3 .,3
This study confirmed that the use of the PC feature improved localization for sounds arriving from behind the listener .,4
The use of IE may improve localization for some listeners for sounds arriving from the sides .,4
"We found no evidence that personal experiences evoked more responses ( mean 3.79 , SD 3.91 ) from other members of the Internet forums than fact-oriented contributions ( mean 2.14 , SD 2.93 , t26 = 0.126 , P = .219 ) .",3
"But personal experiences elicited emotional replies ( mean 3.17 , SD 1.29 ) from other users to a greater extent than fact-oriented contributions ( mean 2.13 , SD 1.29 , t81 = 3.659 , P < .001 ) .",3
We suggest that personal experiences elicited more emotional replies due to the process of emotional anchoring of people 's own style of communication .,4
"We recommend future studies should aim at testing the hypotheses with more general and with less emotionally charged topics , constructing different fact-oriented posts , and examining additional potential factors of influence such as personality factors or particular communication situations .",4
We enrolled and analysed a total of 731 patients over a 15-month period .,3
At least one adenoma was found in 159 ( 43.8 % ) of 363 patients by nurse endoscopists and 120 ( 32.7 % ) of 367 patients by medical endoscopists and a proportion difference of +11.1 % compared with the medical endoscopists ( 95 % CI 4.1 % to 18.1 % ) .,3
"The withdrawal time was , however , significantly longer among nurses ( 998 vs 575 s , p < 0.001 ) .",3
"After adjusting for differences in a regression analysis , colonoscopy by nurses was associated with a lower adenoma detection rate ( OR 0.475 : 95 % CI 0.311 to 0.725 ) .",3
"Nurse endoscopists had a lower caecal intubation rate ( 97.3 % vs 100 % ) , received better pain and satisfaction scores and had a high rate of patient acceptance .",3
"In this pragmatic trial , nurses can perform screening colonoscopy but require a longer procedural time to achieve a comparable adenoma detection rate as medical endoscopists .",4

The use of a 0.05 mmol/kg dose of gadobenate dimeglumine is feasible for LGE imaging of acute MI and the best image quality is obtained at 5 min after contrast administration .,4
"It could be beneficial in patient with renal failure and a solution to improve the identification of subendocardial infarction reducing examination time , costs and total gadolinium load .",4
"However , the standard dose of 0.1 mmol/kg provides overall better image quality , with the best performance obtained at the delay of 10 min or more after Gd-BOPTA administration , and it should be routinely preferred .",4
"The most frequent symptoms of constipation evaluated by the Roma III criteria at baseline were comparable among the groups and included `` incomplete evacuation '' ( 92 % ) , `` lumpy or hard stools , '' ( 72 % ) and `` anorectal obstruction '' ( 70 % ) .",3
"The Rome III score improved significantly in patients receiving mineral oil ( 10.55.0 to 4.14.0 ; P < .01 ) , olive oil ( 10.34.2 to 3.23.8 ; P = .01 ) , and flaxseed oil ( 9.64.2 to 6.05.1 ; P < .01 ) , with no significant group-by-time interaction ( P = .15 ) .",3
"The scores of 5 from 6 constipation symptoms reduced similarly in the mineral oil and olive oil groups , whereas only the frequency of evacuation and the consistency of stools improved in the flaxseed oil group .",3

Thirty-three patients ( 53.23 % ) were randomly assigned to the HCEC group and 29 patients were randomly assigned to the UC group .,3
"Among the 33 patients in the HCEC group , two ( 6.06 % ) of them ultimately did not receive a HCEC service .",3
"Among the 29 patients in the UC group , four ( 13.79 % ) of them received a HCEC service .",3
The survival rate at hospital discharge did not differ between the two groups .,3
Patients in the HCEC group showed significant reductions in the entire ICU stay and entire hospital stay .,3
HCEC significantly facilitated achieving the goal of medical care ( p < .01 ) .,3
"Furthermore , patients in the HCEC group had a shorter ICU stay and shorter hospital stay after the occurrence of medical uncertainty or conflict regarding value-laden issues than those in the UC group .",3
"Our findings demonstrated that HCEC were associated with reduced consumption of medical resources as indicated by shorter entire ICU stay , entire hospital stay , and shorter ICU and hospital stay after the occurrence of the medical uncertainty or conflict regarding value-laden issues .",4
"This study also showed that HCEC facilitated achieving a consensus regarding the goal of medical care , which conforms to the goal of HCEC .",4
"The endoscopic remission induction rate from the attending physicians ' evaluations was 82.8 % in the mesalazine suppository group and 31.1 % in the placebo suppository group , whereas the respective rates from the central review committee were 90.6 % and 59.0 % .",3
"However , there was a difference of 27.9 percentage points between the remission induction rates of the placebo group found by the two groups of raters .",3
Differences in the evaluations of mucosal finding scores were also found among the third-party reviewers .,3
The evaluations of the attending physicians were consistent with those of the central review committee in showing the effectiveness of mesalazine suppository through the index of mucosal healing .,4
"However , differences were observed among the raters in their evaluations of mucosal finding scores .",4
"Therefore , standardizing evaluation criteria and improving review methods for mucosal findings would enable the more effective use of third-party central reviews in clinical drug trials .",4

"However , the intermittent infusion system usage in underweight children should be considered , due to the lower volume of infused heparin solution [ ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier : NCT01097031 ] .",4
"Baseline total , LDL - , HDL - and non-HDL cholesterol and apolipoproteins A-I and B differed between sexes , and these and triacylglycerol levels improved with fenofibrate in both sexes ( all p < 0.001 ) .",3
"Fenofibrate reduced total , LDL - and non-HDL cholesterol and apolipoprotein B more in women ( all p < 0.001 ) , independent of menopausal status and statin uptake .",3
"Adjusted for covariates , fenofibrate reduced total cardiovascular outcomes ( cardiovascular death , fatal and non-fatal stroke and carotid and coronary revascularisation ) by 30 % in women ( 95 % CI 8 % , 46 % ; p = 0.008 ) and 13 % in men ( 95 % CI -1 % , 24 % ; p = 0.07 ) with no treatment-by-sex interaction ( p > 0.1 ) .",3
"In patients with high triacylglycerol levels and low HDL-cholesterol , fenofibrate reduced total cardiovascular outcomes by 30 % ( 95 % CI -7 % , 54 % ) in women and 24 % ( 95 % CI 2 % , 42 % ) in men , with no treatment-by-sex interaction ( p > 0.1 ) .",3
Fenofibrate improved the lipoprotein profile more in women than men .,4
"Cardiovascular event reductions with fenofibrate were consistently similar in women and men , both overall and among those with low HDL-cholesterol and high triacylglycerol levels .",4
These data provide reassurance about fenofibrate efficacy in women and men .,4
Both sexes with type 2 diabetes should be considered for fenofibrate therapy for cardioprotection .,4
"Average pain queried on POD 1 for subjects receiving perineural ropivacaine ( n = 30 ) was a median ( interquartile ) of 2 ( 0-3 ) , compared with 4 ( 1-5 ) for subjects receiving saline ( n = 30 ; 95 % confidence interval difference in medians , -4.0 to -0.3 ; P = 0.021 ] .",3
"During this same period , subjects receiving ropivacaine experienced a lower severity of breakthrough pain ( 5 [ 3-6 ] vs 7 [ 5-8 ] ; P = 0.046 ) as well .",3
"As a result , subjects receiving perineural ropivacaine experienced less pain-induced physical and emotional dysfunction , as measured with the Brief Pain Inventory ( lower score = less dysfunction ) : 14 ( 4-37 ) versus 57 ( 8-67 ) for subjects receiving perineural saline ( P = 0.012 ) .",3
"For the subscale that measures the degree of interference of pain on 7 domains , such as general activity and relationships , subjects receiving perineural saline reported a median score 10 times higher ( more dysfunction ) than those receiving ropivacaine ( 3 [ 0-24 ] vs 33 [ 0-44 ] ; P = 0.035 ) .",3
"In contrast , after infusion discontinuation , there were no statistically significant differences detected between treatment groups .",3
"After mastectomy , adding a multiple-day , ambulatory , continuous ropivacaine infusion to a single-injection ropivacaine paravertebral nerve block results in improved analgesia and less functional deficit during the infusion .",4
"However , no benefits were identified after infusion discontinuation .",4
"Twenty low-birthweight infants receiving 0.30.04 % supplemental oxygen on CPAP of 6 cm H2O were studied at an average of 33days of age ( 23days , SD ) .",3
"There were no differences in tcCO2 or other physiological parameters except mean blood pressure , which was lower during nCPAP ( 52.38.3 vs 54.49.1 mmHg ; SD ; p < 0.01 ) .",3
"No differences in short or prolonged apnoea , bradycardia or significant desaturation events were observed .",3
"At similar mean airway pressures , SiPAP does not improve CO2 removal , oxygenation or other studied physiological parameters with the exception of mean blood pressure , which was not clinically significant .",4
"The PACSLAC-II demonstrated satisfactory reliability , excellent validity , and ability to differentiate between pain and nonpain states .",3
"The PACSLAC-II also accounted for unique variance in differentiating between pain and nonpain states , even after controlling for the preexisting tools combined , including the PACSLAC .",3
"The PACSLAC-II was also preferred by many LTC nurses and care aides , because of its length and condensed nature , which was thought to facilitate documentation and greater efficiency in pain management .",3
"Findings indicate that the empirical and theoretically driven revisions to the PACSLAC led to improved ability to differentiate between pain and nonpain states , while retaining its clinical utility .",4
"Comparing LLP categorization between both observers , Cohen 's kappa coefficient was 0.615 and 0.633 for first and second session , respectively .",3
"When comparing LLP categorization by the same observer between both sessions , Cohen 's kappa coefficient was 0.770 and 0.812 for Observer 1 and Observer 2 , respectively .",3
These results indicate substantial correlation in all cases .,3
The most frequent misinterpretations were between open and closed meshwork and Wave and closed meshwork patterns .,3
"Although substantial correlation was found between categorizations of experienced observers , misinterpretation of the patterns may appear even in the same observer .",4
Some misinterpretations between adjacent patterns could be palliated by including intermediate patterns between those categories .,4
Neither HT nor raloxifene augmented loss of total or abdominal fat mass during exercise-induced weight loss when compared with placebo .,3
"Weight loss-induced improvements in risk factors were similar among the three groups , except for a greater reduction in fasted glucose in the HT group ( difference in change [ 95 % CI ] from placebo ; -0.40 [ -0.76 , -0.05 ] ) and greater reductions in LDL ( -0.36 [ -0.63 , -0.09 ] ) and increases in HDL ( 0.15 [ 0.07 , 0.24 ] ) in both treatment groups .",3
"Postmenopausal HT and raloxifene did not increase abdominal fat loss during weight loss , but did improve some cardiometabolic outcomes .",4
Rates of red blood cell-transfusion independence ( RBC-TI ) 182d were higher in the lenalidomide 10mg ( 57.4 % ; P < 0.0001 ) and 5mg ( 37.2 % ; P = 0.0001 ) groups vs. placebo ( 2.2 % ) .,3

"Overall , zinc supplementation improved birth length compared to placebo or combined vitamin A + zinc ( 48.8 vs. 48.5 cm , p = 0.04 ) ; vitamin A supplementation improved birth length compared to placebo or combined vitamin A + zinc ( 48.7 vs. 48.2 cm , p = 0.04 ) .",3
"These effects remained after adjusting for maternal height , pre-pregnancy weight , and parity .",3
"There was no effect of supplementation on birth weight , the proportion of low birth weight , neonatal morbidity , or mortality .",3
"Prenatal zinc or vitamin A supplementation demonstrates a small but significant effect on birth length , but supplementation with zinc , vitamin A or a combination of zinc and vitamin A , have no effect on birth weight , neonatal morbidity , or mortality .",4
"Between Nov 22 , 2013 , and Feb 25 , 2014 , we randomly assigned 42 participants to receive the low dose ( n = 12 ) , the medium dose ( n = 12 ) , or the high dose ( n = 12 ) of the measles-virus-based candidate vaccine , or Priorix ( n = 6 ) , of whom 36 participants ( 86 % ; n = 9 , n = 12 , n = 10 , n = 5 , respectively ) were included in the per-protocol population .",3
"The candidate vaccine raised neutralising antibodies in all dose cohorts after one immunisation , with seroconversion rates of 44 % ( n = 4 ) in the low-dose group , 92 % ( n = 11 ) in the medium-dose group , and 90 % ( n = 10 ) in the high-dose group .",3
The immunogenicity of the candidate vaccine was not affected by pre-existing anti-measles immunity .,3
The second vaccination resulted in a 100 % seroconversion for all participants in the candidate vaccine groups .,3
"The candidate vaccine had an overall good safety profile , and the rate of adverse events increased with vaccine dose and volume .",3
No vaccination-related serious adverse events were recorded .,3
"The live recombinant measles-virus-based chikungunya vaccine had good immunogenicity , even in the presence of anti-vector immunity , was safe , and had a generally acceptable tolerability profile .",4

"Total intubation time was significantly shorter in the TOC group ( mean 30.6 standard deviation 2.7 seconds versus 38.73.3 seconds , p < 0.0001 ) .",3
"T2 was also significantly shorter in the TOC group than the TOE group ( 27.22.5 seconds versus 34.93.0 seconds , p < 0.0001 ) .",3
"The severity of hoarseness on the first postoperative day and sore throat on the fourth postoperative day were significantly lower in the TOC group than the TOE group ( p = 0.02 and < 0.0001 , respectively ) .",3
The hemodynamic responses to intubation were broadly similar between the groups .,3
"When placing a left-sided DLT using a VL , angling the bronchial lumen to a hockey stick shape that conceals the tracheal lumen saves time and ameliorates the severity of post-intubation complications .",4
"Pain intensity , Oswestry Disability Index and flexion range of motion had shown significant differences before and after intervention in both groups ( p < 0.001 ) .",3
"The statistical analysis revealed that the massage therapy had significantly improved the pain intensity and Oswestry Disability Index compared to routine physical therapy ( p = 0.015 , p = 0.013 respectively ) , but the range of motion changes were not significant between two groups ( p = 1.00 ) .",3
It can be concluded that both massage therapy and routine physical therapy are useful for sub acute and chronic nonspecific low back pain treatment especially if accompanied with exercise .,4
"However , massage is more effective than other electrotherapy modalities , and it can be used alone or with electrotherapy for the treatment of patients with low back pain .",4
"In the albiglutide group , HbA1c declined from 8.280.90 % ( 67.09.8 mmol/mol ) ( meanSD ) at baseline to 7.621.12 % ( 59.812.2 mmol/mol ) at week 52 .",3
A similar reduction occurred in the insulin glargine group ( 8.360.95 % to 7.551.04 % [ 67.910.4 to 59.011.4 mmol/mol ] ) .,3
"The model-adjusted treatment difference of 0.11 % ( 95 % CI -0.04 % , 0.27 % ) ( 1.2 mmol/mol [ 95 % CI -0.4 , 3.0 mmol/mol ] ) indicated non-inferiority of albiglutide to insulin glargine based on the pre-specified non-inferiority margin of 0.3 % ( 3.3 mmol/mol , p = 0.0086 ) .",3
"Body weight increased in the insulin glargine group and decreased in the albiglutide group , with a mean treatment difference of -2.61 kg ( 95 % CI -3.20 , -2.02 ; p < 0.0001 ) .",3
"Documented symptomatic hypoglycaemia occurred in a higher proportion of patients in the insulin glargine group than in the albiglutide group ( 27.4 % vs 17.5 % , p = 0.0377 ) .",3
"Albiglutide was non-inferior to insulin glargine at reducing HbA1c at week 52 , with modest weight loss and less hypoglycaemia .",4
Both drugs were well tolerated .,4
Albiglutide may be considered an alternative to insulin glargine in this patient population .,4
"Though percentage of normal vaginal delivery was higher in Partogram group ( 71.5 % ) than no Partogram group ( 68 % ) , no statistically significant difference was found between two groups regarding mean duration of active phase of first and second stage of labour , rate of operative vaginal deliveries ( partogram 12 % and no partogram 12.5 % ) and of caesarean section ( Partogram 16.5 % , no Partogram 18.5 % ) and perinatal outcome .",3
"In this study , partogram had no significant impact on duration of labour , rate of operative interventions and perinatal outcome following its use in the labour management of high risk pregnancies .",4
"In comparison to the naked eye , the mean central keratometry flattened with both negative lens powers ( p < 0.05 in all cases ) , did not change with the +3.00 soft lens power ( p = 1.0 ) ; and steepened with the +6.00 soft lens power ( p = 0.02 ) .",3
Rigid gas-permeable over-refraction did not change significantly between different soft lens powers ( all p > 0.05 ) .,3
"RGP 's BOZR decreased significantly with both positive in comparison with both negative soft lens powers ( all p < 0.001 ) , but no significant differences were found among negative - or positive-powers separately ( both p > 0.05 ) .",3
"Estimated RGP 's final power increased significantly with positive in comparison with negative lens powers ( all p < 0.001 ) , but no significant differences were found among negative or positive lens powers separately ( both p > 0.05 ) .",3
Visual acuity did not change significantly between the different soft lens powers assessed ( all p > 0.05 ) .,3
The use of negative-powered soft lenses in piggyback fitting reduces RGP lens power without impacting VA in keratoconus subjects .,4
Steps to Growing Up Healthy will provide important information about whether a brief primary care-based intervention that utilizes a motivational interviewing and goal setting approach can be incorporated into routine care and is sufficient to prevent/reverse obesity in young children .,4
The study will also explore whether monthly contact with a community health worker bridges the gap between the clinic and the community and is an effective strategy for promoting obesity prevention in high-risk families .,4
Pretreatment expectations of the therapeutic alliance were significantly related to alliance later in therapy but did not differ across treatments and did not predict outcome .,3
Alliance development over time differed between treatments ; it increased more in SET than in PBO .,3
"After controlling for prior symptom improvement , early alliance predicted subsequent depression change .",3
"Expectations of alliance and of treatment outcome/improvement , measured prior to treatment onset , predicted subsequent alliance .",4
The implementation of IEOC resulted in increased emotion-oriented skills and more knowledge of the residents among the caregivers .,3
Providing IEOC was not more time consuming for the caregivers than providing usual care .,3
This study shows that the implementation of IEOC was effective .,4
It is recommended that in intervention studies the correct application of a new intervention or care approach is examined before jumping to conclusions about the effectiveness of the intervention or care approach itself .,4
"PUPS has been successfully implemented , including recruitment of the target sample size of 170 participants , assurance of the integrity of intervention protocol delivery with an average 90 % treatment adherence rate , and enactment of the assessment plan .",3
"However , implementation has been replete with challenges .",3
"To meet recruitment goals , we instituted a five-pronged approach customized for an underserved , ethnically diverse population .",3
"In intervention delivery , we increased staff time to overcome economic and cultural barriers to retention and adherence .",3
"To ensure treatment fidelity and replicability , we monitored intervention protocol delivery in accordance with a rigorous plan .",3
"Finally , we have overcome unanticipated assessment and design concerns related to ( 1 ) determining pressure ulcer incidence/severity , ( 2 ) randomization imbalance , and ( 3 ) inadvertent potential control group contamination .",3
"We have addressed the most daunting challenges encountered in the recruitment , assessment , and intervention phases of PUPS .",4
Some challenges and solutions may not apply to trials conducted in other settings .,4
"Overcoming challenges has required a multifaceted approach incorporating individualization , flexibility , and persistence , as well as the ability to implement needed mid-course corrections .",4
"Mycobacterium tuberculosis drug susceptibility results were available in 489 ( 76 % ) of 642 SAPiT patients : 23 had MDR-TB , 14 in the integrated treatment arm and 9 in the sequential treatment arm .",3
"At 18 months , the mortality rate was 11.9 / 100 person-years ( py ; 95 % CI 1.4-42 .8 ) in the combined integrated treatment arm and 56.0 / 100 py ( 95 % CI 18.2-130 .8 ) in the sequential treatment arm ( hazard ratio adjusted for baseline CD4 count and whether MDR-TB treatment was initiated : 0.14 ; 95 % CI 0.02-0 .94 , P = 0.04 ) .",3
"Despite the small sample size , the 86 % reduction in mortality due to early initiation of ART in MDR-TB patients was statistically significant .",4
"In 3 groups , IOP decreased significantly after injection of drugs and insertion of LMA in comparison to basic values , although IOP after LMA insertion was more than before LMA insertion .",3
"In case of propofol , the changes in IOP between 2min after induction and the baseline were higher than others , especially thiopental ( P = 0.031 ) .",3
"BP declined remarkably after induction ( P < 0.001 ) and rose significantly after LMA insertion in all groups , except in the propofol group .",3
"The HR was decreased significantly after induction , except in thiopental .",3
Propofol prevented IOP increase after induction compared with other drugs .,4
Decrease in BP and HR after induction and LMA insertion was remarkable .,4
"Thiopental seemed to be the best drug for controlling cardiovascular parameters , especially HR , and it also prevents IOP rise .",4
The need for additional propofol doses was significantly higher in Group AP than in Group KP .,3
"MAP at minute 1 and 5 , Ramsey Sedation Scale at minute 5 , and discharge time were significantly higher in Group KP than in Group AP .",3
Additional propofol doses and total propofol dose were significantly lower in Group KP than in Group AP .,3
"Ketofol provided better hemodynamic stability and quality of sedation compared with alfentanil-propofol combination in elective colonoscopy , and required fewer additional propofol ; however , it prolonged discharge time .",4
Both combinations can safely be used in colonoscopy sedation .,4
The ACT group ( n = 9 ) and control group ( n = 8 ) had similar baseline characteristics .,3
Seven participants ( 78 % ) completed 18 hours of ACT .,3
"Medium effect sizes were observed for improved cognition as indicated by auditory processing speed ( d = 0.78 ) , speech processing ( d = 0.88 ) , and working memory ( d = 0.44-0 .50 ) .",3
"Small effect sizes were found for improved functional outcomes including HF selfcare ( d = 0.34 ) , Timed Instrumental Activities of Daily Living ( d = 0.32 ) , Six-Minute Walk Test ( d = 0.38 ) and Short-Form-36 ( d = 0.22 ) relative to controls .",3
Results indicated ACT is feasible among persons with HF .,4
"Despite a small sample size , ACT showed potential for improved speed of processing and working memory and improved functional outcomes , and warrants further exploration .",4
Forty-five patients ( 90 % ) completed the study .,3
The Clinical Global Impression-Change response rate difference favoring naltrexone in completers was 19.8 % ( 95 % confidence interval [ CI ] -8.7 % to 44.2 % ) .,3
"While this difference was not significant ( odds ratio = 1.6 , 95 % CI 0.5-5 .2 , Wald 2 [ df ] = 0.5 [ 1 ] , p = 0.5 ) , naltrexone treatment led to a significantly greater decrease in QUIP-RS ICD score over time compared with placebo ( regression coefficient for interaction term in linear mixed-effects model = -7.37 , F [ df ] = 4.3 [ 1 , 49 ] , p = 0.04 ) .",3
The estimated changes in QUIP-RS ICD scores from baseline to week 8 were 14.9 points ( 95 % CI 9.9-19 .9 ) for naltrexone and 7.5 points ( 95 % CI 2.5-12 .6 ) for placebo .,3
"Naltrexone treatment was not efficacious for the treatment of ICDs in PD using a global assessment of response , but findings using a PD-specific ICD rating scale support further evaluation of opioid antagonists for the treatment of ICD symptoms in PD .",4
Pre-filled blister packaging may provide an inexpensive solution to improve medication adherence .,4
Our study enrolls a diverse sample and provides information about whether an adherence packaging intervention can : 1 ) improve medication adherence ; 2 ) improve patients ' LDL-C levels ; 3 ) be well received by patients and providers ; and 4 ) provide a cost effective solution to improve medication adherence .,4
"Patients assigned to either carboplatin or bevacizumab were less likely to complete wP and ddAC without skipped doses , dose modification , or early discontinuation resulting from toxicity .",3
"Grade 3 neutropenia and thrombocytopenia were more common with carboplatin , as were hypertension , infection , thromboembolic events , bleeding , and postoperative complications with bevacizumab .",3
"Employing one-sided P values , addition of either carboplatin ( 60 % v 44 % ; P = .0018 ) or bevacizumab ( 59 % v 48 % ; P = .0089 ) significantly increased pCR breast , whereas only carboplatin ( 54 % v 41 % ; P = .0029 ) significantly raised pCR breast/axilla .",3
More-than-additive interactions between the two agents could not be demonstrated .,3
"In stage II to III TNBC , addition of either carboplatin or bevacizumab to NACT increased pCR rates , but whether this will improve relapse-free or overall survival is unknown .",4
"Given results from recently reported adjuvant trials , further investigation of bevacizumab in this setting is unlikely , but the role of carboplatin could be evaluated in definitive studies , ideally limited to biologically defined patient subsets most likely to benefit from this agent .",4
"Short-term supplementation of E+R increased resting EE ( E+R vs PLA : 5.450.24 vs 5.230.25 kJmin ( -1 ) , P = 0.039 ) , whereas both E+R ( 69918kJ120min ( -1 ) vs 67620kJ120min ( -1 ) , P = 0.028 ) and E+R+S ( 70418kJ120min ( -1 ) vs 67620kJ120min ( -1 ) , P = 0.014 ) increased 2-4h-postprandial EE compared with PLA .",3
"Metabolic flexibility , calculated as the postprandial increase to the highest respiratory quotient achieved , tended to be improved by E+R compared with PLA and E+R+S only in men ( E+R vs PLA : 0.110.02 vs 0.060.02 , P = 0.059 ; E+R+S : 0.030.02 , P = 0.009 ) .",3
E+R+S significantly increased fasting plasma free fatty acid ( P = 0.064 ) and glycerol ( P = 0.021 ) concentrations compared with PLA .,3
"We demonstrated for the first time that combined E+R supplementation for 3 days significantly increased fasting and postprandial EE , which was accompanied by improved metabolic flexibility in men but not in women .",4
Addition of soy isoflavones partially reversed these effects possibly due to their higher lipolytic potential .,4
The present findings may imply that long-term supplementation of these dosages of epigallocatechin-gallate combined with resveratrol may improve metabolic health and body weight regulation .,4
"There was no difference between the groups with regards to demographics , prognostic severity scores , symptoms , and biliary findings .",3
"No patients developed organ failure , pancreatic necrosis , or died in either group .",3
Time to the resolution of pain and resumption of solid food intake were similar .,3
"Three ( 3.6 % ) patients required readmission within 30 days , 1 from home and 2 from the hospital groups .",3
"The total cost was significantly less in home group ( $ 13973 vs. $ 951715 , p < 0.001 ) .",3
Mild NAAP can be safely treated at home with regular visits by a nurse under the supervision of a physician .,4
Widespread adoption of this practice may result in large cost savings .,4
The study enrolled 214 patients .,3
"Of these , 115 ( 53.7 % ) were clopidogrel responders ( group 0 ) , and 99 ( 46.3 % ) had high OTR ( clopidogrel nonresponders ) ; of which , 50 were randomly assigned to group 1 and 49 to group 2 .",3
"At baseline , the PRU value did not differ between group 1 ( 288.50 46 ) and group 2 ( 295.45 47.2 ; P = .308 ) .",3
Patients displayed reduced mean platelet reactivity levels at 30 days in group 1 ( 238.96 72.25 ; P < .001 ) and group 2 ( 201.85 77.8 ; P < .001 ) .,3
"Although high-dose clopidogrel resulted in more intense platelet function inhibition , the differences between median 30-day PRU values ( P = .483 ) and the percentage change of PRU ( P = .442 ) for groups 1 and 2 were not significant .",3
"The incidences of transient ischemic attack , stroke , or death at up to 30 days after CAS in the high-OTR patients were similar between groups 1 and 2 ( P = .481 ) .",3
Patients with high OTR undergoing CAS treated with standard-dose and double-dose clopidogrel had significantly reduced platelet reactivity after 30 days .,4
The double dose did not result in statistically significantly greater reductions in reactivity compared with the standard dose .,4
"CT ( n = 25 ) and HT ( n = 25 ) both showed a significant improvement in peak oxygen uptake ( peak VO2 ) ( 10 % and 14 % respectively ) and quality of life after 12 weeks of training , without significant between-group differences .",3
The average training intensity of the HT group was 73.33.5 % of HRmax .,3
Training adherence was similar between groups .,3
This analysis shows that HT with telemonitoring guidance has similar short-term effects on exercise capacity and quality of life as CT in CR patients .,4
"While body mass decreased in both groups ( -1.4 kg ; p = 0.01 ) following the confinement , whole body fat mass was only reduced in the Exercise group ( -1.5 kg ; p = 0.01 ) .",3
"At Post , postprandial serum insulin was reduced in the Sedentary group ( -49 % ; p = 0.01 ) and postprandial plasma glucose in the Exercise group ( -19 % ; p = 0.03 ) .",3
"Fasting serum total cholesterol levels were reduced ( -12 % ; p = 0.01 ) at Post in the Exercise group only , secondary to low-density lipoprotein cholesterol reduction ( -16 % ; p = 0.01 ) .",3
"No differences between groups or testing periods were noted in fasting and/or postprandial concentrations of total ghrelin , peptide YY , and glucagon-like peptide-1 , leptin , adiponectin , expired 13CO2 as well as perceived appetite ratings ( p > 0.05 ) .",3
These findings suggest that performing daily moderate intensity exercise training during continuous hypoxic exposure does not alter hormonal appetite regulation but can improve the lipid profile in healthy young males .,4
"Out of 99 subjects who were randomized into app and control groups , 85 participants ( 86 % ) completed the study , 56 in the intervention and 29 in the control group .",3
"The mean age was 47.9 ( SD 12.3 ) years , and mean Body Mass Index was 26.2 ( SD 3.9 ) .",3
"Among the intervention group only , frequency of app use was 2.7 ( SD 1.9 ) days/week .",3
The mean change in physical activity was 63 ( SD 20.8 ) minutes in the app group and -30 ( SD 27.5 ) minutes in the control group ( P = .02 ) .,3
The mean weight change was -1.44 ( SD 0.4 ) kg in the app group and -0.128 ( SD 0.36 ) kg in the control group ( P = .03 ) .,3

"Time from induction to active labor ( 13 with PGE2 vs 19.5 h with double-balloon catheter ; P = 0.243 ) was comparable , with no differences in cesarean rates ( 15.4 vs 7.7 % ; P = 0.668 ) or neonatal outcomes .",3
"The PGE2 group had higher incidence of early device removal ( 76.9 vs 26.9 % ; P = 0.0001 ) , mostly because of active labor or non-reassuring fetal heart rate .",3
Fewer PGE2 patients required oxytocin augmentation for labor induction ( 53.8 vs 84.6 % P = 0.034 ) .,3
Time to delivery was significantly shorter with PGE2 ( 16 vs 20.5 h ; P = 0.045 ) .,3

"FMD , serum levels of isoprostanes , nitrite/nitrate ( NOx ) and sNOX2-dp , a marker of blood NOX2 activity , maximal walking distance ( MWD ) and maximal walking time ( MWT ) were studied in 20 PAD patients ( 14 males and 6 females , mean age : 699 years ) randomly allocated to 40 g of dark chocolate ( > 85 % cocoa ) or 40 g of milk chocolate ( 35 % cocoa ) in a single blind , cross-over design .",3
The above variables were assessed at baseline and 2 hours after chocolate ingestion .,3
"Dark chocolate intake significantly increased MWD ( +11 % ; P < 0.001 ) , MWT ( +15 % ; P < 0.001 ) , serum NOx ( +57 % ; P < 0.001 ) and decreased serum isoprostanes ( -23 % ; P = 0.01 ) and sNOX2-dp ( -37 % ; P < 0.001 ) ; no changes of the above variables were observed after milk chocolate intake .",3
Serum epicatechin and its methylated metabolite significantly increased only after dark chocolate ingestion .,3
Multiple linear regression analysis showed that of MWD was independently associated with of MWT ( P < 0.001 ) and of NOx ( P = 0.018 ) .,3
In vitro study demonstrated that HUVEC incubated with a mixture of polyphenols significantly increased nitric oxide ( P < 0.001 ) and decreased E-selectin ( P < 0.001 ) and VCAM1 ( P < 0.001 ) .,3
In PAD patients dark but not milk chocolate acutely improves walking autonomy with a mechanism possibly related to an oxidative stress-mediated mechanism involving NOX2 regulation .,4
The mean follow-up time was 46.5 weeks in the levofloxacin group and 46.3 weeks in the placebo group ( 27 patients had follow-up terminated before the end of the planned follow-up period or development of viruria because the trial was stopped early owing to lack of funding ) .,3
"BK viruria occurred in 22 patients ( 29 % ) in the levofloxacin group and in 26 patients ( 33.3 % ) in the placebo group ( hazard ratio , 0.91 ; 95 % CI , 0.51-1 .63 ; P = .58 ) .",3
There was no significant difference between the 2 groups in regard to any of the secondary end points .,3
"There was an increased risk of resistant infection among isolates usually sensitive to quinolones in the levofloxacin group vs placebo ( 14/24 [ 58.3 % ] vs 15/45 [ 33.3 % ] , respectively ; risk ratio , 1.75 ; 95 % CI , 1.01-2 .98 ) as well as a nonsignificant increased risk of suspected tendinitis ( 6/76 [ 7.9 % ] vs 1/78 [ 1.3 % ] ; risk ratio , 6.16 ; 95 % CI , 0.76-49 .95 ) .",3
"Among kidney transplant recipients , a 3-month course of levofloxacin initiated early following transplantation did not prevent BK viruria .",4
Levofloxacin was associated with an increased risk of adverse events such as bacterial resistance .,4
These findings do not support the use of levofloxacin to prevent posttransplant BK virus infection .,4
The need for repeated SPECT in the adenosine studies was 5.3 % in the carbonated water group versus 19.4 % in the still water group ( p = 0.019 ) .,3

"In total , 303 survivors completed the follow-up survey ( six months after completion of the baseline survey ) and participants in the Web-based intervention condition had significantly greater reductions in insomnia and greater increases in minutes per week of vigorous exercise and stretching compared to controls .",3
There were no significant changes in fruit and vegetable consumption or other outcomes .,3
"The Web-based intervention impacted insomnia and exercise ; however , a majority of the sample met or exceeded national recommendations for health behaviors and were not suffering from depression or fatigue at baseline .",4
"Thus , the survivors were very healthy and well-adjusted upon entry and their ability to make substantial health behavior changes may have been limited .",4
"Future work is discussed , with emphasis placed on ways in which Web-based interventions can be more specifically analyzed for benefit , such as in regard to social networking .",4

Peak oxygen consumption ( VO2peak ) increased in both groups ( P < 0.001 ) .,3
"Compared with AET ( n = 11 ) , HIT ( n = 13 ) increased 24-h LF power ( P = 0.024 ) , tended to increase 24-h HF power ( P = 0.068 ) , and increased daytime HF power ( P = 0.038 ) .",3
"In home-based measurements , supine HF power decreased on the days after HIT ( P = 0.006 , n = 12 ) but not AET ( P = 0.80 , n = 9 ) session .",3
The acute response of HF power to HIT session did not change during the intervention .,3
"In conclusion , HIT was more effective short-term strategy to increase R-R interval variability than aerobic training , most probably by inducing larger increases in cardiac vagal activity .",4
The acute autonomic responses to the single HIT session were not modified by short-term training .,4
Aberrant P53 expression was found in 65 % ( 482/740 ) of patients .,3
It was associated with distal location ( p < 0.001 ) and stage III disease ( p < 0.001 ) .,3
"No effect was observed on disease-free or overall survival , and there was no interaction with chemotherapy or radiotherapy .",3
Analysis of P53 expression in the patients recruited to the VICTOR trial confirmed that P53 expression is associated with site and stage of CRC .,4
"However , independently , this biomarker has neither prognostic nor predictive utility in this cohort of patients .",4
"There was no significant difference in postoperative pain between the 2 groups , but more patients requested rescue analgesia in the CWI group than in the IV PCA group in 24 hours ( 18 versus 9 patients , respectively ; P = 0.010 ) .",3
"The PONV scores at 12 and 24 hours were , respectively , 0.28 and 0.27 in the CWI group , and 0.71 and 0.73 in the IV PCA group ( P = 0.004 ) .",3

"At 22 months , the OB prevalence and BMI values were similar in intervention and control groups .",3
"Relative to children in control schools , the percentage of boys in the intervention group who performed 4 after-school PA h/week was 15 % higher ( p = 0.027 ) , whereas the percentage of girls in both groups remained similar .",3
"Also , 16.6 % more boys in the intervention group watched 2 television ( TV ) h/day ( p = 0.009 ) , compared to controls ; and no changes were observed in girls in both groups .",3
Our school-based intervention is feasible and reproducible by increasing after-school PA ( to 4 h/week ) in boys .,4
"Despite this improvement , there was no change in BMI and prevalence of OB .",4
"No effects of trial condition were observed on any of the driving performance measures or on subjective ratings of mood , alcohol intoxication , and driving impairment .",3
SDLP was higher following the consumption of alcohol compared to the placebo trial .,3
"However , no differences in SDLP were recorded between the alcohol trials , indicating that hydration level had no observable interaction with alcohol to influence SDLP performance .",3
"Overall , it appears that dehydration does not exacerbate impairment in driving performance caused by mild-moderate alcohol intoxication .",4
Further research is required to clarify the effects of alcohol and dehydration at various alcohol doses .,4

A weekly regimen of carboplatin and paclitaxel might be a reasonable option for first-line treatment of women with advanced ovarian cancer .,4
"Fifty-three patients completed the study ( WSE , n = 24 ; placebo , n = 29 ) , and the 2 groups were matched in terms of demographic , illness , and treatment characteristics .",3
"Compared to placebo , WSE provided significant benefits for 3 cognitive tasks : digit span backward ( P = .035 ) , Flanker neutral response time ( P = .033 ) , and the social cognition response rating of the Penn Emotional Acuity Test ( P = .045 ) .",3
"The size of the WSE treatment effect for digit span backward was in the medium range ( Cohen d = 0.51 ; 95 % CI , 0.25-0 .77 ) .",3
None of the other cognitive tasks showed significant between-group differences .,3
"Mood and anxiety scale scores remained stable , and adverse events were minor .",3
"Although results are preliminary , WSE appears to improve auditory-verbal working memory ( digit span backward ) , a measure of reaction time , and a measure of social cognition in bipolar disorder .",4
"Given the paucity of data for improving cognitive capacity in bipolar disorder , WSE offers promise , appears to have a benign side-effects profile , and merits further study .",4

U-PCR was positive for all subjects in the PSI group with one discrepancy between real-time PCR and microbiological culture results in differentiation between gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria .,3
"In the non-PSI group , MRS-PCR and U-PCR were positive in three and seven cases , respectively .",3
"The sensitivity , specificity , positive predictive value , and negative predictive value of MRS-PCR for diagnosing MRS infection were 1.00 , 0.91 , 0.57 , and 1.00 , respectively ; those for the diagnosis of bacterial infection with U-PCR were 1.00 , 0.73 , 0.63 , and 1.00 , respectively .",3
Identification of MRS infection and ability to differentiate between gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria is rapidly achieved using MRS-PCR and U-PCR .,4
Real-time PCR provides a sensitive molecular diagnosis of PSI and may contribute to antibiotic selection .,4
"CT attenuation and noise of the ICA and MCA in Group A were higher than those of Group B ( all P < 0.001 ) while the SNRICA , SNRMCA , CNRICA , and CNRMCA of Group A at S4-5 were comparable to ( P > 0.05 ) or higher than in Group B ( P < 0.05 ) .",3

"Desmopressin treatment was initiated in 421 patients , and 259 patients were eligible for randomization .",3
"Relapse rates were 39 ( 1 % ) and 42 ( 4 % ) for the structured withdrawal groups , which were significantly less than for direct withdrawal ( 55 , 3 % ) and placebo ( 53 , 1 % ) .",3
"Logistic regression analysis revealed that initial effective dose of 240 cg , greater number of wet nights before treatment and nonstructured withdrawal were associated with higher relapse rates .",3
We found that structured withdrawal with the fast melting oralformulation of desmopressin results in decreased relapse rates .,4
"Application of astructured withdrawal program was also an independent factor associated withreduced relapse rates , together with lower initial effective dose and number of wet nights per week .",4
"Relapse after cessation of desmopressin is an important problem , and in this study structured withdrawal was observed to be associated with decreased relapse rates compared to placebo and direct withdrawal .",4
"Of the 116 patients , 6 received a replacement before leaving the operating room ; all other patients had mild or less mitral regurgitation on intraoperative echocardiogram after repair .",3
"During the 2-year follow-up period , 76 patients developed moderate/severe mitral regurgitation or died ( 53 mitral regurgitation recurrences , 13 mitral regurgitation recurrences and death , and 10 deaths ) .",3
The mechanism for recurrent mitral regurgitation was largely mitral valve leaflet tethering .,3
"Our model ( including age , body mass index , sex , race , effective regurgitant orifice area , basal aneurysm/dyskinesis , New York Heart Association class , history of coronary artery bypass grafting , percutaneous coronary intervention , or ventricular arrhythmias ) yielded an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.82 .",3
The model demonstrated good discrimination in identifying patients who will survive 2 years without recurrent mitral regurgitation after mitral valve repair .,4
"Although our results require validation , they offer a clinically relevant risk score for selection of surgical candidates for this procedure .",4
Generalized linear models indicated Seeking Safety ( SS ; a cognitive-behavioral intervention ) was significantly more effective than Women 's Health Education ( WHE ; a control group intervention ) in reducing stimulant use at follow-up among women who were heavy stimulant users at pre-treatment and who showed improvements in PTSD symptoms .,3
There were no significant differences between the interventions among women who were light stimulant users at treatment entry .,3
These findings suggest that integrated treatment of co-occurring PTSD and addictions may be more effective than general health education approaches for heavy stimulant users .,4
Assessment of frequency of stimulant use among individuals with PTSD symptoms may inform treatment selection for this population .,4
"We recruited 307 patients ( ethanol , n = 153 ; heparin , n = 154 ) .",3
"In the ethanol group , 16/153 ( 10 % ) patients developed a CABSI versus 29/154 ( 19 % ) in the heparin group .",3

"This is the first randomised controlled trial to show that ethanol locks can prevent CABSI in paediatric oncology patients , in particular CABSI caused by Gram-positive bacteria .",4
Implementation of ethanol locks in clinical practice should be considered .,4
"Analysis of 5-minute segments of the ECG during quiet rest showed reduced high-frequency heart rate variability with UFP relative to air exposure ( p = 0.014 ) , paralleled by non-significant reductions in time-domain heart rate variability parameters .",3
"In the analysis of longer durations of the ECG , we found that UFP exposure increased the heart rate relative to air exposure .",3
"During the 21 - to 45-hour interval after exposure , the average heart rate increased approximately 8 beats per minute with UFP , compared to 5 beats per minute with air ( p = 0.045 ) .",3
There were no UFP effects on cardiac rhythm or repolarization .,3
Inhalation of elemental carbon ultrafine particles alters heart rate and heart rate variability in people with type 2 diabetes .,4

Each group showed a significant reduction in depressive symptoms .,3
There were no significant differences between the MNNS condition and the control condition with regard to the reduction of depressive symptoms over time .,3
There was a marked reduction in the depressive symptoms of the patients of both groups which had received short-term treatments involving the viewing of pictures with a positive valence .,4
This reduction was still apparent three months after the treatment .,4
The positive pictures presented in the MNNS method were found to be just as effective in reducing depressive symptoms as the positive pictures presented by the IAPS .,4
Multilevel analysis showed that the intervention resulted in an improvement of individual professionals .,3
"At the 3 month follow-up , professionals who received the intervention showed greater guideline adherence , improved self-perceived knowledge and improved confidence as providers of care than professionals who were only exposed to traditional guideline dissemination .",3
Subgroup analyses showed that improved guideline adherence was found among nurses but not among psychiatrists and psychologists .,3
No significant effect of the intervention on team performance was found .,3
The ICT environment in departments was often technically inadequate when displaying the video clips clip of the survey .,4
"This may have caused considerable drop-out and possibly introduced selection bias , as professionals who were strongly affiliated to the theme of the study might have been more likely to finish the study .",4
Our results support the idea that an e-learning supported Train-the-Trainer programme is an effective strategy for implementing clinical guidelines and improving care for suicidal patients .,4
RESPOND builds on prior falls prevention learnings and aims to help individuals make guided decisions about how they will manage their falls risk .,4
"Patient-centred models have been successfully trialled in chronic and cardiovascular disease ; however , evidence to support this approach in falls prevention is limited .",4
This largest to date double-blind placebo-controlled multicenter trial investigates the effect of adjunct glucocorticoids in 800 patients with CAP requiring hospitalization .,4
It aims to give conclusive answers about benefits and risks of corticosteroid treatment in CAP .,4
The inclusion of less severe CAP patients will be expected to lead to a relatively low mortality rate and survival benefit might not be shown .,4
"However , our study has adequate power for the clinically relevant endpoint of clinical stability .",4
"Due to discontinuing glucocorticoids without tapering after seven days , we limit duration of glucocorticoid exposition , which may reduce possible side effects .",4
"The average maximum concentration ( Cmax ) and area under the concentration-time curve from time 0 to infinity ( AUC ) values of KM-023 for the 75-600 mg doses in the single-dose study ranged from 440.2 ng/mL to 1,245.4 ng/mL and 11,142.4 ng h/mL to 33,705.6 ng h/mL , respectively .",3
"Values of the mean Cmax at a steady state and AUC within the dosing interval ranged from 385.1 ng/mL to 1,096.7 ng/mL and 3,698.9 ng h/mL to 10,232.6 ng h/mL , respectively , following 75-600 mg doses in the multiple-dose study .",3
Dose proportionality was not observed for KM-023 .,3
KM-023 showed a 0.6-fold accumulation after multiple doses in the 600 mg dose group .,3
The mean half-life values ranged between 20.7 and 31.2 hours .,3
KM-023 was generally well tolerated without serious adverse events .,3
KM-023 demonstrated dose - and time-dependent nonlinear pharmacokinetic characteristics after single or multiple doses over a dose range ( 75-600 mg ) in healthy subjects .,4
KM-023 showed favorable tolerability in this study .,4
This Phase I clinical trial information can be used to design further clinical studies appropriately to evaluate KM-023 in patients with HIV-1 infection .,4
"Compared with the control group , CRBSIs rates per 1000 catheter-days was significantly lower ( 0.58 vs 4.4 events ; p = 0.002 ) and cumulative infection-free catheter survival was significantly higher ( log rank statistic 5.88 ; p = 0.015 ) in the antibiotic group .",3
There were no statistical differences regarding incidences of catheter removal ( 8.7 % in the antibiotic group vs 22 % in the control group ; p = 0.116 ) or thrombosis ( 2.2 % in the antibiotic group vs 9.8 % in the control group ; p = 0.129 ) between the two groups .,3
cotrimoxazole containing catheter lock solution is effective in reducing CRBSIs incidence and prolonging dialysis catheter survival in HD patients .,4
The primary outcome is weight loss .,3
"Secondary outcomes include measures for body composition , fitness , eating behavior , exercise motivation and , quality of life as well as cognition and food reward and motivation as assessed by functional magnetic resonance imaging ( fMRI ) tasks .",3
"If successful , the REWARD program could be extended to help sustain weight loss in obese cancer and non-cancer patients .",4
One hundred and thirty-one dyads were recruited to this study .,3
"There was no significant difference in Behavioural and Psychological Symptoms as measured by the Neuropsychiatric Inventory at week 12 between the group receiving the dyadic exercise regimen and those that did not ( adjusted difference in means ( intervention minus control ) = -1.53 , p = 0.6 , 95 % CI [ -7.37 , 4.32 ] ) .",3
"There was a significant between-group difference in caregiver 's burden as measured by the Zarit Caregiver Burden Inventory at week 12 ( OR = 0.18 , p = 0.01 , CI [ 0.05 , 0.69 ] ) favouring the exercise group .",3
"This study found that regular simple exercise does not appear to improve the behavioural and psychological symptoms of dementia , but did seem to attenuate caregiver burden .",4
Further study to improve exercise uptake are needed .,4
"Epicatechin changed epicatechin - placebo for soluble endothelial selectin ( sE-selectin ) by -7.7 ng/mL ( 95 % CI : -14.5 , -0.83 ; P = 0.03 ) but did not significantly change this difference ( -0.30 ; 95 % CI : -0.61 , 0.01 ; P = 0.06 ) for the z score for endothelial dysfunction .",3
"Quercetin changed quercetin - placebo for sE-selectin by -7.4 ng/mL ( 95 % CI : -14.3 , -0.56 ; P = 0.03 ) , that for IL-1 by -0.23 pg/mL ( 95 % CI : -0.40 , -0.06 ; P = 0.009 ) , and that for the z score for inflammation by -0.33 ( 95 % CI : -0.60 , -0.05 ; P = 0.02 ) .",3
"In ( pre ) hypertensive men and women , epicatechin may contribute to the cardioprotective effects of cocoa and tea through improvements in endothelial function .",4
Quercetin may contribute to the cardioprotective effects of tea possibly by improving endothelial function and reducing inflammation .,4
This trial was registered at clinicaltrials.gov as NCT01691404 .,4
"Compare to Sham stimulation , both TENS and NMES are able to reduce MSNA ( 63.5 3.5 vs 69.7 3.1 bursts / min , p < 0.01 after TENS and 51.6 3.3 vs 56.7 3.3 bursts / min , p < 0 , 01 after NMES ) .",3
"No variation of blood pressure , heart rate or respiratory parameters was observed after stimulation .",3
"The results suggest that sensory stimulation of lower limbs by electrical device , either TENS or NMES , could inhibit sympathetic outflow directed to legs in CHF patients .",4
These properties could benefits CHF patients and pave the way for a new non-pharmacological approach of CHF .,4
"Groups significantly differed across all comparisons with regard to incidence of any quit attempt ( MNQ : 77 % , UNQ : 40 % , UQ : 18 % , p < .05 ) and any 24-hr quit attempts ( 62 % , 32 % , 16 % , p < .05 ) .",3
"Clinically meaningful differences emerged in the rates of floating ( 19 % , 17 % , 6 % ) and point prevalence abstinence ( 17 % , 15 % , 5 % ) .",3
"Compared to participants in Group UQ ( 11 % ) , a greater proportion of participants in Group MNQ ( 48 % , p = .01 ) and Group UNQ ( 31 % , p = .01 ) reduced their daily cigarette consumption by at least half .",3
"Proxy measures of cessation readiness ( e.g. , motivation ) favored participants receiving active forms of treatment .",3
Providing NRT samples engaged both motivated and unmotivated smokers into the quitting process and produced positive changes in smoking outcomes .,4
This suggests that motivation should not be considered a necessary precondition to receiving treatment .,4
"Eighty patients ( 60 vivax , 15 falciparum , and 5 mixed ) were randomized to dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine .",3
Intention-to-treat all-species efficacy at Day 42 was 85 % for the two-day regimen ( 95 % CI 69-94 ) and 90 % for the three-day regimen ( 95 % CI 75-97 ) .,3
PCR-adjusted falciparum efficacy was 75 % in both groups with nearly half ( 45 % ) still parasitemic at Day 3 .,3
"Plasma piperaquine levels were comparable to prior published reports , but on the day of recrudescence were below measurable in vitro piperaquine IC50 levels in all falciparum treatment failures .",3
"In the brief period since introduction of dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine , there is early evidence suggesting declining efficacy relative to previous reports .",4
Parasite IC50 levels in excess of plasma piperaquine levels seen only in treatment failures raises concern for clinically significant piperaquine resistance in Cambodia .,4
"These findings warrant improved monitoring of clinical outcomes and follow-up , given few available alternative drugs .",4
"During follow-up , 1089 lung cancers were reported in the LDCT arm and 969 in the CXR arm of the NLST .",3
"The probability is 18.5 % ( 95 % CI , 5.4 % -30.6 % ) that any lung cancer detected by screening with LDCT was an overdiagnosis , 22.5 % ( 95 % CI , 9.7 % -34.3 % ) that a non-small cell lung cancer detected by LDCT was an overdiagnosis , and 78.9 % ( 95 % CI , 62.2 % -93.5 % ) that a bronchioalveolar lung cancer detected by LDCT was an overdiagnosis .",3
The number of cases of overdiagnosis found among the 320 participants who would need to be screened in the NLST to prevent 1 death from lung cancer was 1.38 .,3
"More than 18 % of all lung cancers detected by LDCT in the NLST seem to be indolent , and overdiagnosis should be considered when describing the risks of LDCT screening for lung cancer .",4
There was one drop-out in the control group .,3
No adverse events were reported in the groups .,3
"Subjects in the intervention group had a greater weight change from baseline to the end of the 3-month intervention period ( -3.7 + / - 2.5 [ SD ] kg in the intervention group vs. -0.1 + / - 1.4 kg in the control group , P = 0.002 ) .",3
Most subjects recorded that the use of a healthy plate could be recommended to other people .,3
"The lifestyle intervention program using the Japanese-style healthy plate , which was developed for portion control , may effectively reduce body weight in overweight and obese diabetic subjects in Japan .",4
Further studies are needed to establish the efficacy of this methodology on weight management .,4
"Were allocated 40 patients , 10 in each group .",3
"There were significant differences for the expiratory reserve volume and percentage of the predicted expiratory reserve volume , in which the groups that received treatment showed a smaller loss in expiratory reserve volume from the preoperative to postoperative stages .",3
"The postoperative radiographic analysis showed a 25 % prevalence of atelectasis for Gcontrol , 11.1 % for Gintra , 10 % for Gpre , and 0 % for Gpos .",3
There was no significant difference in diaphragmatic mobility amongst the groups .,3
"The optimal time of application of positive pressure is in the immediate postoperative period , immediately after extubation , because it reduces the incidence of atelectasis and there is reduction of loss of expiratory reserve volume .",4
Children ( n = 133 ) were analyzed quantitatively for TBSs by using RID .,3
"TBSs , retinyl esters , some carotenoids , and PLP differed by village site .",3
Serum carotenoids were elevated above most nonintervened reference values for children .,3
"- Carotene , - carotene , and lutein values were > 95th percentile from children in the US NHANES III , and 13 % of children had hypercarotenemia ( defined as total carotenoid concentration > 3.7 mol/L ) .",3
"Although only 2 % of children had serum retinyl esters > 10 % of total retinol plus retinyl esters , 16 % of children had > 5 % as esters , which was consistent with high liver retinol stores .",3
"Ratios of serum retinol to retinol-binding protein did not deviate from 1.0 , which indicated full saturation .",3
"ALT activity was low , which was likely due to underlying vitamin B-6 deficiency , which was confirmed by very low serum PLP concentrations .",3
The finding of hypervitaminosis A in Zambian children was supported by high circulating concentrations of carotenoids and mildly elevated serum retinyl esters .,4
ALT-activity assays may be compromised with co-existing vitamin B-6 deficiency .,4
Nutrition education to improve intakes of whole grains and animal-source foods may enhance vitamin B-6 status in Zambians .,4
"Of all patients , 41 ( 59 % ) had a urinary catheter preoperatively .",3
"Urine cultures were positive in 31 patients , of whom 29 ( 94 % ) had a urinary catheter .",3
"Surgical site infection occurred in 10 patients ( 18 % ) , and 100 % of the causative microorganisms were gram-negative bacteria characteristic of the urinary flora .",3
The type of antiseptic did not affect the risk of SSI ( p = 1.00 ) .,3
"The most important risk factor for infection was the presence of a urinary catheter preoperatively ( p = 0.003 ) ; also significant were the formation of a vesicocutaneous fistula ( p = 0.008 ) , increasing age ( p = 0.02 ) , and the presence of a positive preoperative urine culture ( p = 0.03 ) .",3
"In a cohort of patients submitted to open prostatectomy , SSI was not related to the type of antiseptic .",4
The main risk factor was the presence of a urinary catheter preoperatively .,4
All microorganisms isolated from the SSIs were characteristic of urinary tract infections .,4
"The overall conception rate was 52.4 % and 54.8 % for the GPG+P 4 and P4 + PGF groups , respectively .",3
"The odds of conception for the two treatments were not different ( OR = 0.90 ; 95 % CI = 0.67-1 .23 ) , nor was there any difference between groups in different years ( p = 0.58 ) .",3
"Farm affected conception rate ( p = 0.002 ) , but there was no interaction with treatment ( p = 0.92 ) .",3
"This study has shown that an alternative synchronisation programme can produce similar results in terms of conception rate to the GPG+P 4 treatment , currently commonly used in heifers .",4
"More research is required to establish whether other modifications to the GPG+P 4 programme can produce similar results at lower costs , and to identify and quantify farm factors which affect the economic benefit of heifer synchronisation .",4
"This study indicated that synchronising heifers with P4 and PGF resulted in conception rates equivalent to those resulting from a GPG+P 4 treatment , but with reduced drug costs .",4
"However , because heifers in the GPG+P 4 group received the second GnRH injection at the time of AI , they needed only three yardings as opposed to the four required for the heifers treated with P4 and PGF .",4
"Thus , the choice of programme for an individual farm will depend on that farm 's circumstances , in particular the cost of yarding the heifers .",4
In this trial 569 patients were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to receive gemcitabine plus either erlotinib or a matched placebo .,3
"Overall , the method indicated no statistically significant overall treatment effect in favour of erlotinib ; if anything , the point estimate of the net proportion leaned in favour of the placebo group ( overall proportion in favour of erlotinib = -3.6 % , 95 % CI , -14.2 - 7.1 % ; P = 0.51 ) .",3
The net proportion was never in favour of the erlotinib group throughout all sensitivity analyses .,3
Generalised pairwise comparisons make it possible to assess the benefit-risk balance of new treatments using a single statistical test for any number of prioritised outcomes .,4
The benefit-risk assessment was not in favour of adding erlotinib to gemcitabine for the treatment of patients with advanced pancreatic cancer .,4
Total consumption of PCS propofol and alfentanil was significantly less in the dexmedetomidine than placebo group with a mean difference of -13.8 mg propofol ( 95 % confidence interval -27.3 to -0.3 ) and -34.5 g alfentanil ( 95 % confidence interval -68.2 to -0.7 ) at the completion of the procedure ( P = 0.044 ) .,3
"Weighted areas under the curve ( AUCw ) of OAA/S scores were significantly lower in the dexmedetomidine group before , during and after procedures ( P < 0.001 , P = 0.024 and P = 0.041 respectively ) .",3
AUCw of heart rate and systolic blood pressure were also significantly lower during the procedure ( P = 0.007 and P = 0.022 respectively ) with dexmedetomidine .,3
"There was no difference in recovery , side effects or satisfaction .",3
Intranasal dexmedetomidine with PCS propofol and alfentanil confers deeper perioperative clinical sedation with significantly less use of additional sedatives during upper gastrointestinal endoscopy .,4
"After 24months , a significant crestal bone loss was observed for EMD ( 1.01 mm ; p = 0.049 ) but not for OFD ( 0.14 mm ; p = 0.622 ) .",3
"However , no differences were detected between groups ( p = 0.37 ) .",3
"Reduction of the bone defect depth was significant for OFD ( 0.70 mm ; p = 0.005 ) but not for EMD ( 0.04 mm ; p = 0.86 ) , while no differences were detected between them ( p = 0.87 ) .",3
Both EMD ( 0.69 ; p = 0.82 ) and OFD ( 5.71 ; p = 0.24 ) showed an improvement in defect angle measurements but no significant differences were observed after 24months or between the groups ( p = 0.35 ) .,3
Linear radiographic analysis was not able to demonstrate superiority of EMD treated infrabony defects when compared to ODF after 24months .,4
"Optimized timing of CT scans on the basis of hazard of recurrence resulted in follow-up schedule options where CT is performed more sparsely than in the NCCN guidelines during adjuvant imatinib administration and more frequently , at approximately 3-month intervals , during the first 2 years that follow imatinib discontinuation when the risk of recurrence was the greatest .",3
The number of CT scans could be reduced by a median of 31 % ( from 13 to nine ) compared with the standard schedules within the first 6 years of follow-up without increasing the delay in recurrence detection .,3
Detection of GIST recurrence may be enhanced by adjusting the timing of the CT scans with the hazard of recurrence .,4
The method may be applicable to other human tumor types .,4
Online supplemental material is available for this article .,4
ITW 's validity was supported by piloting results and their successful cross-validation in the intervention study .,3
"In this , intervention students wrote longer and better texts than control students .",3
"Moreover , latent growth curve modelling showed that the more the intervention students conceived writing as a malleable skill , the more the quality of their texts improved .",3
This research is of educational relevance because it provides a measure to evaluate students ' implicit theories of writing and shows their impact on response to intervention .,4
"bAPAP has a faster time of antinociception onset ( 15 minutes , P < 0.01 ) and greater antinociception at 50 minutes ( P < 0.01 , CT1 ) and 30 minutes ( P < 0.01 , CT2 ) than ivAPAP and sAPAP .",3
All routes are similar after 50 minutes .,3
bAPAP has a faster antinociceptive action in healthy volunteers .,4
This attractive alternative to other routes would be useful in situations where oral or iv routes are not available .,4
This finding must now be confirmed in patients suffering from acute pain of mild and moderate intensity .,4
"At 6 months postoperatively , all 54 eyes had LogMAR BCVA 0.2 .",3
Patients who underwent PCRIs and Toric-IOL with LogMAR BCVA 0.1 showed no significant differences in group A ( P = 1.00 ) or in group B ( P = 0.59 ) .,3
"Group A showed no significant differences in LogMAR UCVA ( P = 0.70 ) , | EV | ( P = 0.13 ) , | SIRC | ( P = 0.71 ) , and CR ( P = 0.56 ) in patients underwent PCRIs and Toric-IOL .",3
"However , group B showed significant differences in LogMAR UCVA ( P < 0.01 ) , | EV | ( P < 0.01 ) ) , | SIRC | ( P < 0.01 ) , and CR ( P < 0.01 ) .",3
"The LogMAR UCVA and | EV | between 1 and 6 months showed no significant differences in patients in group A. However , in group B , they are significant differences .",3
The efficacy and stability of Toric-IOL and PCRIs were equal in low astigmatic patients .,4
Toric-IOL achieved an enhanced effect over PCRIs in higher astigmatic patients .,4
PCRIs had the more refractive regression than Toric-IOL in 6 months .,4
"Between Dec 15 , 2010 , and Feb 8 , 2013 , we enrolled 74 patients : 37 were randomly assigned to receive paclitaxel and pazopanib and 37 were randomly assigned to receive paclitaxel only .",3
"One patient , in the paclitaxel only group , withdrew from the study and was excluded from analyses .",3
Median follow-up was 161 months ( IQR 125-208 ) .,3
Progression-free survival was significantly longer in the pazopanib plus paclitaxel group than in the paclitaxel only group ( median 635 months [ 95 % CI 536-1102 ] vs 349 months [ 201-566 ] ; hazard ratio 042 [ 95 % CI 025-069 ] ; p = 00002 ) .,3
We recorded no unexpected toxic effects or deaths from toxic effects .,3
Adverse events were more common in the pazopanib and paclitaxel group than in the paclitaxel only group .,3
"The most common grade 3-4 adverse events were neutropenia ( 11 [ 30 % ] in the pazopanib group vs one [ 3 % ] in the paclitaxel group ) , fatigue ( four [ 11 % ] vs two [ 6 % ] ) , leucopenia ( four [ 11 % ] vs one [ 3 % ] ) , hypertension ( three [ 8 % ] vs none [ 0 % ] ) , raised aspartate aminotransferase or alanine aminotransferase ( three [ 8 % ] vs none ) , and anaemia ( two [ 5 % ] vs five [ 14 % ] ) .",3
One patient in the pazopanib group had ileal perforation .,3
Our findings suggest that a phase 3 study of the combination of weekly paclitaxel plus pazopanib for patients with platinum-resistant or platinum-refractory advanced ovarian cancer is warranted .,4
"The incidence of mood disorder in the folic acid and placebo groups were 14.3 % and 17.9 % respectively , a non-significant difference .",3
"However , there was post-hoc evidence that folic acid delayed the time to onset of mood disorder in those participants who became unwell .",3
Small sample size and rate of onset of mood disorders lower than expected .,4
"Although long term folic acid supplementation was well tolerated , with high levels of adherence , there was no evidence that it reduced the incidence of mood disorder compared to those taking placebo .",4
We randomly assigned 50 villages to the intervention group and 50 villages to the control group .,3
"There were 4586 households ( 24,969 individuals ) in intervention villages and 4894 households ( 25,982 individuals ) in control villages .",3
"The intervention increased mean village-level latrine coverage from 9 % of households to 63 % , compared with an increase from 8 % to 12 % in control villages .",3
"Health surveillance data were obtained from 1437 households with children younger than 5 years in the intervention group ( 1919 children younger than 5 years ) , and from 1465 households ( 1916 children younger than 5 years ) in the control group .",3
"7-day prevalence of reported diarrhoea in children younger than 5 years was 88 % in the intervention group and 91 % in the control group ( period prevalence ratio 097 , 95 % CI 083-112 ) .",3
162 participants died in the intervention group ( 11 children younger than 5 years ) and 151 died in the control group ( 13 children younger than 5 years ) .,3
"Increased latrine coverage is generally believed to be effective for reducing exposure to faecal pathogens and preventing disease ; however , our results show that this outcome can not be assumed .",4
"As efforts to improve sanitation are being undertaken worldwide , approaches should not only meet international coverage targets , but should also be implemented in a way that achieves uptake , reduces exposure , and delivers genuine health gains .",4
19 general practices were randomised to collaborative care and 20 to usual care ; three practices withdrew from the trial before patients were recruited .,3
"191 patients were recruited from practices allocated to collaborative care , and 196 from practices allocated to usual care .",3
"After adjustment for baseline depression score , mean depressive scores were 0.23 SCL-D13 points lower ( 95 % confidence interval -0.41 to -0.05 ) in the collaborative care arm , equal to an adjusted standardised effect size of 0.30 .",3
"Patients in the intervention arm also reported being better self managers , rated their care as more patient centred , and were more satisfied with their care .",3
"There were no significant differences between groups in quality of life , disease specific quality of life , self efficacy , disability , and social support .",3
Collaborative care that incorporates brief low intensity psychological therapy delivered in partnership with practice nurses in primary care can reduce depression and improve self management of chronic disease in people with mental and physical multimorbidity .,4
The size of the treatment effects were modest and were less than the prespecified effect but were achieved in a trial run in routine settings with a deprived population with high levels of mental and physical multimorbidity .,4
"In the placebo arm , the incidence of malaria was 0.34 episodes per person-year and the prevalence of parasitemia and anemia was 38 % and 20 % , respectively .",3
"IPTm reduced the incidence of malaria by 96 % ( 95 % confidence interval [ CI ] , 88 % -99 % , P < .0001 ) , the prevalence of asymptomatic parasitemia by 94 % ( 95 % CI , 92 % -96 % , P < .0001 ) , and the prevalence of anemia by 40 % ( 95 % CI , 19 % -56 % , P < .0001 ) .",3
"IPTst had no significant effect on the incidence of symptomatic malaria or the prevalence of anemia , but reduced the prevalence of asymptomatic parasitemia by 54 % ( 95 % CI , 47 % -60 % , P < .0001 ) .",3
"Monthly IPT with DP offered remarkable protection against clinical malaria , parasitemia , and anemia in schoolchildren living in a high-malaria-transmission setting .",4
Baseline characteristics were similar in the two groups .,3
"After 3 treatment , pain intensity on NRS decreased compared with Baseline ( -1.67 , 95 % confidence interval [ CI ] -1.46 to-1 .87 ) in the electroacupuncture group ; there was little change ( -0.13 , 95 % CI 0.08 to-0 .35 ) in control group ; the difference between two groups was statistically significant ( P < 0.001 ) .",3
Follow-up also found a significant reduction in pain intensity in the electroacupuncture group compared with the control group ( P < 0.001 ) .,3
Electroacupuncture was an effective treatment for relieving pancreatic cancer pain .,4
Haemonchus contortus was the predominant species .,3
Efficacy < 95 % was recorded on 85 % of farms for one or more anthelmintics and on 10 % of farms for six anthelmintics .,3
No resistance was identified on three farms .,3
The 4-way combination product was efficacious ( n = 4 farms ) .,3
Napthalophos resistance was detected on one farm only .,3
"Resistance to levamisole ( 42 % of farms ) , moxidectin injection ( 50 % of farms ) and the closantel/abamectin combination ( 67 % of farms ) was identified .",3
"Moxidectin oral was efficacious against Trichostrongylus colubriformis , which was predominant on only one farm .",3
"Of the farms tested , 55 % ran meat breeds , 60 % dosed more than the recommended dose rate and 70 % always , mostly or when possible practised a ` drench and move ' strategy .",3
This level of anthelmintic resistance in southern Queensland will severely compromise worm control and force increased use of monepantel .,4
"Eighty patients participated in the study , 40 in each group .",3
The mean age in the PNB group was 3.1 ( 1.1 ) years and in the CB group was 3.2 ( 1.1 ) years .,3
"The mean weights in the PNB and CB groups were 15.3 ( 2.8 ) kg and 15.3 ( 2.2 ) kg , respectively .",3
"The percentage of patients who received analgesics during the first 24 hours were significantly higher in the CB ( 70 % ) compared with the PNB group ( 20 % , P < 0.0001 ) .",3
"The average amount of analgesics consumed per patient within 24 hours postoperatively was higher in the CB group ( paracetamol P < 0.0001 , Tramal P = 0.003 ) .",3
Patients who received PNB had reduced analgesic consumption and pain within the first 24 hours postoperatively compared with CB .,4
A total of 302 women were enrolled in 4 health care centers in Yaound and the surrounding countryside .,3
301 women ( 149 in the `` control group '' and 152 in the `` intervention group '' ) completed the full process and were included into the analysis .,3
"Participants who received the educational intervention had a significantly higher knowledge about HPV and cervical cancer than the control group ( p < 0.05 ) , but no significant difference on Self-HPV acceptability and confidence in the method was noticed between the two groups .",3
Educational intervention promotes an increase in knowledge about HPV and cervical cancer .,4
Further investigation should be conducted to determine if this intervention can be sustained beyond the short term and influences screening behavior .,4
Patients were followed up for a median of 8.3 months .,3
Median total implanted activity of ( 90 ) Y was 1.87 ( range : 0.54-2 .35 ) GBq .,3
Patients received a similar intensity and duration of sorafenib in the combination-treatment arm ( median daily dose 614 mg over 8.5 months ) and control arm ( 557 mg over 9.6 months ) .,3
The incidence of total ( 196 vs. 222 ) and grade 3 ( 43 vs. 47 ) adverse events was similar in combination-treatment arm and control arm respectively ( P > 0.05 ) .,3
"No significant differences in the number of total or grade 3/4 toxicities were recorded for : total bilirubin , albumin , liver enzymes , ascites , Child-Pugh , fatigue , hand-foot skin reaction , blood pressure or diarrhoea .",3
Radioembolization followed by sorafenib appears to be as well tolerated as sorafenib alone .,4
We performed liver resections in 260 patients with hepatobiliary malignancies .,3
"Between the subcutaneous-drainage group ( n = 131 ) and non-drainage group ( n = 129 ) , there were no significant differences in the operative variables .",3
Wound infection occurred in 10 drainage group patients ( 8 % ) and 12 patients ( 9 % ) in the non-drainage group ( P = 0.629 ) ; there was no significant difference in the probability of wound infection ( P = 0.624 ) .,3
"No significant differences were found between the groups for the hospital stay duration ( P = 0.363 ) , postoperative complications ( P = 0.725 ) or medical expenses ( P = 0.360 ) .",3
"Subcutaneous drainage does not prevent wound infections in patients undergoing liver resection ; therefore , its routine use is not justified .",4
"A main effect of condition was found for 6 MWD , and an interaction of condition BMI was found for HR and RPE , and of time BMI for 6 MWD and SpO2 .",3

There were no serious side effects apart from leucopenia requiring treatment ( docetaxel + prednisone + cyclophosphamide arm ) and no drug-related withdrawals ; all three fatalities were considered to be cancer related .,3
The oncological effectiveness and tolerability of docetaxel plus prednisone were supported ; an additional effect of cyclophosphamide was not detected .,4
"However , the small number of patients and short observation period restrict the generalisability of the results .",4
"All three groups had significant improvements in all of the pain scores , the severity of muscle spasms , function assessments , and certain subparameters of the quality of life scale ( P < 0.05 ) .",3
The continuous ultrasound group had significantly greater improvements in pain at rest ( P < 0.05 ) .,3
"However , no statistically significant differences were observed in the other parameters ( P > 0.05 ) .",3
Continuous ultrasound therapy is more efficient in reducing pain at rest for myofascial pain syndrome patients than is sham or pulsed ultrasound therapy .,4

Progressive intracranial haemorrhage was present in 21 ( 18 % ) of 120 patients allocated to TXA and in 32 ( 27 % ) of 118 patients allocated to placebo .,3
The difference was not statistically significant [ RR = 0.65 ( 95 % CI 0.40 to 1.05 ) ] .,3
There were no significant difference in the risk of death from all causes in patients allocated to TXA compared with placebo [ RR = 0.69 ( 95 % CI 0.35 to 1.39 ) ] and the risk of unfavourable outcome on the Glasgow Outcome Scale [ RR = 0.76 ( 95 % CI 0.46 to 1.27 ) ] .,3
There was no evidence of increased risk of thromboembolic events in those patients allocated to TXA .,3
"TXA may reduce PIH in patients with TBI ; however , the difference was not statistically significant in this trial .",4
Large clinical trials are needed to confirm and to assess the effect of TXA on death or disability after TBI .,4
VAS scores indicated that none of the test foods exerted an improved effect on satiety feelings .,3
"However , energy intake of individuals during ad libitum lunch was significantly lower in dark chocolate groups ( CON : 849.46 47.45 kcal versus DARK : 677.69 48.45 kcal and B-GLU + DARK : 691.08 47.45 kcal , p = 0.014 ) .",3

"The intervention increased uptake of the first ( first-time invitees : 28.4 % vs. 19.6 % , odds ratio [ OR ] = 1.63 , 95 % confidence interval [ CI ; 1.08 , 2.47 ] ; previous nonattenders : 23.6 % vs. 10.4 % , OR = 2.65 , 95 % CI [ 1.61 , 4.38 ] ) and third ( first-time invitees : 22.4 % vs. 12 % , OR = 2.15 , 95 % CI [ 1.32 , 3.50 ] ; previous nonattenders : 12.4 % vs. 3 % , OR = 4.28 , 95 % CI [ 1.92 , 9.55 ] ) vaccinations .",3
Impacts were not moderated by deprivation level .,3
Decision quality was unaffected by the intervention .,3
"Although the intervention increased completion of HPV vaccinations , uptake remained lower than the national target , which , in addition to cost effectiveness and acceptability issues , necessitates consideration of other ways of achieving it .",4
No statistically significant difference in incidence and degree of corneal neovascularization developing after penetrating keratoplasty was found between treatment groups and placebo group .,3
Mean corneal neovascularization area at week 52 ( visit 12 ) was 2.321.79 % in treatment group A versus placebo ( 2.792.11 % ; P = 0.45 ) and 2.742.22 % in treatment group B versus placebo ( 2.792.11 % ; P = 0.94 ) .,3
High-dose subconjunctival CsA implants do not significantly affect corneal neovascularization after high-risk penetrating keratoplasty .,4

"At 1 year , all-cause mortality rates ( 6.7 % versus 5.9 % ) were similar for PI and pPCI-treated patients ( P = 0.49 ; risk ratio , 1.13 ; 95 % confidence interval , 0.79-1 .62 ) .",3
"Cardiac mortality rates were similar as well ( 4.0 % versus 4.1 % , P = 0.93 ; risk ratio , 0.98 ; 95 % confidence interval , 0.62-1 .54 ) .",3
"Overall , only 34 patients died between day 30 and 1 year , 20 in the PI arm and 14 in the pPCI arm , of whom 20 died of noncardiac reasons ( 13 in the PI and 7 in the pPCI arm ) .",3
There was no significant difference in 1-year all-cause mortality between the 2 groups among the prespecified key subgroups .,3

"Overall , the difference between Pmes and Pest was -0.95 % ( 95 % CI : -10.4 % , +8.5 % ) for all trials and 0.24 % ( -6.1 % , +6.6 % ) in conditions without wind ( < 2 m/s ) .",3
The relationship between percent slope and the error between Pest and Pmes were considered trivial .,3
"Aerodynamic drag ( affected by wind velocity and orientation , frontal area , drafting , and speed ) is the most confounding factor .",4
"The mean estimated values are close to the power-output values measured by power meters , but the random error is between 6 % and 10 % .",4
"Moreover , at the power outputs ( > 400 W ) produced by professional riders , this error is likely to be higher .",4
This observation calls into question the validity of releasing individual values without reporting the range of random errors .,4
The primary outcome could be measured in 82 intervention group participants and 90 control group participants resulting in mean values of 20.4 ( SD 14.4 ) compared to 20.8 ( SD 14.7 ) and a mean difference of -0.2 ( CI 95 % -4.5 to 4.1 ) .,3
A structured information intervention additional to standard care during ICU stay had no demonstrated additional benefit compared to an unspecific communication of similar duration .,4

"Mean blood pressure was 167 ( SD 19 ) mm Hg/90 ( 13 ) mm Hg at baseline ( median 26 h [ 16-37 ] after stroke onset ) , and was significantly reduced on day 1 in 2000 patients allocated to glyceryl trinitrate compared with 2011 controls ( difference -70 [ 95 % CI -85 to -56 ] mm Hg / -35 [ -44 to -26 ] mm Hg ; both p < 00001 ) , and on day 7 in 1053 patients allocated to continue antihypertensive drugs compared with 1044 patients randomised to stop them ( difference -95 [ 95 % CI -118 to -72 ] mm Hg / -50 [ -64 to -37 ] mm Hg ; both p < 00001 ) .",3
"Functional outcome at day 90 did not differ in either treatment comparison-the adjusted common odds ratio ( OR ) for worse outcome with glyceryl trinitrate versus no glyceryl trinitrate was 101 ( 95 % CI 091-113 ; p = 083 ) , and with continue versus stop antihypertensive drugs OR was 105 ( 090-122 ; p = 055 ) .",3
"In patients with acute stroke and high blood pressure , transdermal glyceryl trinitrate lowered blood pressure and had acceptable safety but did not improve functional outcome .",4
We show no evidence to support continuing prestroke antihypertensive drugs in patients in the first few days after acute stroke .,4
"Omron and mercury measurements were correlated ( r = 0.92 , systolic BP ; r = 0.79 , diastolic BP ) .",3
"Overall , the mean between-device differences ( Omron and mercury ) were -1.6 mm Hg for systolic and -0.6 mm Hg for diastolic ( p < 0.05 for both ) .",3
"The mean between-device differences were less than or about 2 mm Hg for each subgroup : gender , age group , race and ethnicity , and body mass index categories , and cuff-size subgroups .",3
"The exceptions were mean systolic between-device differences for those using the extra-large BP cuff ( -3.1 mm Hg ) and obese individuals ( -2.6 mm Hg ) , and the mean diastolic between-device differences for the underweight group ( -3.5 mm Hg ) .",3
"Assuming mercury to be the gold standard , between-device agreements for the frequency of high BP ( 140/90 mm Hg or more ) and stage II high BP ( 160/100 mm Hg or more ) were above chance ( kappa = 0.72 for both ) .",3
Omron underestimated the high BP frequency by 2.28 % and stage II high BP frequency by 0.77 % .,3
Lower estimates of high BP by the Omron device may require adjusting future national prevalence estimates accordingly to account for between-device differences .,4

"Of the 18 participants eligible for this study , 12 had no history of tendinopathy ( NORM ) and 6 had a history of patellar or hamstring tendinopathy ( TEN ) .",3
"Differences in baseline UTC echopattern were observed between the NORM and TEN groups , with the Achilles of the TEN group exhibiting altered UTC echopattern , consistent with a slightly disorganised tendon structure .",3
"In the NORM group , a significant reduction in echo-type I ( normal tendon structure ) was seen on day 2 ( p = 0.012 ) that returned to baseline on day 4 .",3
There was a transient change in UTC echopattern in the Achilles tendon as a result of an Australian football game in individuals without a history of lower limb tendinopathy .,4
"Of 137 SDMs ( 162 eligibility events ) , 67 and 70 were randomized to MD and non-MD introductions , respectively .",3
"Eighty SDMs ( 98 events ) provided consent and 21 SDMs ( 24 events ) declined consent for studies , including 2 SDMs who provided and declined consent .",3
"We identified few missed introductions [ 4/52 ( 7.7 % ) ] and protocol violations [ 6/117 ( 5.1 % ) ] , high comfort , satisfaction and acceptance scores and similar consent rates in both arms .",3
SDMs provided consent significantly more often when a patient update was provided in the MD arm .,3
"Most SDMs ( 85.7 % ) felt that physician involvement was inconsequential and preferred physician time to be dedicated to patient care ; however , SDM experiences were closely related to their recall of being approached and recall was poor .",3
SDMs highlighted 7 themes of importance to them in research surrogate decision-making .,3
SDMs prioritized the personal attributes of the person approaching them over professional designation and preferred physician time to be dedicated to patient care .,4
"A mixed methods design evaluated intervention fidelity and provided the rationale for not proceeding to a larger trial , despite achieving all feasibility metrics in the pilot trial .",4
"After three years , intervention resulted in a lower increase of BMI ( 1.6 vs. 1.9 Kg/m , p < 0.01 ) and a decreased consumption of total calories , bread , fat and sugar consumption in the schools .",3
"School programs are useful to address childhood obesity , but its benefits are not immediate .",4
"The total effective rate was 96.2 % ( 125/130 ) in the EA group , which was apparently superior to 87.5 % ( 56/64 ) in the indwelling catheter group ( P < 0.05 ) ; except for nocturia frequency in the indwelling catheter group , the total score and the subitem score in the urination diary were all improved significantly after treatment in both groups ( all P < 0.001 ) , which were more obvious in the EA group ( P < 0.001 , P < 0.05 ) ; the patients ' satisfaction and bladder capacity were all improved significantly after treatment in both groups ( all P < 0.001 ) , which were more obvious in the EA group ( both P < 0.001 ) .",3
"The EA has an obvious effect for apoplectic urinary incontinence in urinary incontinence alleviation and bladder capacity increase , which has better efficacy than indwelling catheter therapy .",4
"Compared with baseline PS scores ( median , 4.75 ; range , 0.75 to 8.5 ) , dogs had significantly lower PS scores 2 weeks ( median , 3 ; range , 1 to 5.5 ) and 4 weeks ( median , 2.25 ; range , 0.25 to 7.25 ) after administration of anti-NGF mAb .",3
"Compared with baseline PI scores ( median , 5.33 ; range , 1.17 to 9.33 ) , dogs had significantly lower PI scores 2 weeks ( median , 3 ; range , 0.67 to 6.83 ) and 4 weeks ( median , 3.33 ; range , 0.67 to 6.67 ) after administration of anti-NGF mAb .",3
"The PS and PI scores 6 weeks after mAb administration were lower than baseline scores , although values were not significantly different .",3
Results of this study suggested the evaluated anti-NGF mAb decreased PS and PI scores for 4 weeks after administration .,4
This treatment may be effective for alleviation of signs of pain in dogs with osteoarthritis for up to 4 weeks .,4
Groups A and B showed similar outcomes in terms of stone removal .,3
The short-term and 1-year complication rates were also similar between the two groups .,3
"However , the first-session stone removal rate in group A was significantly higher than that in group B. Mechanical lithotripsy was required significantly more often in group B than in group A.",3

"Among 234 European American participants enrolled in the Pharmacogenomic Evaluation of Antihypertensive Responses ( PEAR ) study and treated with atenolol for 9 weeks , we prospectively followed a nested cohort that had both metabolomics profiling and genotype data available for the development of IFG .",3
"We assessed the association between baseline circulating levels of isoleucine , leucine , valine , tyrosine , and phenylalanine , as well as single-nucleotide polymorphisms in branched-chain amino-acid transaminase 1 ( BCAT1 ) and phenylalanine hydroxylase ( PAH ) with development of IFG .",3
All baseline AA levels were strongly associated with IFG development .,3
"Each increment in standard deviation of the 5 AAs was associated with the following odds ratio and 95 % confidence interval for IFG based on a fully adjusted model : isoleucine 2.29 ( 1.31-4 .01 ) , leucine 1.80 ( 1.10-2 .96 ) , valine 1.77 ( 1.07-2 .92 ) , tyrosine 2.13 ( 1.20-3 .78 ) , and phenylalanine 2.04 ( 1.16-3 .59 ) .",3
The composite P value was 210 ( -5 ) .,3
Those with PAH ( rs2245360 ) AA genotype had the highest incidence of IFG ( P for trend = 0.0003 ) .,3

"Although total referrals from intervention practices was lower than control , subsequent proportions of registrations among smokers referred to Decide2Quit.org were nearly fourfold higher ( adjusted mean percentages : 29.5 % vs 7.6 % , p < 0.01 ) in intervention compared with control practices .",3
"Subsequent rates of cessation among referred smokers were threefold higher ( adjusted mean percentages : 3.0 % vs 0.8 % , p = 0.03 ) in intervention practices as compared with control .",3
Intervention practices using the e-referral system had higher smoker registration numbers and higher quit smoking rates than the control practices .,4
This study finds that e-referrals are effective in getting smokers to the web-assisted smoking-cessation induction system and in assisting with quitting that more than compensates for any additional effort that e-referrals require on the part of the practitioner .,4
"Total bilirubin , albumin , and clinical score showed significant improvement ( p < 0.05 ) 1 week post-infusion , with no significant difference between MNC and CD34 + cell groups .",3
"Four patients ( control , 1 ; MNC , 1 ; CD34 + , 2 ) started at over 18 % ICG-R15 but can be overturned after PVE .",3
"Daily hepatic volume growth ( mL/day ) was 2.5 for MNC and 4.9 for CD34 + groups , resulting in significant increase over controls ( 1.1 ; p < 0.05 ) .",3
We found no correlation between the number of applied CD34 + cells and daily gains in left lateral lobe volume .,3

FM was systematically lower when using SF-BIA than when using BIS .,4
"Fifty-two percent of respondents declared to be more often choosing generics , twenty-three percent did not have any specific preferences , and twenty-five percent were more willing to choose brand-name medicines .",3
"Past experience with cheaper generic medicines , secondary or lower education , low income and residence in specific regions of Poland were all significantly associated with an increased willingness to choose generics .",3
Respondents ' attitudes towards generics were mostly influenced by the opinions of doctors and pharmacists .,3
"According to respondents , attitudes towards generics among doctors , pharmacists , family and friends , and in the mass media were mostly positive .",3
"There was no relationship between the preference of respondents for generics and factors such as their age , life stage , gender , household size or urban/rural locality .",3
"As a result of substituting a brand-name drug with its generic equivalent , 72 % of respondents reported that they had not noticed any difference in drug effectiveness ; 21 % had experienced a reduced effectiveness of treatment or increased side effects at least once ; and 7 % claimed the generic worked better .",3
The majority of respondents who used cheaper substitutes claimed that generics represented good or very good quality .,3
"The study demonstrates that , when choosing medicines , Poles rely mainly on the opinions of their doctors and pharmacists .",4
"Therefore , it is recommended that : ( 1 ) the option of using generics be promoted when writing prescriptions , and ( 2 ) the obligation on pharmacists to inform customers of their option to purchase generics be enforced .",4
"216 ( 106 females , mean age 60.7 9.65 years ) were enrolled .",3
Colonoscopy was performed in 131 patients and upper endoscopy in 85 patients .,3
In 105 patients an NPA was used ( intervention group ) .,3
Five ( 4.7 % ) of those patients showed minor nasopharyngeal injury .,3
"Respiratory depression ( 13.5 vs. 1.9 % , p = 0.002 ) and hypotension ( 11 vs. 5 % , p = 0.09 ) occurred more frequently in the control than in the intervention group .",3
The routine placement of an NPA can reduce the frequency of hypoxemic events during endoscopic sedation with minor risks for nasopharyngeal injury .,4
"In patients with pneumoconiosis , the daytime systolic BP ( SBP ) level was lower , the CV in 24-hour SBP ( P < 0.05 ) and diastolic BP ( P < 0.001 ) were higher than that in control subjects .",3
"And although not statistically significant ( P = 0.13 ) , the odds ratio of riser pattern was 3.73 in patients with pneumoconiosis , and their nighttime pulse rate was significantly higher ( P < 0.05 ) than that in control subjects .",3
The median daytime pulse oximetry oxygen saturation was inversely associated with mean ( r = -0.30 ; P < 0.01 ) and SD ( r = -0.38 ; P < 0.001 ) in daytime SBP .,3
The median nighttime pulse oximetry oxygen saturation was inversely associated ( r = -0.55 ; P < 0.001 ) and the mean nighttime pulse rate was associated ( r = 0.51 ; P < 0.001 ) with CV in nighttime SBP .,3
Partial pressure of oxygen was inversely associated with CV in daytime SBP ( r = -0.24 ; P < 0.05 ) .,3
"Exaggerated BP variability was seen in patients with pneumoconiosis , and the measures of hypoxia were associated with large fluctuations in ambulatory BP .",4
Chronic and intermittent hypoxia could be the contributing factors of these findings .,4
"The shorter samples and the 22-min samples significantly differed in adjusted TNW and NDW , but not in MLCUm .",3
"TNW reached an acceptable reliability level ( i.e. , r = .90 ) in 7-min samples .",3
NDW and MLCUm approached the acceptable reliability level ( rs = .88 ) in 7-min samples and reached it in 10-min samples .,3
"For conversational language samples with similar collection procedures , samples of 7 to 10 min are desirable for calculating TNW , NDW , and MLCUm in 3-year-olds .",4

"No significant differences were found in postoperative pain and painkiller intake ; pain , percentage of patients at work and overall satisfaction at 3 weeks postoperative ; and overall duration of incapacity for work and overall satisfaction at 1-year follow-up .",3
The complication rate was 49 % in group L vs. 12 % in group E ( p < 0.001 ) .,3
"Complications in group L were seroma ( 6 % ) , wound dehiscence ( 45 % ) , skin necrosis ( 10 % ) , hematoma ( 6 % ) , infection ( 4 % ) and recurrent disease ( 13 % ) .",3
Complications in group E were recurrent disease ( 6 % ) and wound healing disorder ( 6 % ) .,3
"After excision of a pilonidal sinus , primary wound closure with a Limberg flap has no advantage over secondary wound healing .",4
The main reason for this conclusion is the relatively high complication rate of primary wound closure with a Limberg flap .,4
"After 10 sessions , the symptom scores , pain index ( PI ) , and visual analog scale ( VAS ) decreased significantly in treatment group .",3
The volume of blood flow in Hegu ( LI 4 ) declined slightly .,3

"Acupuncture can increase the capillary blood flow , thus promoting the flow of Qi and blood in terms ofTCM theory , which facilitates pain relief .",4
It is anticipated that this study will show that DeREACH effectively reduces caregiver burden and therefore works under the conditions of a local German health-care system .,4
"If successful , this programme will provide an effective intervention programme in the German-speaking area to identify and develop the personal capabilities of informal caregivers to cope with the burdens of caring for people with dementia .",4
ICU transfer ( 17.8 % vs 18.2 % ; odds ratio : 0.972 ; 95 % confidence interval [ CI ] : 0.635-1 .490 ) and hospital mortality ( 7.3 % vs 7.7 % ; odds ratio : 0.947 ; 95 % CI : 0.509-1 .764 ) were similar for the intervention and control groups .,3
The number of patients requiring transfer to a nursing home or long-term acute care hospital was similar for patients in the intervention and control groups ( 26.9 % vs 26.3 % ; odds ratio : 1.032 ; 95 % CI : 0.712-1 .495 ) .,3
Hospital duration ( 8.49.5 days vs 9.411.1 days ; P = 0.038 ) was statistically shorter for the intervention group .,3
The number of RRT calls initiated by the primary care team was similar for the intervention and control groups ( 19.9 % vs 16.5 % ; odds ratio : 1.260 ; 95 % CI : 0.823-1 .931 ) .,3
"Real-time alerts sent to the RRT did not reduce ICU transfers , hospital mortality , or the need for subsequent long term care .",4
"However , hospital length of stay was modestly reduced .",4
Volume and pH of gastric contents aspirated from 67 patients ( 34 in Group-C and 33 in Group-NC ) were analyzed .,3
The demographic parameters of the groups were comparable .,3
Gastric volume ( median-interquartile range ) was statistically higher in Group-C ( 13 ml ( 7.75-40 .75 ) vs Group-NC 6 ml ( 1.00-14 .00 ) ( P < 0.001 ) ] .,3
The mean pH in both groups was comparable : 2.84 2.11 in Group-C and 3.79 2.53 in Group-NC ( P = 0.141 ) .,3
"Although our results show gastric volume in patients chewing gum was statistically higher , clinical relevance of such a small difference is questionable .",4
Thus patients who chewed gum inadvertently prior to procedure should not be denied or delayed administration of sedative and anesthetic medications .,4
"A total of 1,086 screened patients recorded personal digital assistant information .",3
Overall 640 patients were randomized to solifenacin vs placebo and 17 failed to take medication .,3
There was no difference in time to continence ( p = 0.17 ) .,3
"Continence was achieved by study end in 91 of 313 ( 29 % ) vs 66 of 309 ( 21 % ) , respectively ( p = 0.04 ) .",3
"Pads per day change from baseline was -3.2 and -2.9 , respectively ( p = 0.03 ) .",3
"Dry mouth was the only common adverse event seen in 6.1 % and 0.6 % , respectively .",3
Constipation rates were similar .,3
The overall rate of continence in the entire population from screening to end of study was 73 % .,3
There was no effect on primary outcome but some secondary end points benefited the solifenacin arm .,4
The study provides level 1B clinical evidence for continence outcomes after robot-assisted radical prostatectomy .,4
"On the basis of this trial , the effect of psychoeducation for individuals on sick leave and at risk of having a mental disorder will be studied .",4
The results will contribute to the continuing research on sickness absence and mental health .,4
It will primarily show whether psychoeducation can lead to faster and sustainable return to work .,4
"In both groups , the improvement in semen analysis parameters and DNA damage was observed , but there was not any statistically significant difference between the 2 groups in these parameters , although the slope of improvement in DNA damage was slightly better in group 2 ( that was not statistically significant ) .",3
We observed that addition of 750 mg of L-carnitine orally daily to standard inguinal varicocelectomy does not add any extra benefit in terms of improvement in semen analysis parameters or DNA damage .,4
Increased levels of stromal TILs predicted pCR in univariable ( P < .001 ) and multivariable analyses ( P < .001 ) .,3
pCR rate was 59.9 % in LPBC and 33.8 % for non-LPBC ( P < .001 ) .,3
"pCR rates 75 % were observed in patients with LPBC tumors treated with PMCb , with a significant test for interaction with therapy in the complete ( P = .002 ) and HER2-positive ( P = .006 ) , but not the TNBC , cohorts .",3
Hierarchic clustering of mRNA markers revealed three immune subtypes with different pCR rates ( P < .001 ) .,3
All 12 immune mRNA markers were predictive for increased pCR .,3
"The highest odds ratios ( ORs ) were observed for PD-L1 ( OR , 1.57 ; 95 % CI , 1.34 to 1.86 ; P < .001 ) and CCL5 ( OR , 1.41 ; 95 % CI , 1.23 to 1.62 ; P < .001 ) .",3
"Immunologic factors were highly significant predictors of therapy response in the GeparSixto trial , particularly in patients treated with Cb .",4
"After further standardization , they could be included in histopathologic assessment of BC .",4
"Of 57 patients registered , 29 were allocated to the S-1 group and 28 to gemcitabine .",3
"DFS tended to be better with S-1 ( median 146 ( 90 per cent c.i. 88 to 284 ) months versus 105 ( 70 to 284 ) months in the gemcitabine group ; P = 0188 ) , with a similar pattern for overall survival : 215 ( 95 per cent c.i. 144 to 423 ) and 180 ( 133 to 428 ) months respectively ( P = 0293 ) .",3
"When patients were divided into subgroups based on high or low DPD and TS expression , those with a DPD level below the median of 088 or a TS level of at least 200 had a significant prolongation of DFS after S-1 treatment compared with gemcitabine ( P = 0008 and P = 0035 respectively ) .",3
"Overall , S-1 did not improve DFS compared with gemcitabine after pancreatic cancer resection , but there seemed to be a DFS advantage in patients with low expression of DPD or high expression of TS .",4
Reference number : UMIN000009118 ( http://www.umin.ac.jp/ctr/ ) .,4
"A total of 127 patients were enrolled in the trial ( DRPM 62 , IPM/CS 65 ) .",3
"The characteristics of the 122 patients evaluated for efficacy were well balanced , except for the percentage of patients previously receiving antimicrobials , which was higher in the DRPM group than in the IPM/CS group .",3
"The clinical response rate was not significantly different between the DRPM group ( 93.1 % , 54/58 patients ) and the IPM/CS group ( 93.8 % , 60/64 ) .",3
Non-inferiority assessment using confidence intervals demonstrated the non-inferiority of DRPM-IPM/CS .,3
"The incidence of adverse events , for which a causal relationship with either treatment was not ruled out , was 3.3 % ( 2/60 ) in the DRPM group and 3.1 % ( 2/65 ) in the IPM/CS group , and none was serious .",3
The clinical efficacy of DRPM in treating moderate or severe biliary tract infection requiring drainage was comparable to that of IPM/CS .,4
DRPM was associated with no serious adverse events and a low incidence of adverse events .,4
The results of this trial demonstrate that DRPM is a useful therapeutic option for moderate or severe biliary tract infection .,4
"We analyzed endometrial thickness in 113 women , baseline IUD position in 114 women and IUD movement in 65 women .",3
"Women who expelled IUDs ( n = 15 ) had slightly thicker endometria ( p = .007 ) and slightly lower baseline IUD positions ( p = .03 ) than those who retained IUDs , but no clear cutoffs emerged in the receiver operating characteristic curve analysis .",3
Retained IUDs commonly moved up and down throughout the 6 months ( from 14 mm towards the fundus to 32 mm towards the cervix ) .,3
"Overall , retained IUDs moved a median of 2mm towards the cervix between insertion and exit ( p < .0001 ) .",3
"After medical abortion , the risk of IUD expulsion increases with thicker endometria and lower baseline position .",4
"Since no clear cutoffs emerged in the analysis and expulsion remained uncommon even with thicker endometria , we do not recommend restricting IUD insertion based on ultrasound data .",4
Copper T IUDs often move within the uterus without expelling .,4
"Expulsion is uncommon , and we do not recommend restricting IUD insertion based on ultrasound data .",4
"Global effects of each gene and gene-diet interactions for different fats , total fat , and carbohydrate were evaluated .",3
"Global tests revealed no main effects between SCAP , INSIG1 , and SREBP1 haplotypes and progression of atherosclerosis ( P = .87 , P = .58 , and P = .44 ) .",3
"After correction for 5 nutrients evaluated ( Bonferroni-corrected 2-tailed = .01 ) , no significant gene-nutrient interactions were seen , except for a borderline global interaction between SREBP1 and PUFA intake ( P interaction = .013 ) .",3
This interaction was specific to the G-C haplotype ( frequency 35 % ) and was driven by n-6 rather than n-3 PUFA ( P for interaction < .0001 ) .,3
The interaction was robust to estimated isocaloric replacement of PUFA with any other nutrient .,3
"Per each 5 % energy from n-6 PUFA , a 0.21-mm greater decline in mean minimal coronary artery diameter was seen among women per each copy of the second most frequent haplotype of SREBP1 .",3
We observed an interaction between SREBP1 and PUFA consumption that might explain the positive association of PUFA with atherosclerosis progression in this cohort .,4
"Participants reported drinking a mean of 13 Australian standard drinks on their last episode of risky , single-occasion drinking ; for half of the participants , this occurred less than 20 days prior to being surveyed .",3
The majority ( 62 % ) of risky single occasion drinking sessions commenced at private homes in the company of close friends ( 81 % ) .,3
"Around 40 % of the sample reported going to one ( 42 % ) or two ( 37 % ) drinking locations , and only 5 % reported going to more than three drinking locations .",3
"Contrary to public portrayals , a significant amount of risky drinking by young people occurs in private settings .",4
These contexts are rarely mentioned except in relation to underage drinking .,4
Further work is needed to understand how these drinking behaviours and contexts link to harm .,4
"Compared with arm C , the average intraoperative intravenous infusion quantity in arm G was significantly reduced ( 2,732488 mL versus 3,135346 mL , P < 0.05 ) , whereas average colloid fluid volume was significantly increased ( 1,235360 mL versus 760280 mL , P < 0.05 ) .",3
"In addition , there were more patients exhibiting intraoperatively and postoperatively stable hemodynamics and less patients with low blood pressure in arm G. Postoperative complications were less frequent , and the time of postoperative hospital stay shorter , in arm G. No significant differences were observed in mortality between the two arms .",3
Our research showed that GDFT stabilized perioperative hemodynamics and reduced the occurrence of postoperative complications in elderly patients who underwent gastric cancer surgery .,4
Subjects were exposed to an average airborne concentration up to 4.310 ( 5 ) particles/cm ( 3 ) ( average geometric size 60-80nm ) .,3
"Up to 1010 ( 8 ) particles/mL could be measured in the collected EBC with a broad size distribution ( 50 ( th ) percentile 160nm ) , but these biological concentrations were not related to the exposure level of cigarette smoke particles .",3
"Although H ( 2 ) O ( 2 ) and MDA concentrations in EBC increased during exposure , only H2O2 showed a transient normalization 1hr after exposure and increased afterward .",3
"In contrast , MDA levels stayed elevated during the 2hr post exposure .",3
"The use of diffusion light scattering for particle counting proved to be sufficiently sensitive to detect objects in EBC , but lacked the specificity for carbonaceous tobacco smoke particles .",4
"Our results suggest two phases of oxidation markers in EBC : first , the initial deposition of particles and gases in the lung lining liquid , and later the start of oxidative stress with associated cell membrane damage .",4
Future studies should extend the follow-up time and should remove gases or particles from the air to allow differentiation between the different sources of H ( 2 ) O ( 2 ) and MDA .,4
"At baseline , glucose levels 2 hours after glucose intake were elevated in both groups .",3
"Whereas area under the glucose curve did not change , area under the insulin curve decreased following training ( EX , -13 23 % vs CON , +22 33 % ; P < .05 ) .",3
Changes in the ratio of mitral peak velocity of early filling/early diastolic mitral annular velocity and waist-to-hip fat mass ratio were related to changes in the insulin curve .,3
"Exercise training resulted in improved oxygen uptake at the second ventilatory threshold ( EX , +10 5 % vs CON , -8 5 % ; P < .05 ) and isokinetic strength endurance of the upper leg ( EX , +25 9 % vs CON , -6 5 % ; P < 0.05 ) .",3
Lean body tissue was increased by 2.2 0.5 % in EX versus 0.2 0.6 % in CON ( P < .05 ) .,3
Our data suggest that exercise training attenuates worsening of glucose regulation typically seen in a stable CHF population .,4
"The analysis comprised 2110 patients with SBP < 115 mmHg , 1968 with 115 SBP < 130 mmHg , and 2427 with SBP 130 mmHg .",3
"Patients with low SBP were younger , had lower ejection fraction , and were less likely to be at target beta-blocker dose than patients in the other SBP groups .",3
"Ivabradine was associated with a similar relative risk reduction of the composite outcome in the three SBP groups [ SBP < 115 mmHg , hazard ratio ( HR ) = 0.84 , 95 % confidence interval ( CI ) 0.72-0 .98 ; 115 SBP < 130 mmHg , HR = 0.86 , 95 % CI 0.72 to 1.03 ; SBP 130 mmHg , HR = 0.77 , 95 % CI 0.66 to 0.92 ; P interaction = 0.68 ] .",3
"Similar results were found for cardiovascular mortality ( P interaction = 0.91 ) , hospitalization because of heart failure ( P interaction = 0.79 ) , all-cause mortality ( P interaction = 0.90 ) , and heart failure mortality ( P interaction = 0.18 ) .",3
There was no evidence for a difference in safety profile according to SBP group .,3
The efficacy and safety of ivabradine is independent of SBP .,4
This may have implications for the management of HF patients with low SBP and elevated heart rate .,4
"Among 9,572 patients , SD and ASV were significantly lower with atorvastatin 80 mg/day versus 10 mg/day ( SD : 12.03 9.70 vs. 12.52 7.43 ; p = 0.005 ; ASV : 12.84 10.48 vs. 13.76 8.69 ; p < 0.0001 ) .",3
"In the adjusted model , each 1-SD increase in LDL-C variability ( by ASV ) increased the risk of any coronary event by 16 % ( hazard ratio [ HR ] : 1.16 ; 95 % confidence interval [ CI ] : 1.10 to 1.23 ; p < 0.0001 ) , any cardiovascular event by 11 % ( HR : 1.11 ; 95 % CI : 1.07 to 1.15 ; p < 0.0001 ) , death by 23 % ( HR : 1.23 ; 95 % CI : 1.14 to 1.34 ; p < 0.0001 ) , myocardial infarction by 10 % ( HR : 1.10 ; 95 % CI : 1.02 to 1.19 ; p = 0.02 ) , and stroke by 17 % ( HR : 1.17 ; 95 % CI : 1.04 to 1.31 ; p = 0.01 ) , independent of treatment effect and achieved LDL-C levels .",3
Results were largely consistent when adjusted for medication adherence .,3
"In subjects with coronary artery disease , visit-to-visit LDL-C variability is an independent predictor of cardiovascular events .",4
"Significant between-group differences in favor of VNS + BMP were observed regarding improvement in HRQoL , seizure frequency , and CGI-I score ( respective p-values < 0.05 , 0.03 , and 0.01 ) .",3
"More patients in the VNS + BMP group ( 43 % ) reported adverse events ( AEs ) versus BMP group ( 21 % ) ( p = 0.01 ) , a difference reflecting primarily mostly transient AEs related to VNS implantation or stimulation .",3
"No significant difference between treatment groups was observed for changes in CES-D , NDDI-E , AEP , and AED load .",3
VNS therapy as a treatment adjunct to BMP in patients with pharmacoresistant focal seizures was associated with a significant improvement in HRQoL compared with BMP alone .,4

Patients with ST-segment-elevation myocardial infarction 12 hours undergoing primary percutaneous coronary intervention of a single de novo native lesion were randomized to the MGuard versus any commercially available metallic stent ( 39.8 % drug-eluting ) .,3
"Clinical follow-up was performed through 1 year , and angiography at 13 months was planned in 50 MGuard patients .",3
There was no difference in major adverse cardiac events ( 1.8 % versus 2.3 % ; P = 0.75 ) at 30 days between the groups .,3
"Major adverse cardiac events at 1 year were higher with the MGuard , driven by greater ischemia-driven target lesion revascularization ( 8.6 % versus 0.9 % ; P = 0.0003 ) .",3
"Conversely , mortality tended to be lower with the MGuard at 30 days ( 0 % versus 1.9 % ; P = 0.04 ) and at 1 year ( 1.0 % versus 3.3 % ; P = 0.09 ) .",3
"Late lumen loss at 13 months in the MGuard was 0.990.80 mm , and binary restenosis was 31.6 % .",3
"In patients with ST-segment-elevation myocardial infarction undergoing primary percutaneous coronary intervention , a trend toward reduced 1-year mortality was present in patients treated with the MGuard stent .",4
"Target lesion revascularization and major adverse cardiac events rates during follow-up were higher in the MGuard group than in the control stent group , and angiographic late loss of the MGuard was consistent with that expected from bare metal stents .",4
Serum cortisol levels and the cortisol/DHEA-S ratio were significantly decreased in the L-ornithine group in comparison with the placebo group .,3
"Also , anger was reduced and perceived sleep quality was improved in the L-ornithine group .",3
"L-ornithine supplementation has the potential to relieve stress and improve sleep quality related to fatigue , both objectively and subjectively .",4
"In 189 randomly assigned patients , treatment arms were well balanced with regard to clinical characteristics .",3
The 3-month PFS was significantly improved with the addition of ziv-aflibercept in patients who had platinum-refractory disease ( 27 % v 10 % ; P = .02 ) but not in patients with platinum-sensitive disease ( 24 % v 15 % ; P = .22 ) .,3
"Although response rate was low , disease control rate was higher with combination therapy than with topotecan alone in patients who had platinum-sensitive disease ( 37 % v 18 % ; P = .05 ) and in those who had platinum-refractory disease ( 25 % v 15 % ; P = .14 ) .",3
Overall survival ( OS ) was not significantly improved in either strata .,3
Grades 3 to 5 toxicities were more common with the addition of ziv-aflibercept .,3
"Ziv-aflibercept improved the 3-month PFS in patients who had platinum-refractory SCLC , but its addition increased toxicity .",4
OS was similar with combined ziv-aflibercept and topotecan compared with topotecan in both strata .,4
New or larger UMIs were detected in 37 participants during follow-up .,3
"Plasma concentrations of hs-cTnI at 70 years of age , which were mainly within what is considered to be the reference interval , were related to new or larger UMIs at 75 years of age with an odds ratio of 1.98 per 1 unit increase in ln-transformed cTnI ( 95 % CI , 1.17-3 .35 ; P = 0.010 ) .",3
Plasma concentrations of hs-cTnI at 70 years of age were associated with the volumes of the UMIs detected at 75 years of age ( P = 0.028 ) .,3
hs-cTnI in 70-year-old community-living women and men was associated with the development of MRI-detected UMIs within 5 years .,4
We examined 196 770 AHF admissions from the Acute Decompensated Heart Failure National Registry-United States and Acute Decompensated Heart Failure National Registry-International registries .,3
"Patients were considered RELAX-AHF-type if they met the following criteria : discharge diagnosis of heart failure , systolic blood pressure > 125 mm Hg , dyspnea at rest or with mild exertion , intravenous diuretic use , glomerular filtration rate of 30 to 75 mL/min per 1.73 m ( 2 ) , hemoglobin > 8 g/dL , and no use of intravenous inotropes or vasopressors .",3
Baseline characteristics and treatments of RELAX-AHF-type and non-RELAX-AHF-type patients were compared .,3
A Cox model was used to evaluate inpatient mortality .,3
"Among both Acute Decompensated Heart Failure National Registry-United States and Acute Decompensated Heart Failure National Registry-International registries , 20.7 % ( n = 38 485 ) and 16.2 % ( n = 1749 ) of patients met basic criteria for RELAX-AHF entry , respectively .",3
"These patients were more likely to be older , be women , have a previous history of hypertension , have preserved ejection fraction , and have better renal function .",3
"In-hospital mortality was lower in RELAX-AHF-type than in non-RELAX-AHF-type patients , even after multivariable adjustment ( hazard ratio , 0.59 ; 95 % confidence interval , 0.53-0 .66 ; P < 0.0001 ) .",3
"Patients potentially eligible for RELAX-AHF represent 2 in 10 patients with AHF in the United States , Latin America , or Asia-Pacific .",4
These patients differ significantly from other hospitalized patients based on clinical characteristics and outcomes .,4
Both blocked and random groups had significantly higher FLS and hand-motion efficiency scores over baseline on post-tests for each task ( P < .05 ) and higher overall FLS scores than controls on retention tests ( P < .01 ) .,3
No difference was seen between the blocked and random groups in the amount of skill acquired or skill retained .,3
Both blocked and random training schedules can be considered as valid training options to allow programs and learners to tailor training to their individual needs .,4
"Age and tanner score were inversely associated with all biomarkers ( BALP , OC , NTX/Cr ) ( P < 0.001 ) .",3
Males had higher BALP and OC than females ( P < 0.001 ) .,3
Body mass index ( BMI ) was inversely associated with OC and NTX/Cr ( P < 0.001 ) .,3
"There was no significant association of biomarkers with lifestyle related factors , ALL treatment-related factors , dietary calcium , vitamin D , or LS-BMD Z-score .",3
"In this population of long-term survivors of ALL , bone turnover was significantly associated with age , gender , tanner stage , and BMI .",4
ALL-related treatments did not influence bone turnover and bone turnover was not predictive of volumetric LS-BMD Z-score .,4
There were 23 cases of confirmed 2009 pandemic influenza A ( H1N1 ) ( A [ H1N1 ] pdm09 ) infection for the primary relative VE analysis .,3
"The VE in the Ad2 group relative to that in the NAd2 group was 76.8 % ( 95 % confidence interval , 18.5 % -93.4 % ) .",3
"The benefit of the AS03 adjuvant was demonstrated in terms of the greater immunogenicity observed in the Ad2 group , compared with the NAd2 group .",3
"The 4-8-fold antigen-sparing adjuvanted pandemic influenza vaccine demonstrated superior and clinically important prevention of A ( H1N1 ) pdm09 infection , compared with nonadjuvanted vaccine , with no observed increase in medically attended or serious adverse events .",4
These data support the use of adjuvanted influenza vaccines during influenza pandemics .,4
Clinical Trials Registration .,4
NCT01051661 .,4
"After a mean follow-up of 2.25 0.67 years ( range 1.5-3 years ) , both groups showed a significant decrease in IOP ( p < 0.05 ) .",3
"There was no difference in IOP between groups except at the 18-month interval , when IOP in IVB group was significantly lower ( 14.57 1.72 mmHg vs. 18.37 1.06 mmHg - p = 0.0002 ) .",3
There was no difference in survival success rates between groups .,3
"At 24 months , there was a trend to patients treated with IVB using less antiglaucoma medications than the control group ( p = 0.0648 ) .",3
Complete regression of rubeosis iridis was significantly more frequent in the IVB group ( 80 % ) than in the control group ( 25 % ) ( p = 0.0015 ) .,3
Intravitreal bevacizumab may lead to regression of new vessels both in the iris and in the anterior chamber angle in patients with neovascular glaucoma undergoing Ahmed glaucoma valve implantation .,4
There is a trend to slightly lower IOPs and number of medications with IVB use during AGV implantation for neovascular glaucoma .,4
Both Ktrans and kep values for NPC tumor tissues decreased for both groups after treatment .,3
"Moreover , a statistically significant difference in Ktrans values at the pre-therapy and post-therapy timepoints emerged earlier for the combined treatment group ( RT 50 Gy , P = 0.045 ) compared to the radiotherapy alone group ( 3 months post-RT , P = 0.032 ) .",3
"For the kep values , the downward trend observed for both the combined treatment group and the radiotherapy alone group were similar .",3
"In contrast , ve values for all of the tumor tissues increased following therapy .",3
The EBV-LMP1-targeted DNAzyme that was tested was found to accelerate the decline of Ktrans values for patients with NPC .,4
"Correspondingly , the LMP1-targeted DNAzyme treatments were found to affect the angiogenesis and microvascular permeability of NPC .",4
"During a median follow-up of 7.1 years ( interquartile range , 5.1-8 .8 years ; maximum 12.4 years ) , the primary end point occurred in 30 patients in the stenting group compared with 18 patients in the endarterectomy group .",3
"Cumulative probabilities of this outcome were 11.0 % ( 95 % confidence interval , 7.9-15 .2 ) versus 6.3 % ( 4.0-9 .8 ) in the endarterectomy group at the 5-year follow-up ( hazard ratio , 1.85 ; 1.00-3 .40 ; P = 0.04 ) and 11.5 % ( 8.2-15 .9 ) versus 7.6 % ( 4.9-11 .8 ; hazard ratio , 1.70 ; 0.95-3 .06 ; P = 0.07 ) at the 10-year follow-up .",3
"No difference was observed between treatment groups in the rates of ipsilateral stroke beyond the procedural period , severe carotid restenosis ( 70 % ) or occlusion , death , myocardial infarction , and revascularization procedures .",3
"The long-term benefit-risk balance of carotid stenting versus endarterectomy for symptomatic carotid stenosis favored endarterectomy , a difference driven by a lower risk of procedural stroke after endarterectomy .",4
Both techniques were associated with low and similar long-term risks of recurrent ipsilateral stroke beyond the procedural period .,4
"Forty-nine patients ( 33 men and 16 women ) , with a mean age of 46 years , participated in the study .",3
"In both groups , there was a statistically significant average increase of volume in the facial area measured by computed tomography between the baseline and the 2 - and 12-month posttreatment assessments .",3
"All cases showed an improvement of the clinical facial atrophy grade after treatment , which was statistically significant .",3
This improvement was related to a statistically significant fat volume increase measured by means of computed tomography .,3
There was no difference in the volume gain between both groups .,3
No major complications were observed .,3
"Fat grafting is a safe , effective , and durable treatment for human immunodeficiency virus facial atrophy .",4
The results of this study show that it is not necessary to add plasma rich in growth factors to the adipose tissue graft to get a better result .,4
Eighty patients were enrolled in 2 research centers .,3
Xeomin and DYS presented similar results regarding fields of muscular effects .,3
"However , a larger field of anhidrotic effects was found for DYS .",3
There was a positive correlation between the muscle thickness and electromyography results .,3
The results of this study suggest that a lower dose equivalence between DYS and XEO could be established .,4
"At 3 years , there was no difference in mortality or the combined outcome of death or cardiac hospitalization between those with and without viability , and there was no significant interaction between the type of surgery and the global viability status with respect to mortality or death plus cardiac hospitalization .",3
"Furthermore , there was no difference in mortality or death plus cardiac hospitalization between those with and without anterior wall or apical scar , and no significant interaction between the presence of scar in these regions and the type of surgery with respect to mortality .",3
"In patients with coronary artery disease and severe regional left ventricular dysfunction , assessment of myocardial viability does not identify patients who will derive a mortality benefit from adding surgical ventricular reconstruction to coronary artery bypass graft surgery .",4
"The mean change in uptake at the 1-min massage was 0.97 11.27 % , whereas that at the 1-min control was 11.54 5.59 % ( P < 0.001 ) .",3
"The mean change in uptake at the 2-min massage was also significantly lower than that at the 2-min control ( 11.11 6.97 vs. -0.85 9.78 % , P < 0.001 ) .",3
"However , no statistical difference was observed between the mean changes in uptake after 1 - and 2-min massages ( P = 0.573 ) .",3
"PG massage reduced the radioiodine uptake in the PG , and the effect of PG massage for 1 min was comparable with that of PG massage for 2 min .",4
PG massage can be applied to thyroid cancer patients who receive radioiodine therapy to reduce PG dysfunction .,4
"In older ( > 14 to 17 years ) adolescents , the CAPS intervention was associated with lower GEC ratings at 12 ( = -0.46 ; P = .03 ) and 18 ( = -0.52 ; P = .02 ) months after enrollment .",3
"Trends were also observed for older adolescents toward lower GEC ratings at 6 months ( = -0.40 ; P = .05 ) , lower BRI ratings at 12 ( = -0.40 ; P = .06 ) and 18 ( = -0.47 ; P = .04 ) months , and lower MI ratings at 6 ( = -0.41 ; P = .05 ) , 12 ( = -0.46 ; P = .03 ) , and 18 ( = -0.50 ; P = .03 ) months .",3
"In younger ( 12-14 years ) adolescents , no group differences were found on the GEC , BRI , or MI ratings .",3
Delivery of the CAPS intervention early after TBI in older adolescents improves long-term executive function .,4
"This trial is , to our knowledge , one of the few large , randomized clinical treatment trials performed in pediatric TBI to demonstrate the efficacy of an intervention for management of executive dysfunction and long-term benefits of an intervention delivered soon after injury .",4
"Use of the CAPS intervention clinically should be considered ; however , further research should explore ways to optimize delivery .",4
"The patients treated with filiform needles had more effective pain relief than those in the TI needle group during deep breathing , coughing , and turning over the body ( p < 0.05 ) , and the effect persisted for at least 6 h in most patients .",3
"Sustained maximal inspiration lung volumes and sleep quality did not show improvement through every acupuncture intervention , and they could not respond accurately to pain relief via acupuncture .",3
The active evaluation could provide a more adaptive model for assessing pain intensity due to rib fractures .,4
This novel acupuncture modality in which the needle insertion sites are corresponding to the pain spots can be a safe and viable therapy for relieving pain in inpatients with rib fractures .,4
100 participants completed the study and were included in data analysis .,3
"Two female patients ( one in the taVNS group , one in the sham taVNS group ) dropped out of the study due to stimulation-evoked dizziness .",3
The symptoms were relieved after stopping treatment .,3
"Compared with sham taVNS , taVNS significantly reduced the two-hour glucose tolerance ( F ( 2 ) = 5.79 , p = 0.004 ) .",3
"In addition , we found that taVNS significantly decreased ( F ( 1 ) = 4.21 , p = 0.044 ) systolic blood pressure over time compared with sham taVNS .",3
"Compared with the no-treatment control group , patients receiving taVNS significantly differed in measures of FPG ( F ( 2 ) = 10.62 , p < 0.001 ) , 2hPG F ( 2 ) = 25.18 , p < 0.001 ) and HbAlc ( F ( 1 ) = 12.79 , p = 0.001 ) over the course of the 12week treatment period .",3
"Our study suggests that taVNS is a promising , simple , and cost-effective treatment for IGT / pre-diabetes with only slight risk of mild side-effects .",4
"The biobehavioral intervention in this study merges an efficacious behavioral HIV prevention intervention for women with biomedical prevention through HIV treatment as prevention using a Seek , Test , Treat and Retain strategy .",4
"This combination biobehavioral intervention is designed to ( 1 ) improve the quality of life and reduce HIV infectiousness among women who are HIV positive , and ( 2 ) reduce HIV risk behaviors among women regardless of their HIV status .",4
"If efficacious , this intervention could help control the HIV epidemic in South Africa .",4
"Records from 1,862 older patients were included during the control phase and from 1,411 patients during the intervention phase .",3
"The e-learning course on delirium had a significant positive effect on the risk screening of older patients by nursing staff ( OR 1.8 , p-value < 0.01 ) , as well as on other aspects of delirium care .",3
The number of patients diagnosed with delirium was reduced from 11.2 % in the control phase to 8.7 % in the intervention phase ( p = 0.04 ) .,3
The e-learning course also showed a significant positive effect on nurses ' knowledge of delirium .,3
Nurses who undertook a delirium e-learning course showed a greater adherence to the quality improvement project in delirium care .,4
This improved the recognition of patients at risk and demonstrated that e-learning can be a valuable instrument for hospitals when implementing improvements in delirium care .,4
The findings revealed that many smokers reported using prescribed medications when provided with a supply of cessation medication as determined by an algorithm .,3
"Compared with smokers receiving treatment as usual , PLHIV smokers prescribed these medications reported more quit attempts and greater reduction in smoking .",3
"Proxy measures of cessation readiness ( eg , motivation , self-efficacy ) also favored participants receiving algorithm treatment .",3
This algorithm-derived treatment produced positive changes across a number of important clinical markers associated with smoking cessation .,4
"Given these promising findings coupled with the brief nature of this treatment , the overall pattern of results suggests strong potential for dissemination into clinical settings and significant promise for further advancing clinical health outcomes in this population .",4
There was no statistically significant difference in duration of hospital stay or in the incidence of adverse events .,3
"A significantly higher proportion of adhesion-free patients was found in the treatment group [ 11/23 , 47.8 % ] compared to the control group [ 4/21 , 19 % ] ( P < 0.01 ) .",3
"The mean number of pelvic sites covered by adhesions was significantly lower in the treatment group than in the control group ( 2.20.3 versus 4.60.8 , P < 0.05 ) .",3
"The total adhesion score was significantly lower in the treatment group than in the control group ( 2.10.5 versus 4.81.4 , P < 0.05 ) and the adhesion score was significantly lower at most of the individual anatomical sites .",3
Application of postoperative intraperitoneal wash with lactated Ringer 's solution for 48h may have reasonable safety and efficacy in minimizing postoperative pelvic de novo adhesions following abdominal myomectomy .,4
Response to prior therapy did not influence outcome with second-line axitinib or sorafenib .,3
PFS was significantly longer in axitinib-treated patients who received longer prior cytokine treatment and sorafenib-treated patients with smaller tumour burden following sunitinib .,3
"Overall survival with the second-line therapy was longer in patients who received longer duration of prior therapy , although not significant in the sunitinib-to-axitinib sequence subgroup ; OS was also longer in patients with smaller tumour burden , but not significant in the cytokine-to-axitinib sequence subgroup .",3
Safety profiles differed modestly by type and duration of prior therapy .,3
AXIS data suggest that longer duration of the first-line therapy generally yields better outcome with the second-line therapy and that lack of response to first-line therapy does not preclude positive clinical outcomes with a second-line vascular endothelial growth factor-targeted agent in patients with advanced RCC .,4
"At the 12-week follow-up , 66.5 % ( n = 101 ) of participants engaged in 2.5 h/week of MVPA .",3
"Those with a higher body mass index , more days with poor physical health , a greater number of health conditions , self-reported hypertension , self-reported high cholesterol , and greater pain and stiffness were less likely to engage in 2.5 h of MVPA at the 12-week follow-up ; those with greater arthritis self-efficacy and better performance on the 6 minute walk test were more likely .",3
None of the other factors examined were associated with MVPA .,3
"This study uncovered health-related , arthritis-related , and functional factors associated with MVPA that may help guide intervention strategies .",4
"Participants with less severe symptoms , better functional performance and fewer comorbidities at baseline were more likely to achieve the recommended MVPA level at 12 weeks ; therefore self-directed PA interventions may be best suited for those with relatively good health status despite arthritis , while those with worse symptoms and health status may benefit more from other intervention delivery modalities such as structured , individualized programs where additional support for managing arthritis symptoms and comorbidity can be addressed .",4
"Composite LP declined coherently in the 66 , 70 and 74 Gy external beam dosing groups and was lowest in the high dose rate brachytherapy boost ( HDRB ) group .",3
"At 6.5 years , adjusted cumulative incidences were 22 % , 15 % , 13 % and 7 % respectively .",3
"Compared to 6 months AS , 18 months AS also significantly reduced LP ( p < 0.001 ) .",3
Post-radiation urethral strictures were documented in 45 subjects and increased incrementally in the dosing groups .,3
"Crude incidences were 0.8 % , 0.9 % , 3.8 % and 12.7 % respectively .",3
RDE and increasing AS independently reduce LP and increase urethral strictures .,4
The risks and benefits to the individual must be balanced when selecting radiation dose and AS duration .,4
"Primary outcome was breastfeeding at 5 days , with secondary outcomes of breastfeeding self-efficacy and pain on feeding .",3
Final assessment was at 8 weeks ; 20 also had qualitative interviews .,3
"Researchers assessing outcomes , but not participants , were blinded to group assignment .",3
"107 infants were randomised , 55 to the intervention group and 52 to the comparison group .",3
"Five-day outcome measures were available for 53 ( 96 % ) of the intervention group and 52 ( 100 % ) of the comparison group , and intention-to-treat analysis showed no difference in the primary outcome-Latch , Audible swallowing , nipple Type , Comfort , Hold score .",3
Frenotomy did improve the tongue-tie and increased maternal breastfeeding self-efficacy .,3
"At 5 days , there was a 15.5 % increase in bottle feeding in the comparison group compared with a 7.5 % increase in the intervention group .",3
"After the 5-day clinic , 44 of the comparison group had requested a frenotomy ; by 8 weeks only 6 ( 12 % ) were breastfeeding without a frenotomy .",3
"At 8 weeks , there were no differences between groups in the breastfeeding measures or in the infant weight .",3
No adverse events were observed .,3
Early frenotomy did not result in an objective improvement in breastfeeding but was associated with improved self-efficacy .,4
The majority in the comparison arm opted for the intervention after 5 days .,4
"Mean change in IOP at the 1-month primary outcome time point , as well as all other time points , was not significantly different among groups ( P = 0.99 ) .",3
"Likewise , a repeated-measures , mixed-effects model did not find significant differences in IOP outcome at the 1-month time point ( P = 0.95 ) .",3
"The IOP was reduced in all groups at the 1-month post-SLT time point and all other time points , and no significant differences were found between groups using separate unadjusted cross-sectional analyses of variance ( P > 0.15 for analyses at all time points ) .",3
"Treatment failure rates were not different among groups ( P = 0.75 ) , and at 1 year after SLT , the percentage of patients maintaining a 20 % IOP reduction ranged from 18 % to 22 % in the 3 study groups .",3
Anti-inflammatory therapy after SLT does not seem to substantially influence the IOP-lowering effect of SLT .,4
"In this study of patients with low baseline IOP , SLT showed limited efficacy in achieving a sustained reduction in IOP .",4
"The average time required for placement in groups I and II was 17.56 and 35.08 minutes , respectively ( P = .000 ) .",3
The time required for placement of the IMF wire in group I was 2.1 minutes and in group II was 6 minutes .,3
"The oral hygiene status was assessed , and the mean plaque index score for groups I and II was 1.44 and 2.12 , respectively ( P = .00 ) .",3
The glove perforation rate was much less in group I than in group II .,3
"Finally , the most common complication in both groups was mucosal growth .",3
The results established the supremacy of IMFS compared with eyelet interdental wiring .,4
"Thus , we have concluded that IMFS , in the present scenario , is a safe and time-saving technique .",4
"IMFS is a cost-effective , straightforward , and viable alternative to cumbersome eyelet interdental and other wiring techniques for providing IMF , with satisfactory occlusion during closed reduction or intraoperative open reduction internal fixation of fractures .",4
"In addition , oral hygiene can be maintained , and the glove perforation rate was very low using IMFS .",4
The relatively small sample size and limited follow-up period were the study limitations .,4
"Both the beverage aroma ( P < 0.02 ) and beverage temperature ( P < 0.02 ) had significant and positive effects on performance , which was considerably better with ice-slush than with a neutral temperature beverage , whatever the aroma ( P < 0.002 ) , and with menthol vs non-menthol ( P < 0.02 ) .",3
"The best performances were obtained with ice-slush/menthol and cold/menthol , as opposed to neutral/menthol .",3
No differences were noted in HR and Tco between trials .,3
Cold water or ice-slush with menthol aroma seems to be the most effective beverage for endurance exercise in a tropical climate .,4
Further studies are needed to explore its effects in field competition .,4
The median parasite clearance half-lives ranged from 1.9 hours in the Democratic Republic of Congo to 7.0 hours at the Thailand-Cambodia border .,3
"Slowly clearing infections ( parasite clearance half-life > 5 hours ) , strongly associated with single point mutations in the `` propeller '' region of the P. falciparum kelch protein gene on chromosome 13 ( kelch13 ) , were detected throughout mainland Southeast Asia from southern Vietnam to central Myanmar .",3
"The incidence of pretreatment and post-treatment gametocytemia was higher among patients with slow parasite clearance , suggesting greater potential for transmission .",3
"In western Cambodia , where artemisinin-based combination therapies are failing , the 6-day course of antimalarial therapy was associated with a cure rate of 97.7 % ( 95 % confidence interval , 90.9 to 99.4 ) at 42 days .",3
"Artemisinin resistance to P. falciparum , which is now prevalent across mainland Southeast Asia , is associated with mutations in kelch13 .",4
Prolonged courses of artemisinin-based combination therapies are currently efficacious in areas where standard 3-day treatments are failing .,4

"SMO is as effective as oxazepam , one of the gold standard BDZs , in the treatment of uncomplicated AWS .",4
"Due to its tolerability and absence of significant side effects , SMO may be considered a valid alternative choice in the treatment of AWS .",4
This was a population based randomized control trial .,3
Women aged 20-65 years in the population that matched the inclusion and exclusion criteria were re-called for a repeat smear .,3
"There are four different intervention groups ; letter , registered letters , short messages services ( SMS ) and phone calls where 250 subjects were recruited into each group .",3
Samples were generated randomly from the same population in Klang into four different groups .,3
The first group received a recall letter for a repeat smear similar to the one that has been given during the first invitation .,3
"The intervention groups were either be given a registered letter , an SMS or a phone call to re-call them .",3
The socio-demographic data of the patients who came for uptake were collected for further analysis .,3
All the groups were followed up after 8 weeks to assess their compliance to the recall .,3
The study will provide recommendations about the most effective methods for recall in a population based pap smear screening program on two outcomes : i ) patients response ; ii ) uptake for repeat pap smear .,4
"Eleven mothers ( 5 preterm , 6 near-term ) and 12 infants ( 1 set of twins ) received NAC .",3
"Maternal clearance ( CL ) of NAC was faster than in nonpregnant adults , with a terminal elimination half-life of 1.2 0.2 hours .",3
"The NAC cord to maternal ratio was 1.4 0.8 , suggesting rapid placental transfer and slower rate of fetal CL .",3
"Neonatal PK estimates for near-term compared with preterm infants showed a significantly shorter terminal elimination half-life ( 5.1 vs 7.5 hours , respectively ) and greater CL ( 53.7 vs 45.0 mL/h/kg , respectively ) .",3
"Maternal CL and placental transfer of NAC was rapid , with umbilical cord concentrations frequently exceeding maternal concentrations .",4
"The administration of NAC to mothers with CA achieves predictable NAC plasma concentrations in the fetus , indicating that antenatal neuroprotection may be possible for these newborns at high risk for neuroinflammation .",4
Ranibizumab monotherapy or combined with laser was superior to laser in improving mean average change in BCVA from baseline to months 1 through 12 ( +5.9 and +5.7 vs +1.4 letters ) .,3
"At month 12 , greater proportion of patients gained 15 letters with ranibizumab and ranibizumab + laser compared with laser ( 18.8 % and 17.8 % vs 7.8 % ) .",3
Mean CRST reduced significantly from baseline to month 12 with ranibizumab ( -134.6 m ) and ranibizumab + laser ( -171.8 m ) versus laser ( -57.2 m ) .,3
"Patients received a mean of 7.8 and 7.0 ranibizumab injections in the ranibizumab and ranibizumab + laser arms , respectively , and 1.5-1 .9 active laser across treatment arms over 12 months .",3

"Laser debridement produced an irregular , rough and flaky surface free of carbonization or meltdown while ultrasound produced a relatively smoother surface .",3
The number of exposed dentinal tubules ( n ) followed an energy-dependent trend .,3
The number of exposed tubules among the in vivo laser groups was n 60 mJ = n 100 mJ < n 160 mJ < n 250 mJ ( P < 0.001 ) .,3
Also 160 and 250 mJ lasers led to significantly more dentinal exposure than ultrasound under in vivo condition .,3
"Within the in vitro laser groups , dentinal tubules exposure was n 60 mJ < n 100 mJ < n 160 mJ < n 250 mJ ( P 0.0015 ) .",3
"Furthermore , in vitro laser treatments at 100 , 160 and 250 mJ led to significantly more dentinal denudation than ultrasound .",3
"Treatment duration ( d ) for the in vivo groups was d 60 mJ > d 100 mJ > d Ultrasound = d 160 mJ > d 250 mJ ( P 0.046 ) , while for the in vitro groups it was d 60 mJ > d 100 mJ = d Ultrasound = d 160 mJ > d 250 mJ ( P 0.046 ) .",3
"Due to excessive treatment duration and surface damage , Er : YAG laser debridement at 60 and 250 mJ pulse ( -1 ) , respectively , is not appropriate for clinical use .",4
"Although laser debridement at 100 and 160 mJ pulse ( -1 ) seems more suitable for clinical application , compared to ultrasound the former is more time-consuming and the latter is more aggressive .",4
Using a feedback device or lower pulse energies are recommended when using laser in closed field .,4
The overall incidence of agitation was similar between the 2 groups .,3
"However , when the influence of patient shifting was excluded , the incidence of agitation in the dexmedetomidine group was apparently lower than that in the control group ( 10.3 vs 30 % ; P = .029 ) .",3
No difference was found in the occurrence of delirium between the experimental and control groups ( 5.1 vs 12.5 % ; P = .432 ) .,3
"Dexmedetomidine does not change the overall incidence of agitation after free flap surgery ; however , it does decrease agitation after PACU admission .",4
It does not prevent delirium within 5days postoperatively .,4
The trial investigates potential benefits of non-sedation .,4
This might have large impact on the future treatment of mechanically ventilated critically ill patients .,4

"Among the 384 patients , 152 ( 39.6 % ) developed PONV and were randomized to either the palonosetron ( n = 75 ) or placebo ( n = 77 ) group .",3
"The number of patients with CR at 24 and 72 h was higher in the palonosetron group than the placebo group [ 0-24 h : n = 49 ( 68.1 % ) vs. n = 30 ( 40.5 % ) , p < 0.001 ; 0-72 h : n = 47 ( 65.3 % ) vs. n = 28 ( 37.8 % ) , p < 0.001 ] .",3
"The incidence of PONV at 2 , 24 , and 72 h periods was lower in the palonosetron group than the placebo group ( 29.2 , 45.8 , and 50.0 % in the palonosetron group vs. 50.0 , 62.2 , and 66.2 % in the placebo group , p = 0.010 , 0.048 , 0.047 , respectively ) .",3
The incidence of adverse events was not different between the groups .,3
A single 0.075 mg IV dose of palonosetron effectively increased the CR rates at 24 and 72 h in these moderate-risk patients with established PONV .,4

"In men , the Havrix group showed a significantly higher seroconversion rate ( 81.9 % ) than the Epaxal group ( 69.2 % ) , whereas both vaccine groups showed similarly high immunogenicity in women ( Havrix : 90.1 % , Epaxal : 92.9 % ; P for interaction = 0.062 ) .",3
"According to the results of a multivariate analysis , Epaxal showed significantly lower immunogenicity than Havrix only in men .",3
"Age , obesity , drinking , smoking , and follow-up time did not significantly affect seroconversion in either gender .",3
"The seroconversion rate of single-dose HAV vaccines was low in men , particularly in those who received Epaxal .",4
Our results suggest that gender effects should be considered when comparing the immunogenicity of different HAV vaccines .,4

"In trial I ( 1993-1995 ) , the mortality rate was 0.0 per 1000 person-years among children vaccinated with MV in the presence of maternal antibody and 32.3 per 1000 person-years without maternal antibody ( mortality rate ratio [ MRR ] , 0.0 ; 95 % confidence interval [ CI ] , 0 -.52 ) .",3
"In trial II ( 2003-2007 ) , the mortality rate was 4.2 per 1000 person-years among children vaccinated in presence of maternal measles antibody and 14.5 per 1000 person-years without measles antibody ( MRR , 0.29 ; 95 % CI , .09 -.91 ) .",3
Possible confounding factors did not explain the difference .,3
"In a combined analysis , children who had measles antibody detected when they received their first dose of MV at 4-6 months of age had lower mortality than children with no maternal antibody , the MRR being 0.22 ( 95 % CI , .07 -.64 ) between 4-6 months and 5 years .",3
"Child mortality in low-income countries may be reduced by vaccinating against measles in the presence of maternal antibody , using a 2-dose schedule with the first dose at 4-6 months ( earlier than currently recommended ) and a booster dose at 9-12 months of age .",4
"Ultimately , 147 patients ( 31.2 % ) required a ventriculoperitoneal shunt ( VPS ) in our series .",3
"Age , dissecting aneurysm type , ruptured vertebrobasilar aneurysm , Fisher grade , Hunt and Hess grade , admission intraventricular hemorrhage , admission intraparenchymal hemorrhage , blood in the fourth ventricle on admission , perioperative ventriculostomy , and hemicraniectomy were significant risk factors ( P < .05 ) associated with shunt-dependent hydrocephalus on univariate analysis .",3
"On multivariate analysis , intraventricular hemorrhage and intraparenchymal hemorrhage were independent risk factors for shunt dependency ( P < .05 ) .",3
Clipping vs coiling treatment was not statistically associated with VPS after SAH on both univariate and multivariate analyses .,3
Patients who did not receive a VPS at discharge had higher Glasgow Outcome Scale and Barthel Index scores and were more likely to be functionally independent and to return to work 72 months after surgery ( P < .05 ) .,3
There is no difference in shunt dependency after SAH among patients treated by endovascular or microsurgical means .,4
Patients in whom shunt-dependent hydrocephalus does not develop after SAH tend to have improved long-term functional outcomes .,4
We enrolled 36 women in our study .,3
"When participants were administered escitalopram relative to placebo , left amygdala activity was increased and right inferior frontal gyrus ( IFG ) activity was decreased during presentation of positive pictures ( potentiation of positive emotion processing ) .",3
"In contrast , escitalopram was associated with decreased left amygdala and increased right IFG activity during presentation of negative pictures ( attenuation of negative emotion processing ) .",3
"In addition , escitalopram decreased right IFG activity during the processing of neutral stimuli , akin to the effects on positive stimuli ( decrease in negative appraisal ) .",3
"Although we used a women-only sample to reduce heterogeneity , our results may not generalize to men .",4
"Potential unblinding , which was related to the subjective occurrence of side effects , occurred in the study ; however , manipulation check analyses demonstrated that results were not impacted .",4
These novel findings demonstrate that a single dose of the commonly prescribed escitalopram facilitates a positive information processing bias .,4
These findings provide an important lead for better understanding effects of antidepressant medication .,4
Creatinine kinase-myocardial band ( CK-MB ) isoform elevations occurred less frequently 12 and 24 h after noncardiac emergency surgery in the experimental group than in the control group ( p = 0.029 ) .,3
"After surgery , the incidence of MACCE was also lower in the experimental group than in the control group ( p = 0.019 ) .",3
The difference was mainly due to the incidence of perioperative myocardial infarction ( p = 0.029 ) .,3
Multivariable analysis found that rosuvastatin reload reduced the incidence of MACCE 52 % 6 months after surgery ( p = 0.03 ) .,3
Preoperative rosuvastatin reload therapy decreases the incidence of myocardial necrosis and MACCE after noncardiac emergency surgery in patients with stable coronary artery disease on long-term statin therapy .,4

"The experimental group but not the control group showed linear increases in SMR power over training runs , which was associated with behavioural improvements in memory and attentional performance .",3
"Additionally , increasing SMR led to a more salient stimulus processing as indicated by increased N1 and P3 event-related potential amplitudes after the training as compared to the pre-test .",3
"Finally , functional brain connectivity between motor areas and visual processing areas was reduced after SMR training indicating reduced sensorimotor interference .",3
These results indicate that SMR neurofeedback improves stimulus processing capabilities and consequently leads to improvements in cognitive performance .,4
The present findings contribute to a better understanding of the mechanisms underlying SMR neurofeedback training and cognitive processing and implicate that SMR neurofeedback might be an effective cognitive training tool .,4
"Of 3,195 patients , 157 ( 4.9 % ) completed FOBT and 292 ( 9.1 % ) completed colonoscopy during the study year .",3
"Patients attended 19 clinics , saw 177 physicians , and resided in 332 census tracts .",3
Significant variability was observed across all levels in both hierarchical and cross-classified models that was unexplained by measured covariates .,3
"For colonoscopy , variance was similar across all levels .",3
"For FOBT , physicians , followed by clinics , demonstrated the largest variability .",3
Model fit using cross-classified models was superior or similar to 2-level hierarchical models .,3
"Significant and substantial variability was observed across neighborhood , physician , and clinic levels in CRC test use , suggesting the importance of factors at each of these levels on CRC testing .",4
"Future multilevel research and intervention should consider the simultaneous influences of multiple levels , including clinic , physician , and neighborhood .",4
"Overall prevalence of smoking abstinence was 14.7 % in the intervention and 6.8 % in the control group ( Relative risk : 1.85 , 95 % CI : 1.05 , 3.25 ) .",3
A total of 41.3 % subjects in the intervention area and 13.6 % in the control area had reduced smoking by 50 % or more at the end of 12 months .,3
"Lower number of cigarettes / bidi used , low nicotine dependence and consultation with a doctor for a medical ailment were the statistically significant predictors for smoking cessation .",3
Rigorous approaches for smoking cessation programmes can enhance quit rates in smoking in rural areas of India .,4
"A total of 457 patients were randomised ( 238 tiotropium , 219 placebo ; mean age 62 years ; FEV1 1.93 l ( 66 % predicted ) ) .",3
"Tiotropium was superior to placebo in mean change from baseline in post-dose FEV1 area under the curve from 0 to 3h ( AUC0-3h ) at week 24 ( primary endpoint ) : 0.19 vs. -0.03 l ( least-squares mean difference 0.23 l , P < 0.001 ) .",3
"FVC AUC0-3h , trough and peak FEV1 and FVC were significantly improved with tiotropium versus placebo ( P < 0.001 ) .",3
"Compared with placebo , tiotropium provided numerical improvements in physical activity ( P = NS ) .",3
Physician 's Global Assessment ( health status ) improved ( P = 0.045 ) with less impairment on the Work Productivity and Activity Impairment questionnaire ( P = 0.043 ) at week 24 .,3
"The incidence of exacerbations , cough , bronchitis and dyspnoea was lower with tiotropium than placebo .",3

"Similar results were obtained between groups for all the parameters compared : fertilization rates of 75.3 % ( 95 % confidence interval [ CI ] , 71.6-78 .9 ) versus 72.1 % ( 95 % CI , 68.6-75 .7 ) ; percentage of good-quality embryos on day 2 of 53.7 % ( 95 % CI , 50.3-57 .1 ) versus 51.8 % ( 95 % CI , 48.3-55 .3 ) and on day 3 of 54.2 % ( 95 % CI , 50.7-57 .6 ) versus 48.9 % ( 95 % CI , 45.3-52 .4 ) ; implantation rates of 42.2 % ( 95 % CI , 33.8-48 .1 ) versus 40.1 % ( 95 % CI , 34.8-49 .6 ) ; positive beta-hCG tests of 63.2 % ( 95 % CI , 54.7-71 .6 ) versus 68.6 % ( 95 % CI , 60.2-76 .9 ) , and live-birth rates of 48.4 % ( 95 % CI , 39.6-57 .1 ) versus 56.4 % ( 95 % CI , 47.3-65 .5 ) in the MACS versus control group .",3
None of the differences reached statistical significance .,3
Applying MACS technology to remove AV + sperm cells from unselected males does not improve the reproductive outcome of ICSI in OD .,4
"At 500 and 1500 Hz , almost all threshold differences ( conventional PTA minus in-situ data ) were negative , i.e. , in the low to mid frequencies , hearing loss was overestimated by most devices relative to PTA .",3
"At 4000 Hz , the majority of differences ( 7 of 12 ) were positive , i.e. , in the frequency range above 1500 Hz , hearing loss was frequently underestimated .",3
"As hearing loss increased ( MMSS ) , the effect of the underestimation decreased .",3
"At 500 and 1500 Hz , Resound devices showed the smallest threshold deviations , followed by Phonak , Starkey , and Oticon instruments .",3
"At 4000 Hz , this observed pattern partly disappeared and Starkey and Oticon devices showed a reversed effect with increasing hearing loss ( MMSS ) .",3
"Because of high standard errors for the estimates , only a few explicit rankings of the devices could be established based on significant threshold differences ( 5 % level ) .",3
"Differences between conventional PTA and in-situ threshold levels may be attributed to ( 1 ) frequency , ( 2 ) device/hearing loss , and ( 3 ) calibration/manufacturer effects .",4
Frequency effects primarily resulting in an overestimation of hearing loss by in-situ audiometry in the low and mid frequencies are mainly due to sound drain-off through vents and leaks .,4
Device/hearing loss effects may be due to leakage as well as boundary effects because in-situ audiometry is confined to a limited measurement range .,4
"Finally , different calibration approaches may result in different offset levels between PTA and in-situ audiometry calibration .",4
"In some cases , the observed threshold differences of up to 10-15 dB may translate to varied hearing aid fittings for the same user depending on how hearing threshold levels were measured .",4
We included 58 participants .,3
"Adherence was high across all measures ( 89.3 % self-report , 96.7 % tablet counts , and 89.2 % medication event monitoring system ) .",3
Agreement between the measures was poor at times .,3
"Adherence according to the medication event monitoring system best distinguished between the participants who relapsed ( 71.4 % ) and those who remained in remission ( 93.4 % ) , although this difference was not statistically discernible at the 5 % level .",3
"Adherence deteriorated over the study period , with three times daily participants generally less adherent than once-daily participants ( odds ratio , 0.03 ; 95 % confidence interval , 0.01-0 .08 ) .",3
"Adherence was higher on weekdays ( odds ratio , 1.47 ; 95 % confidence interval , 1.31-1 .65 ) and around clinic visit dates ( odds ratio , 1.43 ; 95 % confidence interval , 1.18-1 .72 ) .",3
Simple dosing regimens are preferable to multiple daily dosing regimens .,4
Electronic monitoring of adherence should be used more often in clinical studies .,4
Self-reported adherence and tablet counts may underestimate adherence .,4
"Adherence declined over time , and adherence was generally lower and more varied for those allocated to the three times daily regimen .",4
"Between Nov 19 , 2008 , and June 12 , 2012 , 321 patients were randomly assigned to fluorouracil and leucovorin ( n = 161 ) and FOLFOX ( n = 160 ) .",3
141 ( 95 % ) of 149 patients in the fluorouracil plus leucovorin group and 141 ( 97 % ) of 146 in the FOLFOX group completed all planned cycles of adjuvant treatment .,3
Median follow-up was 382 months ( IQR 264-506 ) .,3
"3-year disease-free survival was 716 % ( 95 % CI 646-786 ) in the FOLFOX group and 629 % ( 554-704 ) in the fluorouracil plus leucovorin group ( hazard ratio 0657 , 95 % CI 0434-0994 ; p = 0047 ) .",3
"Any grade neutropenia , thrombocytopenia , fatigue , nausea , and sensory neuropathy were significantly more common in the FOLFOX group than in the fluorouracil plus leucovorin group ; however , we noted no significant difference in the frequency of these events at grade 3 or 4 .",3
"The most common grade 3 or worse adverse events were neutropenia ( 38 [ 26 % ] of 149 patients in the fluorouracil plus leucovorin group vs 52 [ 36 % ] of 146 patients in the FOLFOX group ) , leucopenia ( eight [ 5 % ] vs 12 [ 8 % ] ) , febrile neutropenia ( four [ 3 % ] vs one [ < 1 % ] ) , diarrhoea ( four [ 3 % ] vs two [ 1 % ] ) , and nausea ( one [ < 1 % ] vs two [ 1 % ] ) .",3
"Adjuvant FOLFOX improves disease-free survival compared with fluorouracil plus leucovorin in patients with locally advanced rectal cancer after preoperative chemoradiotherapy and total mesorectal excision , and warrants further investigation .",4
The average time until healing was 39.76 18.22 days in the PACK-CXL group and 46.05 27.44 days in the control group ( P = 0.68 ) .,3
"After treatment and healing , corrected distance visual acuity was 1.64 0.62 in the PACK-CXL group and 1.67 0.48 in the control group ( P = 0.68 ) .",3
The corneal ulceration 's width and length was significantly bigger in the PACK-CXL group ( P = 0.004 and P = 0.007 ) .,3
Three patients in the control group demonstrated corneal perforation ; infection recurred in 1 of them .,3
No serious complications occurred in the PACK-CXL group .,3
"Corneal CXL with photoactivated riboflavin did not shorten the time to corneal healing ; however , the complication rate was 21 % in the control group , whereas there was no incidence of corneal perforation or recurrence of the infection in the PACK-CXL group .",4
These results indicate that PACK-CXL may be an effective adjuvant therapy in the management of severe infectious keratitis associated with corneal melting .,4
Resection without macroscopical residual ( R0/R1 ) was achieved in 149 of 150 patients in each group .,3
"Although there was no significant difference between the 2 groups regarding the incidence of each single complication , a significantly higher morbidity rate was found in the Sweet group ( 62 of 150 [ 41.3 % ] ) than in the Ivor-Lewis group ( 45 of 150 [ 30 % ] ) ( P = .04 ) .",3
More patients in the Sweet group ( 8 of 150 [ 5.3 % ] ) received reoperations than in the Ivor-Lewis group ( 1 of 150 [ 0.7 % ] ) ( P = .04 ) .,3
The median hospital stay was 18 days in the Sweet group vs 16 days in the Ivor-Lewis group ( P = .002 ) .,3
"Postoperative mortality rates in the Ivor-Lewis ( 1 of 150 ) and Sweet ( 3 of 150 ) groups were 0.7 % and 2.0 % , respectively ( P = .25 ) .",3
"More lymph nodes were removed during Ivor-Lewis esophagectomy than during the Sweet procedure ( 22 vs 18 , P < .001 ) .",3
Early results of this study demonstrate that the Ivor-Lewis procedure can be performed with lower rates of postoperative complications and more lymph node retrieval .,4
Ivor-Lewis and Sweet esophagectomies are both safe procedures with low operative mortalities .,4
"The hypotensive and standard groups appeared similar , with no statistically significant differences in mean age ( 46.5 months versus 46.5 months ) , weight ( 19.25 kg versus 19.49 kg ) , procedure [ anterior remodeling ( 34 versus 31 ) versus posterior ( 19 versus 16 ) ] , or preoperative hemoglobin level ( 13 g/dl versus 12.9 g/dl ) .",3
Intraoperative mean arterial pressures differed significantly ( 56 mm Hg versus 66 mm Hg ; p < 0.001 ) .,3
"The captured cell saver amount was lower in the hypotensive group ( 163 cc versus 204 cc ; p = 0.02 ) , yet no significant differences were noted in postoperative hemoglobin levels ( 8.8 g/dl versus 9.3 g/dl ) .",3
"Fifteen of 100 patients ( 15 percent ) received allogenic transfusions , but no statistically significant differences were noted in transfusion rates between the hypotensive [ nine of 53 ( 17.0 percent ) ] and standard anesthesia [ six of 47 ( 13 percent ) ] group ( p = 0.056 ) .",3
No significant difference in transfusion requirements was found between hypotensive and standard anesthesia during craniosynostosis corrections .,4
"Considering potential benefits of improved cerebral blood flow and total body perfusion , surgeons might consider performing craniosynostosis corrections without hypotension .",4
Beta ERS of foot MI in patients with lower limb amputations was significantly lesser than that in healthy subjects .,3
"Compared with sham stimulation , cathodal tDCS enhanced beta ERS of foot MI in patients with lower limb amputations .",3
"In contrast , anodal tDCS decreased beta ERS of foot MI in healthy subjects .",3
This is the first study to demonstrate that cathodal tDCS can enhance a weak beta ERS of foot MI in patients with lower limb amputations .,4
These findings might contribute in improving the effectiveness of sensorimotor rhythm-based brain computer interface for gait restoration after lower limb amputation .,4
Twenty-one patients met all inclusion and exclusion criteria .,3
Twelve were randomized to the control group and nine to the dorzolamide-timolol group .,3
"In the dorzolamide-timolol group , mean intraocular pressure was 17.4 on postoperative Day 1 and 12.5 on postoperative Week 1 ( P = 0.03 ) .",3
"In the control group , mean intraocular pressure was 14.5 on postoperative Day 1 and 15.1 on postoperative Week 1 ( P = 0.73 ) .",3
The mean duration of C3F8 was 37.8 days in the dorzolamide-timolol group and 40.4 days in the control group ( P = 0.70 ) .,3
Topical aqueous suppression does not seem to have a significant effect on the duration of pure expansile intraocular C3F8 in nonvitrectomized eyes after pneumatic retinopexy or scleral buckling .,4
PIK3CA mutations ( both exon 9 and exon 20 ) were associated with low tumor grade .,3
An enrichment of PIK3CA exon 20 mutations was observed in progesterone receptor - positive tumors .,3
PIK3CA exon 20 mutations were not associated with downstream-activated proteins .,3
No significant interaction between PIK3CA mutations or any of the other canonic pathway drivers and tamoxifen-treatment benefit was found .,3
"PIK3CA mutations do not have clinical validity to predict intrinsic resistance to adjuvant tamoxifen and may therefore be unsuitable as companion diagnostic for PI3K/AKT/mTOR inhibitors in ER - positive , postmenopausal , early breast cancer patients .",4
"In patients receiving selumetinib + docetaxel and harbouring KRAS G12C or G12V mutations there were trends towards greater improvement in OS , PFS and ORR compared with other KRAS mutations .",3
Different KRAS mutations in NSCLC may influence selumetinib/docetaxel sensitivity .,4
"Painless insertion was reported by 30.0 % ( AI ) , 43.3 % ( WI ) , and 61.1 % ( WE ) of patients ( P < 0.001 ) .",3
"Multivariate logistic regression analysis revealed that , after adjusting for gender , body mass index , abdominal compression , position change , insertion time to cecum , and length of scope at cecum , only WE was significantly associated with painless insertion compared with AI ( odds ratio ( OR ) = 0.08 , 95 % confidence interval ( CI ) = 0.03-0 .24 , P < 0.001 ) or WI ( OR = 0.14 , 95 % CI = 0.05-0 .40 , P < 0.001 ) .",3
"Adenoma detection rate ( ADR ) in the right ( cecum and ascending ) colon was 11.1 % ( AI ) , 14.4 % ( WI ) , and 26.7 % ( WE ) ( P = 0.015 ) .",3
The limitations included single site study with unblinded colonoscopist and assistant .,3
"This head-to-head comparison of AI vs. WI vs. WE confirmed that WE was superior to WI and AI , with a significantly greater proportion of patients reporting painless insertion .",4
The significantly higher ADR in the right colon in the WE group warrants further investigations .,4
"Of the 60 included patients , 46 completed the 12-month follow-up period .",3
"Six underwent transplantation , five died and three were transferred to hemodialysis ( HD ) .",3
"The treatment was well tolerated , with no side effects nor abandonments due to such effects .",3
"Throughout the study period , six patients ( 20 % ) undergoing traditional care and only two ( 6,7 % ) receiving polyhexanide developed an exit-site infection ( p = 0.032 ) .",3
There were a total number of 12 infections ; nine occurred in patients following the traditional approach and only three in patients treated with polyhexanide ( p = 0.037 ) .,3
"The germs responsible for the infections were : S. aureus ( six cases ) , Corynebacterium jeikeium ( two cases ) and P. aeruginosa ( one case ) in the saline serum and povidone-iodine group and P. aeruginosa ( three cases ) in the polyhexanide group .",3
The mean rate of exit-site infection was 1 episode/36 .6 patient-months for the traditional care group and 1 episode/102 .7 patient-months for the polyhexanide group ( p = 0.017 ) .,3
Patients following the traditional treatment required fewer days to get infected than those using polyhexanide ( p = 0.033 ; log rank : 4.2 ) .,3
These results show that using polyhexanide is efficient for the prevention of exit-site infections .,4
Patients treated with this product suffer from fewer infections and need more time to become infected .,4
"Polyhexanide application is painless , no allergies have been described and it is well tolerated by patients .",4
We therefore propose that it may be used routinely from now on for the care of healthy exit site .,4
"On day 3 after contrast exposure , four and seven patients in the periprocedural and simultaneous groups , respectively experienced CIN ( 17.4 % versus 15.6 % , p = 0.846 ) .",3
"On days 5-30 , seven and three patients in the periprocedural and simultaneous groups , respectively experienced CIN ( 30.4 % versus 6.7 % , p = 0.009 ) .",3
The serum creatinine levels of patients in the periprocedural group transiently decreased on day 1 and persistently increased during days 5-30 compared with the simultaneous group .,3
"This difference between the two groups in terms of creatinine levels over time was statistically significant ( F statistic = 6.830 ; p = 0.001 , by ANCOVA ) .",3
"The cost of hemofiltration was doubled in the periprocedural group ( $ 106683 versus $ 50440 , p < 0.001 ) .",3
Simultaneous hemofiltration provide equal early ( day 3 ) and better late-stage ( days 5-30 ) renal protection against CIN at a significantly lower cost compared with periprocedural hemofiltration .,4
"Electromagnetic tracking significantly decreased the number of scans , effective radiation dose , number of manipulations per procedure , and time from skin-stick to the target lesion .",3
"The ratio of the number of scans ( electromagnetic tracking to control ) was 0.55 ( 95 % CI , 0.42-0 .73 ; p < 0.0001 ) .",3
"The mean difference in effective radiation dose ( electromagnetic tracking-control ) was -4.7 mSv ( 95 % CI , -7.01 to -2.44 mSv ; p = 0.0001 ) , and the median difference was -5.1 mSv ( 95 % CI , -7.01 to -3.56 mSv ; p < 0.0001 ) .",3
"The ratio of the number of manipulations ( electromagnetic tracking to control ) was 0.36 ( 95 % CI , 0.24-0 .54 ; p < 0.0001 ) .",3
"The mean difference for the time from skin-stick to the target lesion was -247.6 seconds ( 95 % CI , -394.34 to -100.83 seconds ; p = 0.0014 ) and the median difference was -253.0 seconds ( 95 % CI , -325.00 to -124.00 seconds ; p = 0.0001 ) .",3
Electromagnetic tracking assistance has the potential to decrease the number of intraprocedural CT scans and needle manipulations and to reduce patient radiation dose during CT-guided liver biopsy .,4
"Either or both enzymes were above the upper limit of normal in 22.7 % of subjects ; 16.6 % ( n = 1540 ) had an elevated lipase level ( including 1.2 % > 3-fold elevated ) , and 11.8 % ( n = 1094 ) had an elevated amylase level ( including 0.2 % > 3-fold elevated ) .",3
"In multivariable regression models , severely reduced kidney function was associated with the largest effect on increasing activity of both .",3
"However , even among subjects with normal kidney function , 12.2 % and 7.7 % had elevated lipase and amylase levels .",3
"In this large study of type 2 diabetic patients , nearly 25 % had elevated lipase or amylase levels without symptoms of acute pancreatitis .",4
The clinician must take these data into account when evaluating abdominal symptoms in type 2 diabetic patients .,4
"Overall , 14 patients received suplatast , and 13 received mequitazine for 8 weeks from September through early October .",3
"During follow-up , the number of days without symptoms and the total JPAC scores did not differ significantly between the groups .",3
"However , as compared with weeks 1 to 2 of treatment , the mean number of days without symptoms during weeks 7 to 8 increased significantly in only the suplatast group ( 8.6 vs. 11.5 days ; p = 0.004 ) .",3
"Our results suggest that short-term additional treatment with suplatast is useful for preventing asthma symptoms in children with asthma , which is usually exacerbated in the autumn .",4
The two groups did not statistically differ at baseline characteristics .,3
"In Group 1 tibolone treatment decreased significantly TC ( p = 0.01 ) , HDL ( p < 0.001 ) , and Tg ( p < 0.001 ) serum levels while a significant increase ofhsCRP ( p < 0.001 ) was observed .",3
"Finally no changes were noticed on LDL , Hcy , and ET-1 serum levels .",3
"Regarding Group 2 , no changes were observed .",3
"Short-term tibolone treatment in healthy postmenopausal women exerts a mixed action , acting beneficially in some markers ( TC , LDL , Tg , Hcy , and ET-1 ) where as detrimentally in others ( HDL , hsCRP ) .",4
"A mixed ANCOVA demonstrated that baseline ( p = 0.02 ) and change in family instrumental support ( p = 0.01 ) , but not emotional support from family or peers , predicted increases in MVPA across a 19-week period .",3
Future interventions in underserved adolescents should enhance opportunities for instrumental support for PA. .,4
"The incidence of hypotension ( 16 versus 7 , p = 0.0035 ) and the required dose of ephedrine [ 24 ( 0-40 ) versus 0 ( 0-20 ) , p < 0.0001 ] were greater in group L compared to group HE .",3
"In group L , the time to achieve maximal sensory block level ( MSBL ) was shorter ( 11.85.4 min versus 20.16.3 min , p < 0.0001 ) and MSBL was also higher than in group HE [ 14 ( T2 ) versus 12 ( T4 ) , p = 0.0015 ] .",3
"Head elevation during CSE and Caesarean section is superior to positioning without head elevation in the lateral to supine position , as it is associated with a more gradual onset , appropriate block height , and improved hemodynamics .",4
One hundred ninety patients completed the study .,3
Systolic BP ( 144.47.4 vs 145.96.4 mm Hg ) and diastolic BP ( 85.56.9 vs. 85.17.7 mm Hg ) were similar between groups at baseline .,3
The trend of BP was not significantly different between groups during the study period .,3
Systolic and diastolic BP decreased significantly in both groups at the first follow-up visit ( systolic BP : 132.6 vs. 133.4 mm Hg ; diastolic BP : 77.4 vs. 77.2 mm Hg ) .,3
"In the intervention group , we observed a small continued decrease in diastolic BP up to week 24 BP ( P = 0.01 ) .",3
Both groups showed adherence rates > 95 % during the study period .,3
Our study could not confirm that self-monitoring can improve BP control in patients with frequent medical visits .,4
"When tumors were stratified into high and low EGFR expression groups ( IHC score threshold 200 ; scale 0-300 ) , a stronger antitumor activity was seen in the high EGFR expression group compared with the low EGFR expression group in both the cetuximab monotherapy and cisplatin plus cetuximab combination therapy settings .",3
"For tumors treated with cisplatin plus cetuximab , the objective response rate was significantly higher in the high EGFR expression group compared with the low EGFR expression group ( 68 % vs. 29 % ) .",3
"Objective response rates were similar in high and low expression groups for tumors treated with cisplatin alone ( 27 % vs. 24 % , respectively ) .",3
"Cetuximab activity in NSCLC patient-derived xenograft models was demonstrated clearly only in tumors that expressed high levels of EGFR , as defined by an IHC score of 200 .",4
There was a `` moderate '' degree of inter-rater agreement amongst panel members in all categories .,3
Greater agreement occurred using video footage to assess overall cosmesis ( 0.548 vs 0.507 ) and shape ( 0.505 vs 0.486 ) .,3
Video showed a greater degree of correlation with patient self-assessment scores in comparison to photography ( 0.311 vs 0.281 ) .,3
Video footage coupled with panel assessment is a valid method of assessing post-operative outcomes of breast reconstruction and appears superior to still photographs in terms of inter-rater agreement and correlation with patient self-assessment .,4
Antioxidant supplementation reduced malondialdehyde level ( P < 0.001 ) and raised total antioxidant capacity ( P < 0.001 ) and glutathione ( P < 0.01 ) .,3
The serum 8-hydroxydeoxyguanosine remained unchanged ( P < 0.4 ) .,3
"After adjusting for the covariates effects , MMSE scores following 6 - ( 25.88 0.17 ) and 12-month antioxidant supplementation ( 26.8 0.17 ) did not differ from control group ( 25.86 0.18 and 26.59 0.18 , respectively ) .",3
"Despite significant improvement in most of the oxidative stress biomarkers , antioxidants ' supplementation was not observed to enhance cognitive performance .",4
A large number of kinetic and/or dynamic factors could be suspected .,4
There was a statistically significant difference in the use of postoperative elastics ( P < .0001 ) .,3
"There was no statistically significant difference in other outcome measurements , including clinical evidence of relapse .",3
Resorbable screws can be used effectively for fixation of BSSO for mandibular advancement .,4
A higher incidence of rotation around positional screws can result secondary to the mechanical `` looseness '' when using resorbable screws .,4
This can be treated effectively using Class III mechanic elastics during the initial stages of bone healing .,4
"In the 110/233 analyzed patients ( 47.2 % ) with low initial procalcitonin ( < 0.25 g/L ) , suggesting the absence of systemic bacterial infection , those randomized to procalcitonin guidance ( n = 50 ) had a significantly lower adverse outcome rate compared to controls ( n = 60 ) : 4 % vs. 20 % ( absolute difference -16.0 % , 95 % confidence interval ( CI ) -28.4 % to -3.6 % , P = 0.01 ) , and significantly reduced antibiotic exposure [ days ] ( mean 3.7 4.0 vs. 6.5 4.4 , difference -2.8 [ 95 % CI , -4.4 to -1.2 ] , P < 0.01 ) .",3
"When initial procalcitonin was 0.25 g/L , procalcitonin-guided patients had significantly reduced antibiotic exposure due to early stop of therapy without any difference in adverse outcomes ( 25.8 % vs. 24.6 % , difference [ 95 % CI ] 1.2 % [ -14.5 % to 16.9 % , P = 0.88 ] ) .",3
CHF patients presenting to the emergency department with respiratory symptoms and suspicion for respiratory infection had decreased antibiotic exposure and improved outcomes when procalcitonin measurement was used to exclude bacterial infection and guide antibiotic treatment .,4
These data provide further evidence for the potential harmful effects of antibiotic / fluid treatment when used instead of diuretics and heart failure medication in clinically symptomatic CHF patients without underlying infection .,4
"Most ( 80 % , ( 70 % , 100 % ) [ median ( IQR ) ] ) of the assigned curriculum was received by Fit4Life participants as compared to 50 % ( 40 % , 65 % ) among controls .",3
Fit4Life recipients 14 years demonstrated less weight gain ( P = 0.05 ) and increased moderate-to-vigorous physical activity ( P < 0.01 ) while all Fit4Life recipients reported reduced negative mood ( P < 0.05 ) over time as compared to control counterparts .,3
We demonstrated acceptable feasibility of a WMI tailored for overweight and obese children surviving ALL utilizing a multimodal technology approach .,4
"Improved weight , weight-related behavior , and psychological outcomes were demonstrated among Fit4Life intervention as compared to youth receiving a generic WMI .",4
Data from this pilot trial may be used to design a larger trial to determine whether youth of all ages also can derive a benefit from a cancer survivor-tailored WMI and whether short-term outcomes translate into improved long-term outcomes for childhood ALL survivors .,4
There were no significant differences between the intervention and control groups on either A1c or systolic BP following the intervention .,3
The addition of technology alone is unlikely to lead to improvements in outcomes .,4
"Practices need to be selective in their use of telemonitoring with patients , limiting it to patients who have motivation or a significant change in care , such as starting insulin .",4
Attention to the need for effective and responsive clinic processes to optimize the use of the additional data is also important when implementing these types of technology .,4
"In both groups there is a significant improvement over time in the Symptom Checklist ( SCL-90 ) , the Rating of Health Locus of Control Attributions , the Fear Avoidance Beliefs Questionnaire ( FABQS ) and a Visual Analogue Pain Scale ( VAS-pain ) .",3
"There are significant interactions between treatment group and VAS-pain and the FABQS , showing a superior improvement in the intervention group , while no significant superiority is found for the SCL .",3
The experience of pain can be altered directly and not only through improvement of depression or general somatoform complaints .,4
The study replicates other research and increases the evidence base for this mode of treatment .,4
The treatment effect can be called specific as it is found additional to a multimodal inpatient care programme .,4
"The adjusted hazard ratios ( HRs ) for association of progression to cataract surgery at 5 years were : nuclear cataract increase of 1.0 unit or more compared with less than 1.0-unit change at 2 years , 2.77 ( 95 % confidence interval [ CI ] , 2.07-3 .70 ; P < 0.001 ) ; cortical cataract increase of 5 % or more in lens opacity in the central 5 mm of the lens compared with less than 5 % increase at 2 years , 1.91 ( 95 % CI , 1.27-2 .87 ; P = 0.002 ) ; and posterior subcapsular cataract increase of 5 % or more versus less than 5 % in the central 5 mm of the lens , 8.25 ( 95 % CI , 5.55-12 .29 ; P < 0.001 ) .",3
"Similarly , HRs of vision loss of 2 lines or more at 5 years for this degree of lens changes at 2 years were the following : nuclear , 1.83 ( 95 % CI , 1.49-2 .25 ; P < 0.001 ) ; cortical , 1.13 ( 95 % CI , 0.78-1 .65 ; P = 0.519 ) ; and posterior subcapsular cataract , 3.05 ( 95 % CI , 1.79-5 .19 ; P < 0.001 ) .",3
"Two-year changes in severity of lens opacities on the AREDS lens grading scale are predictive of long-term clinically relevant outcomes , making them potential surrogate end points in follow-up studies .",4
"The mean portal pressure declined significantly in both groups , from 16 mmHg ( range , 12-28 mmHg ) to 13.5 mmHg ( range , 6-20 mmHg ) in the combination group ( P < 0.05 ) , and from 17 mmHg ( range , 12-27 mmHg ) to 14 mmHg ( range , 7-25 mmHg ) in the propranolol monotherapy group ( P < 0.05 ) .",3
"However , the medication-induced pressure reduction did not differ significantly between the two groups [ 3.5 mmHg ( range , -3 -11 mmHg ) vs. 3 mmHg ( range , -8 -10 mmHg ) , P = 0.674 ] .",3
"The response rate ( 55.6 % vs. 61.5 % , P = 0.435 ) and the reductions in mean blood pressure or heart rate also did not differ significantly between the combination and monotherapy groups .",3
"The addition of candesartan ( an ARB ) to propranolol confers no benefit relative to classical propranolol monotherapy for the treatment of portal hypertension , and is thus not recommended .",4
"This study will provide evidence about the effectiveness of home-collection combined with SMS reminders on chlamydia retesting , repeat infection and reinfection rates in three risk groups .",4
The trial will determine client acceptability and cost effectiveness of this strategy .,4
"In a randomized , controlled crossover trial , ten healthy volunteers consumed ( a ) blueberry-containing baked products , ( b ) an unprocessed blueberry drink containing the same amount of freeze-dried blueberry powder as used in the baked products , and ( c ) matched control baked products .",3
"Endothelial function was measured as flow-mediated dilation ( FMD ) and plasma samples taken at baseline and at 1 , 2 , 4 , and 6 h postconsumption .",3
"Although processing did not significantly change the total ( poly ) phenolic amount , the processed products contained significantly less anthocyanins ( -42 % ) , more chlorogenic acid ( 23 % ) , no flavanol nonamers or decamers , and significantly more flavanol dimers and trimers ( 36 % and 28 % , respectively ) .",3
"FMD increased after 1 , 2 , and 6 h consumption of the baked products to a similar degree as the unprocessed blueberries , despite significant differences in the levels of individual plasma metabolites .",3
No changes were observed after the consumption of the control product .,3
Careful processing can preserve important biological activities of blueberries despite changing the blueberry ( poly ) phenol composition and plasma metabolite profile .,4
"No significant arrhythmia or abnormal blood pressure responses occurred during either session , and no muscle soreness was reported within 48 hrs posttest .",3
"The authors found a difference between W40 and W70 sessions for mean ( standard deviation ) ventilation ( 25.1 % [ 8 % ] and 32.1 % [ 9 % ] of maximal ventilation , respectively ; P = 0.04 ) and a small difference for mean ( standard deviation ) heart rate ( 73 [ 7 ] and 79 [ 8 ] beats/min , respectively ; P < 0.01 ) .",3
"When compared with the W40 , the W70 was associated with higher active energy expenditure ( 2.4 [ 0.6 ] and 3.1 [ 0.9 ] Kcal/min , respectively ; P < 0.0001 ) and a similar mean ( standard deviation ) oxygen uptake ( 5.5 [ 1 ] and 6.6 [ 1 ] ml/min per kilogram , respectively ; P = 0.07 ) .",3
"The qualitative percentages of carbohydrates and lipids oxidized were 71 % and 29 % , respectively , at W40 and 91 % and 9 % , respectively , at W70 .",3
"Both protocols , which consisted of repeating 6-sec phases of contractions with 10 secs of passive recovery on the Huber Motion Lab , seemed to be well tolerated , safe , and feasible in this group of coronary heart disease patients .",4
"The A type endometrial proportion on hCG day and high-quality embryo rate in the observation group were higher than those in the control group , indicating the significant differences ( both P < 0.05 ) .",3
The difference in endometrial thickness on hCG day was not significant between the two groups ( P > 0.05 ) .,3
"In the observation group , endometrial hemodynamic index ( peak systolic blood velocity/end-diastolic blood velocity , S/D ) , resistive index ( RI ) and pulse index ( PI ) were lower than those in the control group ( P < 0.01 , P < 0.05 ) .",3
The levels of serum E2 and P on hCG day in the observation group were higher than those in the control group ( both P < 0.05 ) .,3
"The differences were not significant in Gn dose , Gn medication time , numbers of follicles > 1.6 cm on hCG day , oocyte count , embryo cultivation rate and clinical pregnancy rate and LH level on hCG day between the two groups ( all P > 0.05 ) .",3
"In IVF-ET treatment , acupuncture and moxibustion affect estrogen level on hCG day , improve high-quality embryo rate , endometrial blood flow state and morphology so that the endometrial receptivity is increased and the method is expected to be the assistant therapeutic approach for the improvement of IVF-ET outcome .",4
"Subjects in the control and intervention groups showed improvement in their oral health assessments , swallowing abilities and oral intake .",3
There were no significant differences between the two groups .,3
"Although not statistically significant , overall prevalence of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus colonization in the control group almost doubled ( from 4.8 % to 9.5 % ) , while colonization in the intervention group decreased ( from 20.8 % to 16.7 % ) .",3
These findings demonstrate the importance of oral care in the poststroke patient with dysphagia .,4
"The first hypothesized structural equation model demonstrated a good fit and indicated that more maternal depressive symptoms were directly associated with less parental monitoring and more conflict , which in turn each were associated with poorer adherence and glycemic control .",3
"Although higher involvement expectancies were associated with more monitoring and less conflict , they were not associated with other model variables .",3
A second alternative model also fit the data well ; poorer youth adherence was associated with more conflict that in turn related to maternal depressive symptoms .,3
Two models were tested by which maternal depressive symptoms and poorer youth adherence were interrelated via less monitoring and more conflict .,4
Follow-up longitudinal evaluation can best characterize the full extent of these relations .,4
Analysis of the results showed a significant improvement of the BODE index in the experimental group while in the control group this ratio changed slightly .,3
The FEV1 and MRC parameters changed significantly only in the experimental group .,3
"After a week of therapy the BODE index improved in both groups , but in the experimental group there was a significantly higher difference .",4
"In the experimental group all BODE components except BMI improved highly significantly , whereas in the control group only exercise capacity was significantly improved .",4
"At 12-month follow-up , 59 ( 83 % ) and 55 ( 85 % ) in press-fit and screw group , respectively had good-to-excellent IKDC score ( p > 0.05 ) .",3
"The mean laxity assessed using a KT-1000 arthrometer improved to 2.7 and 2.5 mm in press-fit and screw group , respectively .",3
"Regarding Lachman and pivot shift test , there was a statistically significant improvement in the integrity of the ACL in both the groups , but no significant differences was noted between groups .",3
"There were no significant differences in terms of femur circumference difference , effusion , knee range of motion , pain and complications .",3
The press-fit technique is an efficient procedure .,4
Its outcome was comparable with the interference screw group .,4
"Furthermore it has unlimited bone-to-bone healing , no need for removal of hardware , ease for revision and cost effectiveness .",4
"Between Dec 7 , 2011 , and March 15 , 2013 , 320 patients were randomly assigned to the control group ( n = 160 ) and point-of-care ultrasonography group ( n = 160 ) .",3
158 patients in the point-of-care ultrasonography group and 157 in the control group were analysed .,3
"4 h after admission to the emergency department , 139 patients ( 880 % ; 95 % CI 828-931 ) in the point-of-care ultrasonography group versus 100 ( 637 % ; 561-713 ) in the control group had correct presumptive diagnoses ( p < 00001 ) .",3
"The absolute and relative effects were 243 % ( 95 % CI 150-331 ) and 138 ( 101-131 ) , respectively .",3
No adverse events were reported .,3
"Point-of-care ultrasonography is a feasible , radiation free , diagnostic test , which alongside standard diagnostic tests is superior to standard diagnostic tests alone for establishing a correct diagnosis within 4 h.",4
It should therefore be considered for routine use as part of the standard diagnostic tests in the emergency department for patients admitted with respiratory symptoms .,4
"Computer experience moderated postintervention improvements in caregiving self-efficacy following CAPS , Specifically , parents in CAPS with low levels of prior use reporting the greatest improvements .",3
"CAPS participants who completed 5 or more sessions reported greater reductions in depression than did the IRC ; however , the groups did not differ on global distress .",3
Findings support the potential utility of counselor-supported Web-based interventions particularly for individuals with limited computer expertise following adolescent TBI .,4
Seven ( 2.4 % ) examined X-rays were scored as not assessable .,3
There was no statistical inferiority between the examinations with standard ( 0.365 mSv ) or reduced dose ( 0.211 mSv ) .,3
Reduced dose only led to limitations in the evaluation of ceramic components with low clinical impact in most scenarios .,3
Plain radiography of the pelvis in patients with THA or OS can be performed with a dose reduction of about 42 % without a loss of important information .,4
The obtained quality control criteria were clinically applicable .,4
Forty-seven subjects aged 1 to 6 years were enrolled .,3
Forty-seven caregivers were randomized to the tailored education ( n = 22 ) or non-tailored education ( n = 25 ) group .,3
The results of two-way ANOVA showed that interactions between groups were observed in the score of JPAC and asthma knowledge for preschool children whose asthma onset was within one year and a half .,3
The main effects of time were observed in the total and subscale score of QOL ( Quality of Life ) and the total score of P-CASES ( Parental Childhood Asthma 's Self-efficacy Scale ) .,3
These findings indicate the benefit of a tailored education program to control symptoms in such caregivers .,4
"The metabolomic patterns were significantly different between the patients maintained on lithium and those maintained on valproate , irrespective of response to ketamine .",3
"In the patients maintained on lithium , 18 biomarkers were identified .",3
"In responders , lysophosphatidylethanolamines ( 4 ) and lysophosphatidylcholines ( 9 ) were increased relative to non-responders .",3
The results indicate that the differences between patients who respond to ketamine and those who do not are due to alterations in the mitochondrial - oxidation of fatty acids .,4
These differences were not produced by ketamine administration .,4
The data indicate that pretreatment metabolomics screening may be a guide to the prediction of response and a potential approach to the individualization of ketamine therapy .,4
"Of 667 potential participants who underwent screening , 69 ( 10.3 % ) were randomized .",3
"Among the randomized participants , 30 ( 43 % ) had grade I obesity , and 56 ( 81 % ) were women .",3
"Mean ( SD ) age was 47.3 ( 6.4 ) years and hemoglobin A1c level , 7.9 % ( 2.0 % ) .",3
"After randomization , 7 participants ( 10 % ) refused to undergo their allocated intervention ( 3 RYGB , 1 LAGB , and 3 LWLI ) , and 1 RYGB participant was excluded for current smoking .",3
"Twenty participants underwent RYGB ; 21 , LAGB ; and 20 , LWLI , with 12-month retention rates of 90 % , 86 % , and 70 % , respectively .",3
"In the intention-to-treat cohort with multiple imputation for missing data , RYGB participants had the greatest mean weight loss from baseline ( 27.0 % ; 95 % CI , 30.8-23 .3 ) compared with LAGB ( 17.3 % ; 95 % CI , 21.1-13 .5 ) and LWLI ( 10.2 % ; 95 % CI , 14.8-5 .61 ) ( P < .001 ) .",3
"Partial and complete remission of T2DM were 50 % and 17 % , respectively , in the RYGB group and 27 % and 23 % , respectively , in the LAGB group ( P < .001 and P = .047 between groups for partial and complete remission ) , with no remission in the LWLI group .",3
Significant reductions in use of antidiabetics occurred in both surgical groups .,3
No deaths were noted .,3
The 3 serious adverse events included 1 ulcer treated medically in the RYGB group and 2 rehospitalizations for dehydration in the LAGB group .,3
"This study highlights several potential challenges to successful completion of a larger RCT for treatment of T2DM and obesity in patients with a body mass index of 30 to 40 , including the difficulties associated with recruiting and randomizing patients to surgical vs nonsurgical interventions .",4
"Preliminary results show that RYGB was the most effective treatment , followed by LAGB for weight loss and T2DM outcomes at 1 year .",4
"Total anaerobic counts of bacteria did not differ significantly between patients assigned to receive PDT and those assigned to receive surgical therapy ( mean , 95.2 % and 80.85 % , respectively ) .",4
PDT was associated with a significant decrease in bleeding scores ( P = 0.02 ) as well as inflammatory exudation ( P = 0.001 ) .,4
Treatment with PDT in patients with periimplantitis was not associated with major reduction of total anaerobic bacteria on the rough surfaces of dental implants as compared with surgical therapy .,4
A significantly lower proinflammatory index of periimplantitis was observed in the PDT group at 24 weeks of follow-up .,4
The protocol was readily applicable for planning process evaluation of environmental and educational intervention components in a school setting .,4
The protocol ensures systematic assessment of the implementation processes that are crucial for interpretation of intervention effects .,4
Thirty patients were enrolled .,3
"Three months postoperatively , the mean residual refractive astigmatism was 0.45 D 0.49 ( SD ) in the toric IOL group and 0.72 0.61 D in the PCRI group .",3
"The mean uncorrected distance visual acuity was 0.10 0.14 in the toric IOL group and 0.15 0.14 in the PCRI group and the mean uncorrected near visual acuity , 0.43 0.11 and 0.39 0.10 , respectively .",3
The mean absolute misalignment from the intended axis was 2.52 1.97 degrees .,3
The rotation was within 3 degrees in 90.9 % of all cases and within 6 degrees in all cases .,3
"On the questionnaire , 52.9 % of all patients said they required spectacles only when reading for a long time .",3
"Although refractive astigmatism decreased in both groups , multifocal toric IOL implantation was predictable with good rotational stability .",4
"Eighty-three patients were randomly allocated to 1 of the 3 groups ( 27 , 28 , and 28 , respectively ) .",3
"Despite 5 dropouts , the data from 78 participants were available for analysis with 10 % of scores missing .",3
"A minimum of 462 patients is required for a confirmatory 3-arm trial including the respective interventions , accounting for cluster effects and a 20 % dropout rate .",3
"Statistically significant and clinically meaningful changes in scores from baseline to week 5 were found for all groups for the Western Ontario and McMasters Osteoarthritis Index ( P .008 ) , with a greater change in scores for MMT and MMT plus rehabilitation .",3
Between-group comparison did not reveal statistically significant differences between group scores at week 5 for any of the outcome measures ( P .46 ) .,3
This pilot trial suggests that a confirmatory trial is feasible .,4
"There were significant changes in scores from baseline to week 5 across all groups , suggesting that all 3 treatment approaches may be of benefit to patients with mild-to-moderate knee OA , justifying a confirmatory trial to compare these interventions .",4
"Fifteen percent ( 466 of 3,144 ) of students attending intervention schools were vaccinated at school-located vaccination clinics .",3
"Among students vaccinated at school , 41 % were uninsured , 37 % publicly insured , and 22 % privately insured .",3
Estimated vaccine administration costs were $ 23.98 per vaccine dose .,3
Seventy-eight percent of vaccine purchase costs and 14 % of vaccine administration costs were reimbursed by insurers ; 41 % of total program costs were reimbursed .,3
"Sixth-grade students in intervention schools were more likely than those in control schools to receive tetanus-diphtheria-acellular pertussis ( risk ratio [ RR ] , 1.30 ; 95 % confidence interval [ CI ] , 1.08 , 1.57 ) , meningococcal conjugate ( RR , 1.42 ; CI , 1.18 , 1.70 ) , and human papillomavirus ( for females only , RR , 1.69 ; CI , 1.21 , 2.36 ) vaccines during the 2010-2011 school year , with similar results for seventh - to eighth-grade students .",3
"Although school-located adolescent vaccination with billing appears feasible and likely to improve vaccination rates , improvements in insurance coverage and reimbursement rates may be needed for the long-term financial sustainability of such programs .",4
"Mean age was 59.312.0 years , 963 ( 62 % ) were men , and 1045 ( 67 % ) had longstanding hypertension .",3
Clinic attendance dropped from 91 ( week 6 ) to 83 % ( week 26 ) and pharmacological instructions were followed for 93 % ( baseline ) to 61 % at week 14 ( uptitration failures commonly representing protocol deviations ) .,3
"Overall , 26-week BP levels and BP target attainment ranged from 13214/799 and 51 % to 14115/8311 mmHg and 19 % in those participants subject to the highest ( n = 270 , 26 % ) versus least ( n = 148 , 14 % ) per protocol adherence , respectively ; adjusted relative risk ( RR ) 1.22 per unit protocol adherence score , 95 % confidence interval ( CI ) 1.15-1 .31 ; for achieving BP target ( P < 0.001 ) .",3
"Participants with a per protocol score of 4 or 5 ( 512/1038 , 49.3 % ) were 1.54-fold ( 95 % CI 1.31-1 .81 ; P < 0.001 ) more likely to achieve their individual BP target compared with usual care .",3
"Clinics equipped with a practice nurse significantly influenced protocol adherence ( adjusted RR 1.20 , 95 % CI 1.06-1 .37 ; P = 0.004 ) and individual BP control ( RR 1.21 , 95 % CI 1.04-1 .41 ; P = 0.015 ) .",3
"There is considerable potential for structured care management to improve BP control in primary care , especially when optimally applied .",4
"One hundred forty-three non-diabetic adult RA patients ( 76.2 % female , age 55.2 12.1 [ mean SD ] ) on stable RA standard of care treatment were enrolled in a randomized , double-blind placebo controlled crossover trial of 45 mg daily pioglitazone versus placebo , with a 3-month duration/arm and a 2-month washout period .",3
"Pulse wave velocity of the aorta ( PWV ) , brachial artery flow mediated dilatation ( FMD ) , nitroglycerin mediated dilatation ( NMD ) , microvascular endothelial function ( reactive hyperemia index [ RHI ] ) , and circulating biomarkers of inflammation , insulin resistance , and atherosclerosis risk all were quantified .",3
RA disease activity was assessed with the 28-Joint Count Disease Activity Score ( DAS-28 ) C-reactive protein ( CRP ) and the Short Form ( 36 ) Health Survey quality of life questionnaire .,3
"When added to standard of care RA treatment , pioglitazone significantly decreased pulse wave velocity ( ie , aortic stiffness ) ( P = 0.01 ) , while FMD and RHI remained unchanged when compared to treatment with placebo .",3
"Further , pioglitazone significantly reduced RA disease activity ( P = 0.02 ) and CRP levels ( P = 0.001 ) , while improving lipid profiles .",3
The drug was well tolerated .,3
Addition of pioglitazone to RA standard of care significantly improves aortic elasticity and decreases inflammation and disease activity with minimal safety issues .,4
The clinical implications of these findings remain to be established .,4
"PTX3 levels were inversely associated with BMI and WC as well as with total and visceral fat ( P < 0.05 for all ; adjusted for age , inflammatory biomarkers and cardiovascular risk factors ) .",3
The association between PTX3 and BMI appeared even stronger in nonobese individuals .,3
A decrease in BMI over 5 years as well as weight loss following the NORDIET intervention were associated with increased serum PTX3 concentrations ( P < 0.001 ) .,3
"These consistent data support an inverse association between circulating PTX3 and anthropometrical measures , calling for further mechanistic studies of the link between PTX3 and fat .",4
The primary endpoint is the protection of the extraperitoneal colo-rectal anastomosis in terms of incidence of symptomatic and asymptomatic anastomotic leakages .,3
The secondary endpoints are the evaluation of complications due to the placement and the removal of the exclusion probe for percutaneous ileostomy .,3
"The ALPPI trial is designed to provide the surgical community with an evidence based new technique in the protection of low colo-rectal anastomosis , alternative to the conventional stomas .",4
"The efficacy of UltraEZ on dentin hypersensitivity was significantly better than that of the corresponding placebo group on day 7 during the treatment , whereas the efficacy of MI Paste exhibited better than that of the placebo group on day 14 during the treatment .",3
"However , there were no differences between the efficacy of the two agents on day 14 during the treatment , day 30 or day 60 posttreatment .",3
Both UltraEZ and MI Paste had a significant effect on dentin hypersensitivity .,4
"UltraEZ showed quicker effects than MI Paste , but MI Paste had a greater sustained action after treatment than UltraEZ .",4
Anterior laxity was decreased and quadriceps/hamstring muscle strength was increased in the acute group compared to the chronic group ( p > 0.05 ) .,3
"There were no statistically significant differences in Lysholm scores , Tegner activity scores , and the IKDC evaluation form between the two groups .",3
These results suggest that earlier ACL reconstruction using a LARS artificial ligament may provide an advantage in the treatment and rehabilitation of ACL rupture .,4
"Energy intake was significantly lower in the 30En % - protein condition ( 8.73 1.93 MJ/d ) than in the 5En % - protein ( 9.48 1.67 MJ/d ) and 15En % - protein ( 9.30 1.62 MJ/d ) conditions ( P = 0.001 ) , stemming largely from lower energy intake during meals ( P = 0.001 ) .",3
Hunger ( P = 0.001 ) and desire to eat ( P = 0.001 ) ratings were higher and fullness ratings were lower ( P = 0.001 ) in the 5En % - protein condition than in the 15En % - protein and 30En % - protein conditions .,3
Nitrogen excretion was lower in the 5En % - protein condition ( 4.7 1.5 g/24 h ; P = 0.001 ) and was higher in the 30En % - protein condition ( 15.3 8.7 g/24 h ; P = 0.001 ) compared with the 15En % - protein condition ( 10.0 5.2 g/24 h ) .,3
Nitrogen balance was maintained in the 5En % - protein condition and was positive in the 15En % - and 30En % - protein conditions ( P = 0.001 ) .,3
Complete protein leverage did not occur because subjects did not consume to a common protein amount at the expense of energy balance .,4
Individuals did underconsume relative to energy requirements from high-protein diets .,4
The lack of support for protein leverage effects on a low-protein diet may stem from the fact that protein intake was sufficient to maintain nitrogen balance over the 12-d trial .,4
"Between April 1996 and July 2003 , a total of 250 patients were enrolled .",3
"Of 239 patients analyzable for outcomes , 94 % were male , 83 % had a Karnofsky performance status of 90-100 , and 62 % had T2a tumor .",3
"Median follow-up for all surviving patients was 7.9 years ( range , 0.6-13 .1 years ) .",3
"The 5-year local control ( LC ) rate was 8 points higher but not statistically significant ( P = .14 for HFX [ 78 % ] vs SFX [ 70 % ] ) , corresponding to a 30 % hazard rate reduction .",3
The 5-year disease-free survival ( DFS ) was 49 % versus 40 % ( P = .13 ) and overall survival ( OS ) was 72 % versus 63 % ( P = .29 ) .,3
"HFX was associated with higher rates of acute skin , mucosal , and laryngeal toxicity .",3
Grade 3-4 late effects were similar with a 5-year cumulative incidence of 8.5 % ( 3.4 % -13.6 % ) after SFX and 8.5 % ( 3.4 % -13.5 % ) after HFX .,3
"The 5-year local control was modestly higher with HFX compared to SFX for T2 glottic carcinoma , but the difference was not statistically significant .",4
These results are consistent with prior studies of hyperfractionation showing a benefit in local control .,4
Substaging by T2a versus T2b carries prognostic value for DFS and OS .,4
For cost and convenience reasons other altered fractionation schedules have been adopted in routine practice .,4
The response rate was 32 % ( 95 % CI 17-51 % ) for Bev-Tem ( n = 32 ) and 23 % ( 95 % CI 9-44 % ) for Bev-Iri ( n = 31 ) ( p = 0.56 ) .,3
"Median PFS was 7.7 and 7.3 months for Bev-Tem and Bev-Iri , respectively .",3
Hematological toxicity was more frequent with Bev-Tem including one death from febrile neutropenia whereas non-hematological toxicity was manageable .,3
Only the Bev-Tem arm met the pre-specified level of activity of interest .,4
Our results did not indicate any benefit from Bev-Iri in first-line therapy as opposed to Bev-Tem in terms of response and PFS .,4
SANS and SAPS scores decreased significantly in both groups .,3
"Mean SAPS score reduction in risperidone and aripiprazole group was 16.20 and 10.80 , respectively , after trial course ( p < 0.001 ) .",3
"Mean SANS score reduction in risperidone and aripiprazole group was 9.35 and 11.25 , respectively ( p = 0.08 ) .",3
Both aripiprazole and risperidone were effective for patients diagnosed with amphetamine-induced psychotic disorder .,4
"However , risperidone had the greater effect on positive psychotic symptoms while patients with negative symptoms may respond better to aripiprazole .",4
There is a case for further studies evaluating the efficacy of atypical antipsychotics in this disorder .,4
"147 patients were randomized ( median age : 608 years , PS 0/1/2 : 44/83/20 patients ; males : 78 % ) .",3
"The ED strategy was rejected , with only 18 of 73 patients achieving PFS15 in arm ED at the end of stage 2 and 17 of 74 patients in arm D.",3
"In arms ED and D , respectively , median PFS was 2.2 and 2.5 months and median OS was 6.5 and 8.3 months .",3
Sequential erlotinib and docetaxel was not more effective than docetaxel alone as second-line treatment for advanced NSCLC with wild-type or unknown EGFR status .,4
"One month post-dose 3 , for each of the vaccine pneumococcal serotypes , e `` 90.1 % of PHiD-CV recipients had an antibody concentration e `` 0.2 ug/mL compared to < 9 % ( except for serotypes 14 [ 32.4 % ] and 19F [ 27.8 % ] ) in the control group .",3
"For each of the vaccine pneumococcal serotypes , e `` 90.6 % of infants in the PHiD-CV group had an OPA titre e `` 8 , compared to % 18 % ( except for serotype 7F [ 60.0 % ] ) in the control group .",3
Anti-protein D antibody geometric mean antibody concentrations were 2949.7 EL.U / mL in the PHiD-CV group and 68.9 EL.U / mL in the control group .,3
For each DTPw-HBV/Hib antigen antibody seroprotection/seropositivity rates were e `` 94.4 % .,3
Tolerability was generally comparable between the PHiD-CV and control vaccination groups .,3
PHiD-CV co-administered with routine vaccines was immunogenic for all vaccine pneumococcal serotypes and protein D in Nigerian infants .,4
Vaccine tolerability was generally comparable between the PHiD-CV and control groups .,4
These results suggest PHiD-CV can be co-administered with other vaccines included in the National Programme on Immunisation .,4
Results of the study will be disseminated via peer-reviewed publications and presentations at scientific conferences .,3
One hundred sixty-nine ( 86 % ) children completed the follow-up .,3
Statistical analysis of adjusted progression rates showed a mean ( SE ) progression of -1.39 0.09 D in the control group wearing SVLs at the 24-month visit .,3
"Statistically significant ( P = 0.017 ) retardation of myopia progression ( 0.27 0.11 D during 24-month period or reduction ratio of 20 % ) by +1.5 D add PA-PALs relative to the SVLs was found , which was within the range of the percentage efficacy of myopia retardation by the conventional PALs in earlier trials over the same follow-up period .",3
Nearly all retardation occurred in the first 12 months with no significant efficacy in the second year .,3
Positively aspherized-PALs with +1.0 D addition showed negligible efficacy .,3
"To the extent that has been tested and that can be tolerated by wearers of spectacle lenses , the high positive aspherization of the distance zone added to PALs does not enhance their therapeutic efficacy in slowing myopia progression .",4

"During HPC process , the patients in group HPC experienced mild hypoxia and CO2 retention .",3
"With the times of HPC increasing , CO2 retention degree became heavier ( P < 0.05 ) while hypoxia improved , the patients need more time to make SpO2 from 100 % to 90 % ( P < 0.05 ) .",3
"From T2 to T4 ( the end of the third reoxygenation , during skull opened and aneurysm dipped , skull closed ) , NGB in group HPC was higher than that in control ( P < 0.05 ) , but S-100B level was not different between HPC and control group ( P > 0.05 ) .",3
"HPC could induce compensatory ability of the body to hypoxia , which might be related to the up-regulation of NGB expression .",4
"The SpS-SubmSv IRT resulted in 75 % ( 0.2 / 0.9 mSv ) and 92 % ( 0.2 / 2.9 mSv ) dose reduction , when compared with the fully sampled SubmSv-FBP and SD-FBP , respectively .",3
"Images of SpS-SubmSv displayed all 46 lesions ( most < 1 cm , 30 lung nodules , 7 ground glass opacities , 9 emphysema ) seen on the SubmSv-FBP and SD-FBP data sets .",3
Lesion margins with sparse-sampled data were deemed acceptable compared with both SubmSv-FBP and SD-FBP .,3
Overall diagnostic confidence was maintained with SpS-SubmSv IRT despite the presence of minor pixilation artifacts in 3 of 10 cases .,3
"The SpS-SubmSv IRT showed 63 % and 38 % noise reduction when compared with SubmSv-FBP ( P < 0.0001 ) and SD-FBP ( P < 0.01 ) , respectively , with no significant change in Hounsfield unit values ( P > 0.05 ) .",3
Noise-spectral density showed that SpS-SubmSv IRT gives a linear decrease over frequency in the semilog plot and an exponential decrease of noise power over frequency compared with SubmSv-FBP and SD-FBP .,3
More than 90 % dose reduction could be achieved with one-fourth sparse-sampled and SubmSv chest CT examination when reconstructed with IRT .,4
Chest CT dose at one fourth of a millisievert with SpS is possible with optimal lesion detection and diagnostic confidence for the evaluation of pulmonary findings .,4
"Analyses revealed significant differences in cortisol production at the preschool follow-up , such that children in the ABC intervention group showed more typical patterns of cortisol production than children in the control intervention group .",3
"Specifically , children in the ABC group exhibited higher mean ( SD ) log-transformed morning levels than children in the control group ( -0.87 [ 0.45 ] vs -1.05 [ 0.43 ] g/dL , respectively [ to convert to nanomoles per liter , multiply by 27.588 ] ; = 0.18 ; P = .03 ) .",3
"Bedtime cortisol levels did not differ significantly between the ABC and DEF groups ( mean [ SD ] , -1.19 [ 0.49 ] vs -1.17 [ 0.48 ] g/dL , respectively ; 01 = -0.01 ; P = .87 ) .",3
"Those in the ABC group showed a steeper decline in cortisol across the day ( mean , -0.31 g/dL ) than those in the control group , who showed a blunted cortisol rhythm ( mean , -0.12 g/dL ) ( = -0.19 ; P = .02 ) .",3
Differences in cortisol production between the experimental and control groups persisted at the preschool follow-up and resembled differences initially observed 3 months following intervention .,4
This is encouraging evidence that the ABC intervention for Child Protective Services-referred children may have long-lasting effects on a physiological stress system critical for health and adjustment .,4
All women in Part-I and 60 % women in Part-II had serum-25 ( OH ) D < 50nmol/l .,3
Serum-25 ( OH ) D was higher in prescribed vitamin D users than nonusers ( P = 0.001 ) and in Iranians than Arab women ( P = 0.001 ; Part-I ) .,3
"Mean ( s.d. ) serum-25 ( OH ) D increased in all groups ( time effect , P < 0.001 ) and differed between groups ( time dosage interaction , P < 0.001 ; 50,000 IU : from 44.016.0 to 70.015.0 nmol/l ; 100,000 IU : 48.011.0 to 82.017.0 nmol/l ; placebo : 45.018.0 to 54.018.0 nmol/l ) .",3
"Only 32 % and 67 % achieved serum-25 ( OH ) D75nmol/l with 50,000 and 100,000 IU/month , respectively .",3
Predictors of 6-month change in serum-25 ( OH ) D were dose ( B-coefficients .,3
"e. ; 14.12.4 , P < 0.001 ) , baseline serum-25 ( OH ) D ( -0.60.1 , P < 0.001 ) and body fat percentage ( -0.70.3 , P = 0.01 ) .",3
Vitamin D deficiency/insufficiency is highly prevalent in this population .,4
"Monthly 100,000 IU vitamin D for 6 months is more effective than 50,000 IU in achieving serum-25 ( OH ) D 75nmol/l ; however , a third of women still did not achieve these levels .",4
Sixty patients were randomized and 56 underwent surgery between March 2010 and June 2012 .,3
Twenty-nine underwent microcoil localization and 27 did not .,3
"The baseline characteristics ( age , sex , forced expiratory volume in the first second of expiration , nodule size/depth ) were similar .",3
"The coil group had a higher rate of successful diagnosis with VATS wedge resection alone ( 27/29 vs 13/27 ; P < .001 ) , decreased operative time to nodule excision ( 37 39 vs 100 67 minutes ; P < .001 ) , and reduced stapler firings ( 3.7 2.0 vs 5.9 31 ; P = .003 ) with no difference in total costs .",3
"Pathologic diagnoses included 14 benign nodules , 32 primary lung malignancies , and 10 metastases .",3
There were no clinically significant complications related to the coil placement or wedge resection .,3
Preoperative CT-guided microcoil localization decreases the need for thoracotomy or VATS anatomic resection for the diagnosis of small peripheral pulmonary nodules .,4
The GA sides had statistically significant reductions in acne lesions at each time point from baseline values .,3
There were statistically significant differences between the GA and placebo sides .,3
The GA sides had better responses for noninflammatory lesions than for inflammatory lesions .,3
"In bioengineering measurements , sebum levels were statistically significantly reduced after the initiation of therapy on both sides at weeks 8 and 10 , but there were no statistically significant differences between the two sides .",3
Forty percent GA peels significantly improved moderate acne in this study .,4
It is effective and safe in Asians .,4
"I-IMR participants attended 15.8 9.5 I-IMR and 8.2 5.9 nurse sessions , with 75 % attending at least ten I-IMR and five nurse sessions .",3
"Compared with usual care , I-IMR was associated with greater improvements in participant and clinician ratings for psychiatric illness self-management , greater diabetes self-management , and an increased preference for detailed diagnosis and treatment information during primary care encounters .",3
The proportion of I-IMR participants with at least one psychiatric or general medical hospitalization decreased significantly between baseline and ten - and 14-month follow-ups .,3
I-IMR is a feasible intervention for this at-risk group and demonstrated potential effectiveness by improving self-management of psychiatric illness and diabetes and by reducing the proportion of participants requiring psychiatric or general medical hospitalizations .,4
The Crystalens AO and ReSTOR +3.0 demonstrated better monocular and binocular contrast sensitivity without glare at low to mid spatial frequencies compared with the Tecnis Multifocal lens .,3
Binocular uncorrected distance VA was not significantly different between the 3 lenses .,3
The Crystalens AO had significantly better binocular low-contrast distance-corrected VA than the ReSTOR +3.0 and better mean monocular low-contrast DCVA than the Tecnis Multifocal lens .,3
The Crystalens AO demonstrated significantly better monocular and binocular uncorrected and distance-corrected intermediate VA than the ReSTOR +3.0 or Tecnis Multifocal lenses .,3
The ReSTOR +3.0 lens had significantly better monocular and binocular uncorrected and distance-corrected near VA tested at 40cm compared with the Crystalens AO and Tecnis Multifocal lens .,3
The Crystalens AO elicited significantly less halos than the Tecnis Multifocal lens and less optical scatter than the ReSTOR +3.0 or Tecnis Multifocal lens .,3
The Crystalens AO had statistically better uncorrected intermediate VA and distance-corrected intermediate VA than the ReSTOR +3.0 or Tecnis Multifocal lenses and fewer photic phenomenon than the Tecnis Multifocal lens .,4
Both multifocals had better distance-corrected near VA and uncorrected near VA than the Crystalens AO .,4
These findings may guide intraocular lens selection for individual patients seeking to optimize vision at specific vergences or lighting conditions .,4
"The scores for symptoms decreased between the assessments in both groups ( -1.73.9 in the experimental group ; -0.61.6 in the control group ) , with no significant difference between groups ( P = 0.205 ) .",3
The scores for clinical signs decreased between the assessments in the experimental group ( -1.12.7 ) and increased in the control group ( 0.30.9 ) but with no significant differences ( P = 0.205 ) .,3

"The isolated use of tacrolimus and the combined use of tacrolimus and olopatadine seems to have the same efficacy , although controlled studies with larger samples are required to confirm this hypothesis .",4
A two-compartment model with a single transit compartment and first-order elimination from the central compartment most adequately described mefloquine concentration-time data .,3
"The model incorporated population parameter variability for clearance ( CL/F ) , central volume of distribution ( VC/F ) and absorption rate constant ( KA ) and identified , in addition to body weight , malaria infection as a covariate for VC/F ( but not CL/F ) .",3
Monte Carlo simulations predict that falciparum malaria infection is associated with a shorter elimination half-life ( 407 versus 566 h ) and T > MIC ( 766 versus 893 h ) .,3
This is the first known population pharmacokinetic study to show falciparum malaria to influence mefloquine disposition .,4
"Protein binding , anaemia and other factors may contribute to differences between healthy individuals and patients .",4
"As VC/F is related to the earlier portion of the concentration-time profiles , which occurs during acute malaria , and CL/F is more related to the terminal phase during convalescence after treatment , this may explain why malaria was found to be a covariate for VC/F but not CL/F .",4
"This study is the first to investigate the effect of a standardized physical therapy treatment protocol on somatic tinnitus with a prospective comparative delayed design and with blinded evaluator for baseline , end of therapy , and 6 and 12 weeks after therapy .",4

"Hs-cTnT as a risk factor for the primary end point ( cardiovascular death , nonfatal myocardial infarction , and nonfatal stroke ; n = 356 ) , as well as all-cause mortality ( n = 366 ) , cardiovascular mortality ( n = 299 ) , and the composite of cardiovascular mortality and hospitalization from worsening of HF ( n = 465 ) , was investigated in 1245 patients ( 60 years ; New York Heart Association [ NYHA ] class II-IV , ischemic systolic HF ) randomly assigned to 10 mg rosuvastatin or placebo .",3
"In multivariable analyses , adjusting for left ventricular ejection fraction , NYHA class , age , body mass index , diabetes mellitus , sex , intermittent claudication , heart rate , estimated glomerular filtration rate , apolipoprotein B/apolipoprotein A-1 ratio , amino-terminal probrain natriuretic peptide , high-sensitivity C-reactive protein , and hs-cTnT ( both dichotomized according to the 99th percentile and as a continuous variable ) was associated with all end points ( primary end point : hazard ratio , 1.87 and 1.51 , respectively , per SD change ; P < 0.001 ; all other end points : hazard ratio , 1.39-1 .70 ) .",3
"However , improved discrimination as assessed by C-statistics was only seen for the primary end point and all-cause mortality .",3
Elevated hs-cTnT levels provide strong and independent prognostic information in older patients with chronic ischemic HF .,4
"Statistically significant differences were detected between group 1 and group 2 in the mean pain score on VAS ( 2.53 1.34 vs 1.63 1.09 , P = 0.002 , Mann-Whitney U test ) , mean postprocedural State Anxiety Inventory pain score ( 39.4 6.5 vs 34.5 5.8 ) , and postprocedural pulse rate ( 79.8 5.5 vs 76.0 7.3 ) ( P < 0.001 for both , t test ) .",3
Patients who listened to their preferred music experienced less discomfort and lower anxiety at cystoscopy .,3
"Patient age , duration of the procedure , preprocedural STAI-S , and preprocedural pulse rate of each group were comparable .",3
Listening to preferred music during flexible cystoscopy is an easy way to improves male patients ' comfort and reduce their anxiety .,4
It could be recommended for male patients .,4
"Of 110 patients enrolled , 101 patients remained for analysis .",3
Patients in the placebo group had significantly higher mean ( SD ) throat pain scores than did patients in both drug groups on postsurgery days 1 through 4 .,3
Day 1 scores were 8.00 ( 1.84 ) for placebo and 6.00 ( 1.84 ) for sucralfate and 6.79 ( 1.87 ) for clindamycin ( P = .001 ) .,3
Pain scores were not significantly different on day 5 .,3
"Acetaminophen use was more common in the placebo group on days 3 and 4 ( 2.97 and 2.44 ) vs the sucralfate group ( 2.24 and 2.15 ) and the clindamycin group ( 2.36 and 2.12 ) ( P = .001 and .02 , respectively ) .",3
Bleeding on day 1 was more common in the placebo group ( 3 of 34 ) vs none in the drug groups .,3

"Our results revealed that moderately intense pain is associated with routine orthodontic treatment , and that the amount of pain individuals perceive varies widely .",3
"We observed statistically significant differences in the pain control among the three groups , and that etoricoxib 60mg proved most efficient .",3
Etoricoxib 60mg is highly efficacious for controlling pain during fixed orthodontic appliance therapy .,4
This was an a priori planned post hoc analysis involving 754 NSTE-ACS patients from the randomised BASKET-PROVE trial ( sirolimus-eluting stent vs. everolimus-eluting stent vs. bare metal stent in large-vessel stenting ) .,3
The primary endpoint was the combined two-year rate of cardiovascular death or non-fatal myocardial infarction ( MI ) .,3
"Secondary endpoints were each component of the primary endpoint , and clinically indicated target vessel revascularisation ( TVR ) and stent thrombosis .",3
"Compared to patients with BMS , those treated with SES and EES had a strong trend towards lower two-year rates of the primary endpoint ( HR : 0.31 [ CI : 0.11-0 .90 ] , p = 0.03 , and HR : 0.74 [ CI : 0.44-1 .24 ] , p = 0.25 ) , and of TVR ( HR : 0.58 [ CI : 0.29-1 .15 ] , p = 0.12 ) and ( HR : 0.52 [ CI : 0.34-0 .78 ] , p = 0.002 ) .",3
"When the SES and EES groups were combined and compared to BMS , significant reductions in both cardiovascular death/MI and TVR were found .",3
"Compared with BMS , use of DES in NSTE-ACS patients undergoing stent implantation in large vessels was associated with a reduction in both TVR and the combined endpoint consisting of cardiovascular death/MI .",4
"Thus , DES use improves both efficacy and safety .",4
These findings support the use of DES in NSTE-ACS patients .,4
Counseling African Americans to Control Hypertension is a cluster-randomized clinical trial in which 30 community health centers were randomly assigned to the intervention condition ( IC ) or usual care ( UC ) .,3
"Patients at the IC sites received patient education , home BP monitoring , and monthly lifestyle counseling , whereas physicians attended monthly hypertension case rounds and received feedback on their patients ' home BP readings and chart audits .",3

PFS rates at 4 months were 56 % and 45 % respectively .,3
The majority of treatment-related adverse events ( AEs ) were grade 1-2 .,3
"Grade 3-4 AEs ( pazopanib versus placebo ) were hypertension ( 38 % versus 8 % ) , neutropenia ( 8 % versus 0 % ) , and elevated SGPT ( 6 % versus 0 % ) .",3
"Of the patients randomised to pazopanib , 22 % withdrew due to a treatment-related AE .",3
Switch maintenance with pazopanib following platinum-based chemotherapy in advanced NSCLC patients had limited side-effects .,4
This study was stopped due to lack of efficacy by stringent criteria for PFS at a futility interim analysis .,4
"The mean total DAP results in the organic phase were 89 % lower than in the conventional phase ( M = 0.032 [ SD = 0.038 ] and 0.294 [ SD = 0.435 ] respectively , p = 0.013 ) .",3

"Mean total diethyl DAP levels in the organic phase were half those of the conventional phase ( M = 0.021 [ SD = 0.020 ] and 0.042 [ SD = 0.038 ] respectively ) , yet the wide variability and small sample size meant the difference was not statistically significant .",3
The consumption of an organic diet for one week significantly reduced OP pesticide exposure in adults .,4
Larger scale studies in different populations are required to confirm these findings and investigate their clinical relevance .,4
The maximum maternal plasma concentration was reached within 1 hour and exceeded the in vitro minimum inhibitory concentration ( MIC50 ) of 250 ng/mL of Ureaplasma spp in all 30 patients .,3

"Analysis of the interviews , support calls and focus group identified three themes in relation to the delivery and experience of PLANS .",3
These are : formulation of ` health ' in the context of everyday life ; trajectories and tipping points : disrupting everyday routines ; precarious trust in networks .,3
"The relevance of these themes are considered using NPT constructs in terms of the work that is entailed in engaging with PLANS , taking action , and who is implicated this process .",3
PLANS gives scope to align long-term condition management to everyday life priorities and valued aspects of life .,4
This approach can improve engagement with health-relevant practices by situating them within everyday contexts .,4
This has potential to increase utilisation of local resources with potential cost-saving benefits for the NHS .,4
Treatment with acupuncture significantly reduced the occurrence of hot flushes and sudden sweating ( p < .001 ) .,3

"Factorial ANOVAs with repeated measures of group by leg and by test occasion revealed significantly superior improvements for KOOS , IKDC , PF , EMD , and FE associated with N-CON vs. CON rehabilitation ( F ( 1.5,13.4 GG ) = 3.7-4 .7 , P < .05 ) .",3
These results confirm increased peak effectiveness of N-CON rehabilitation ( ~ 4.5-13 .3 % better than CON over 48 wk of rehabilitation ) .,3
N-CON and CON showed similar patterns of improvement for single-leg-hop test and RFD .,3
Nonconcurrent strength and cardiovascular-endurance conditioning during 48 wk of rehabilitation after ACI surgery elicited significantly greater improvements to functional and neuromuscular outcomes than did contemporary concurrent rehabilitation .,4
Outpatient administration of misoprostol was as effective as inpatient treatment with success rate of 89.2 and 85.7 % ( p = 0.520 ) .,3
The side effects were not significantly different between the two groups .,3
Side effects that occurred were minor and only required symptomatic treatment .,3
Duration of bleeding was 6.0 days in both groups ( p = 0.317 ) .,3
Mean reduction in haemoglobin was lesser in the outpatient group ( 0.4 g/dl ) as compared to in the inpatient group ( 0.6 g/dl ) which was statistically significant ( p = 0.048 ) .,3
Medical evacuation using intra-vaginal misoprostol 800 mcg eight hourly for a maximum of three doses in an outpatient setting is as effective as in inpatient setting with tolerable side effects .,4
Directional error rates are increased when the control and response are in opposite directions or if the direction of the control and response are perpendicular.The pattern of direction error rates was consistent with experiments obtained from a generic device in a virtual environment .,3
Error rates are increased by incompatible directional control-response relationships .,4
"Ensuring that the design of equipment controls maintains compatible directional control-response relationships has potential to reduce the errors made in high-risk situations , such as underground coal mining .",4
"Following 10-14 days of treatment , both groups showed clinical improvement and the favorable changes in cardiac structural and functional parameters and HRV values , which were more pronounced in the patients receiving meldonium .",3
"The patients with CHF using meldonium as part of combination therapy in the early post-infarction period were observed to have clinical improvement , a significant reduction in the rate of angina attacks and in the need for nitrates , a decrease in the number of arrhythmic and ischemic episodes , and favorable changes in cardiac structural and functional parameters and HRV values .",4
Findings suggest that POWeR is acceptable and potentially effective .,3
"Providing human support enhanced usage in our trials , but was not unproblematic .",3
"Interestingly , there were some indications that more basic ( brief ) human support may produce more sustainable weight loss outcomes than more regular support .",3
"Qualitative interviews suggested that more regular support might foster reliance , meaning patients can not sustain their weight losses when support ends .",3
Qualitative findings in the community trial also suggested explanations for why many people may not take up the opportunity for human support .,3
Integrating findings from both our qualitative and quantitative studies provided far richer insights than would have been gained using only a single method of inquiry .,4
Further research should investigate the optimum delivery of human support needed to maximize sustainable weight loss in online interventions .,4
Statement of contribution What is already known on this subject ?,4
There is evidence that human support may increase the effectiveness of e-health interventions .,4
It is unclear what level of human support might be optimal or how human support improves effectiveness .,4
Triangulation of quantitative and qualitative methods can be used to inform the design and implementation of interventions What does this study add ?,4
This paper demonstrates the value of a mixed methods approach when developing and evaluating an intervention .,4
Qualitative methods provided complementary insights into the optimal level of human support .,4
Brief human support is valued by some and may enhance usage and outcomes of an e-health intervention for weight loss .,4
There were no significant differences in the patients ' demographics .,3
"The mean ( SD ) ages for the two groups were 72.4 ( 8.2 ) and 72.1 ( 7.4 ) years ( P = 0.6 ) , respectively .",3
The mean EuroSCORE was 6.39 ( 2.2 ) for Group A and 6.48 ( 2.6 ) for Group B ( P = 0.9 ) .,3
"The median intubation times were 14.7 ( 7.3 , 2927.2 ) h and 13 ( 2.5 , 528.7 ) h , respectively .",3
"VAP incidence was significantly lower in the Venner-PneuX ET group , being 10.8 % when compared with 21 % in the standard ET group ( P = 0.03 ) .",3
There was no significant difference between the two groups in terms of intensive care unit stay ( P = 0.2 ) and in-hospital mortality ( P = 0.2 ) .,3
"A binary logistic regression analysis ( type of ET tube , age , LVEF , history of lung disease , smoking history , surgical procedure , EuroSCORE , cardiopulmonary bypass time , blood transfusion , intubation duration among others ) confirmed that the Venner-PneuX ET tube was associated with significant VAP reduction ( Odds ratio 0.45 , P = 0.03 ) .",3
The Venner-PneuX VAP prevention system is associated with a significant reduction in VAP .,4
This can potentially lead to significant cost reductions and should be implemented as part of the VAP reduction bundle .,4
"Of 211 infants who were randomized , 104 were randomized to the control group and 107 to the LISA group .",3
"Of the infants who received LISA , 72 ( 67.3 % ) survived without BPD compared with 61 ( 58.7 % ) of those in the control group .",3
"The reduction in absolute risk was 8.6 % ( 95 % CI , -5.0 % to 21.9 % ; P = .20 ) .",3
Intervention group infants were less frequently intubated ( 80 infants [ 74.8 % ] vs 103 [ 99.0 % ] ; P < .001 ) and required fewer days of mechanical ventilation .,3
"Significant reductions were seen in pneumothorax ( 5 of 105 intervention group infants [ 4.8 % ] vs 13 of 103 12.6 % ] ; P = .04 ) and severe intraventricular hemorrhage ( 11 infants [ 10.3 % ] vs 23 [ 22.1 % ] ; P = .02 ) , and the combined survival without severe adverse events was increased in the intervention group ( 54 infants [ 50.5 % ] vs 37 [ 35.6 % ] ; P = .02 ; absolute risk reduction , 14.9 ; 95 % CI , 1.4 to 28.2 ) .",3
LISA did not increase survival without BPD but was associated with increased survival without major complications .,4
"Because major complications are related to lifelong disabilities , LISA may be a promising therapy for extremely preterm infants .",4
This two-group online individually randomised controlled trial recruited employees from a UK-based private sector organisation ( approx .,3
"100,000 employees ) .",3
"3,375 employees completed the online health check in the three week recruitment period .",3
"Of these , 1,330 ( 39 % ) scored five or more on the AUDIT-C ( indicating alcohol misuse ) and were randomised to receive personalised feedback on their alcohol intake , alongside feedback on other health behaviours ( n = 659 ) , or to receive feedback on all health behaviours except alcohol intake ( n = 671 ) .",3
"Participants were mostly male ( 75 % ) , with a median age of 48 years and half were in managerial positions ( 55 % ) .",3
"Median Body Mass Index was 26 , 12 % were smokers , median time undertaking moderate/vigorous physical activity a week was 173 minutes and median fruit and vegetable consumption was three portions a day .",3
"Eighty percent ( n = 1,066 ) of participants completed follow-up questionnaires at three months .",3
"An intention to treat analysis found no difference between experimental groups for past week drinking ( primary outcome ) ( 5.6 % increase associated with the intervention ( 95 % CI -4.7 % to 16.9 % ; p = .30 ) ) , AUDIT ( measure of alcohol-related harm ) and health utility ( EQ-5D ) .",3
There was no evidence to support the use of personalised feedback within an online health check for reducing alcohol consumption among employees in this organisation .,4
Further research is needed on how to engage a larger proportion of employees in screening .,4
"Participants ran at a mean self-selected speed of 3.10.3 m/s for both conditions , at intensities corresponding to mean HR values of 146 bpm ( shod ) and 144 bpm ( barefoot ) .",3
"Steady State VO2 was not different between the shod and barefoot conditions ( 39.4 4.7 mL/kg * min vs. 405.2 mL/kg * min , respectively ) .",3
The total energy expended in the shod and barefoot conditions was 974134 kJ and 979142 kJ .,3
"The average non-protein respiratory exchange ratios , proportions and amount of fat and carbohydrate used were not different between conditions .",3
Cadence was 2.5 % higher and center of gravity vertical displacement was 0.5 cm less for the barefoot condition ( P < 0.05 ) .,3
"In trained mid-forefoot runners experienced with barefoot running , there are not significant metabolic differences between shod and barefoot running conditions .",4
Barefoot running increases cadence and decreases foot contact time and vertical displacement .,4
Experienced participants were likely able to titrate kinematics to standardize energy output and fuel use for a given running distance and speed irrespective of shoe wear .,4
"From Dec 1 , 2009 , to May 21 , 2014 , of 2911 patients assessed for eligibility , 785 patients were randomly assigned to either the prednisone group ( n = 392 ) or the placebo group ( n = 393 ) .",3
"Median time to clinical stability was shorter in the prednisone group ( 30 days , IQR 25-34 ) than in the placebo group ( 44 days , 40-50 ; hazard ratio [ HR ] 133 , 95 % CI 115-150 , p < 00001 ) .",3
Pneumonia-associated complications until day 30 did not differ between groups ( 11 [ 3 % ] in the prednisone group and 22 [ 6 % ] in the placebo group ; odds ratio [ OR ] 049 [ 95 % CI 023-102 ] ; p = 0056 ) .,3
"The prednisone group had a higher incidence of in-hospital hyperglycaemia needing insulin treatment ( 76 [ 19 % ] vs 43 [ 11 % ] ; OR 196 , 95 % CI 131-293 , p = 00010 ) .",3
Other adverse events compatible with corticosteroid use were rare and similar in both groups .,3
Prednisone treatment for 7 days in patients with community-acquired pneumonia admitted to hospital shortens time to clinical stability without an increase in complications .,4
This finding is relevant from a patient perspective and an important determinant of hospital costs and efficiency .,4
"The treated subjects experienced significantly improved skin complexion and skin feeling , profilometrically assessed skin roughness , and ultrasonographically measured collagen density .",3
The blinded clinical evaluation of photographs confirmed significant improvement in the intervention groups compared with the control .,3
Broadband polychromatic PBM showed no advantage over the red-light-only spectrum .,4
"However , both novel light sources that have not been previously used for PBM have demonstrated efficacy and safety for skin rejuvenation and intradermal collagen increase when compared with controls .",4
"Of 625 tumor cases examined , 70 ( 11.2 % ) exhibited contraction at the T11 tract in one or both MRE11 alleles and were thus predicted to be deficient in MRE11 ( dMRE11 ) .",3
"In pooled treatment analyses , dMRE11 patients showed initially reduced DFS and OS but improved long-term DFS and OS compared with patients with an intact MRE11 T11 tract .",3
"In the subgroup of dMRE11 patients treated with IFL , an unexplained early increase in mortality but better long-term DFS than IFL-treated pMRE11 patients was observed .",3
Analysis of this relatively small number of patients and events showed that the dMRE11 marker predicts better prognosis independent of treatment in the long-term .,4
"In subgroup analyses , dMRE11 patients treated with irinotecan exhibited unexplained short-term mortality .",4
"MRE11 status is readily assayed and may therefore prove to be a useful prognostic marker , provided that the results reported here for a relatively small number of patients can be generalized in independent analyses of larger numbers of samples .",4
"Of the 40,142 eligible patients who had acute symptomatic VTE , 371 underwent filter placement because of known significant bleeding risk .",3
A total of 344 patients treated with a filter were matched with 344 patients treated without a filter .,3
Propensity score-matched pairs showed a nonsignificant trend toward lower risk of all-cause death for filter insertion compared with no insertion ( 6.6 % vs. 10.2 % ; p = 0.12 ) .,3
The risk-adjusted PE-related mortality rate was lower for filter insertion than no insertion ( 1.7 % vs. 4.9 % ; p = 0.03 ) .,3
Risk-adjusted recurrent VTE rates were higher for filter insertion than for no insertion ( 6.1 % vs. 0.6 % ; p < 0.001 ) .,3
"In patients presenting with VTE and with a significant bleeding risk , inferior vena cava filter insertion compared with anticoagulant therapy was associated with a lower risk of PE-related death and a higher risk of recurrent VTE .",4
"However , study design limitations do not imply a causal relationship between filter insertion and outcome .",4
"In total , 57 393 consecutive asymptomatic Korean individuals aged 30 to 80 years without a prior history of cardiovascular disease who underwent a general health examination were enrolled .",3
Subjects were randomly classified into the train ( n = 45 914 ) and validation ( n = 11 479 ) cohorts .,3
Thirty-one possible risk factors were assessed .,3
"The cardiovascular event was a composite of cardiovascular death , myocardial infarction , and stroke .",3
"In the train cohort , the C-index ( 95 % confidence interval ) and Akaike Information Criterion were used to develop the best-fitting prediction model .",3
"In the validation cohort , the predicted versus the observed cardiovascular event rates were compared by the C-index and Nam and D'Agostino ( 2 ) statistics .",3
"During a median follow-up period of 3.1 ( interquartile range , 1.9-4 .3 ) years , 458 subjects had 474 cardiovascular events .",3
"In the train cohort , the best-fitting model consisted of age , diabetes mellitus , hypertension , current smoking , family history of coronary heart disease , white blood cell , creatinine , glycohemoglobin , atrial fibrillation , blood pressure , and cholesterol ( C-index = 0.757 [ 0.726-0 .788 ] and Akaike Information Criterion = 7207 ) .",3
"When this model was tested in the validation cohort , it performed well in terms of discrimination and calibration abilities ( C-index = 0.760 [ 0.693-0 .828 ] and Nam and D'Agostino ( 2 ) statistic = 0.001 for 3 years ; C-index = 0.782 [ 0.719-0 .846 ] and Nam and D'Agostino ( 2 ) statistic = 1.037 for 5 years ) .",3
A risk model based on traditional clinical and biomarkers has a feasible model performance in predicting cardiovascular events in an asymptomatic Korean population .,4
"The PaCO ( 2 ) ( mmHg , 1 mmHg = 0.133 kPa ) , oxygen index ( OI ) at 12-24 h , and FiO ( 2 ) at 24 h post-ventilation in BiPAP and SBiPAP groups were lower than that in NCPAP groups with significant difference ( 44 9 and 45 9 vs. 50 9 , 2.76 0.96 and 2.79 0.60 vs. 3.24 0.72 , 0.34 0.10 and 0.35 0.07 vs. 0.39 0.07 ; F = 4.456 , 5.146 and 4.123 ; P = 0.014 , 0.007 and 0.019 , respectively ) .",3
There was no significant difference between BiPAP and SBiPAP groups .,3
"There was no significant difference among three groups ( all P > 0.05 ) in the following events : respiratory index ( RI ) at 12-24 h post-ventilation , abdominal distension , period of non-invasive ventilation , ratio of intubation for invasive ventilation if failed noninvasive ventilation , air-leak syndrome , neonatal necrotizing enterocolitis , periventricular-intraventricular haemorrhage , bronchopulmonary dysplasia , retinopathy of prematurity , mortality rate after 36 h of age or rate of abandon for discharge .",3
"The independent risk factors for failure of non-invasive positive pressure ventilation were gender , gestational age , antepartum steroid at 24 h before birth to 7 d , and birth weight , with the OR ( 95 % confidence interval ) being 14.120 ( 1.135 , 175.662 ) , 2.862 ( 1.479 , 5.535 ) , 61.084 ( 3.115 , 1 198.031 ) , and 8.306 ( 1.488 , 46.383 ) , respectively .",3
"As the primary mode of ventilation in premature infants with RDS , both BiPAP and SBiPAP are more beneficial than NCPAP in improving oxygenation and reducing CO ( 2 ) retention without increasing the incidence of adverse events .",4
"Principal factor analysis ( PFA ) , iterative PFA , and maximum likelihood suggested retrieving 3 factors : Peace , Meaning , and Faith .",3
"Both Peace and Meaning positively related to QOL , whereas only Peace uniquely contributed to QOL .",3
This study supported the 3-factor model of the FACIT-Sp-12 .,4
Suggestions for revision of items and further validation of the identified factor pattern were provided .,4
"Compared with the health and wellness arm , the exercise arm had significantly greater increases in sports or exercise activity ( 0.3 vs 5.3 metabolic equivalent of task [ MET ] hours/week ; P < .001 ) , and smaller declines in total activity ( -42.7 vs -2.1 MET hours/week ; P = .02 ) and activities of moderate to vigorous intensity ( -30.6 vs -10.6 MET hours/week ; P = .05 ) , and was more likely to achieve recommended guidelines for physical activity ( odds ratio = 2.12 ; 95 % confidence interval = 1.45 , 3.10 ) .",3
These findings extend the previous literature by demonstrating the benefits of a clinically feasible exercise intervention in an ethnically and socio-economically diverse population .,4
"Given the increased risk of adverse maternal health outcomes in ethnic minority groups , these findings may have important implications for reducing health disparities .",4
Plasma selenium concentrations increased significantly and dose-dependently in treatment groups receiving selenium ( P < 0.001 ) .,3
"Serum TSH and FT4 concentrations decreased significantly and dose-dependently by 0.066 mIU/l ( P = 0.010 ) and 0.11 pmol/l ( P = 0.015 ) , respectively , per 100g/day increase , with insignificant differences between 6 months and 5 years .",3
No significant effects were found for FT3 and FT3 : FT4 ratio .,3
"In euthyroid subjects , selenium supplementation minutely and dose-dependently affects thyroid function , when compared with placebo , by decreasing serum TSH and FT4 concentrations .",4
"Based on these findings , selenium supplementation is not warranted under conditions of marginal selenium deficiency .",4
"However , a role for selenium supplementation in the treatment of autoimmune thyroid diseases is still unresolved .",4
"Patients in both repaglinide and metformin groups achieved significant reductions in HbA1c ( -1.8 1.5 vs -1.6 1.5 % ) , FPG ( fasting blood glucose ) ( -1.7 1.7 vs -2.1 1.7 mmol/l ) and 2-hPPG ( post-prandial glucose ) ( -3.8 3.1 vs -3.8 3.6 mmol/l ) , with no statistical differences between the groups .",3
"Glycaemic variability , glucose infusion rate and - cell function were all significantly improved from baseline in the two groups ( all P < 0.05 ) , without any statistical differences in the improvement between the groups .",3
"Repaglinide and metformin achieved comparable efficacy in improving glycaemic control , reducing glycaemic variability , enhancing insulin sensitivity and ameliorating - cell function .",4
"Therefore , repaglinide is an optional agent for initial therapy in Chinese patients with newly diagnosed T2DM .",4
Overall colon cleanliness was adequate in 94 % ( CI 91-97 ) of patients in group I versus 80 % ( CI 72-88 ) in group II ( P = 0.27 ) .,3
No significant differences were observed in the per-segment quality of colon cleansing between the two groups .,3
CCE reached the rectum in 80 % ( CI 73-87 ) of patients in group I versus 75 % ( CI 67-83 ) in group II ( p = 0.59 ) .,3
The quality of colon cleanliness achieved with one-day bowel preparation is equivalent to that of the standard two-day schedule in patients undergoing CCE .,4
( 1 ) The total effective rate was 91.9 % ( 34/37 ) in the catgutembedding group and was 86.2 % ( 25/29 ) in the western medication group .,3
The efficacy in the catgutembedding group was better than that in the western medication group ( P < 0.05 ) .,3
"( 2 ) The symptom score of TCM was all reduced significantly after treatment in the two groups ( both P < 0.01 ) , and the result in the catgut embedding group was superior to the western medication group ( 6.42 + / -2.81 vs 10.99 + / -3.11 , P < 0.01 ) .",3
"( 3 ) Lecithin body number was increased apparently in the two groups after treatment ( both P < 0.01 ) , and the result in the catgut-embedding group was superior to the western medicine group ( 33.56 + / -5.88 vs 29.78 + / -7.06 , P < 0.05 ) .",3
"( 4 ) Total score of NIH-CPSI , score of pain , score of SAS and score of SDS were all improved apparently after treatment in the two groups ( all P < 0.01 ) , and the results in the catgut embedding group were superior to the western medication group ( P < 0.01 , P < 0.05 ) .",3
The acupoint catgut embedding therapy achieves the superior efficacy on chronic pelvic pain syndrome of damp-heat stagnation pattern as compared with conventional western medicine .,4
"This therapy relieves clinical symptoms , improves the states of anxiety and depression and increases lecithin body number obviously .",4
"Significant improvements in symptoms of anxiety and depression were observed over time in both the TEG and TG ( Fs > 69 , ps < .001 ) these were sustained from post-treatment to 12-month follow-up ( ps > .05 ) , and were associated with large effect sizes .",3
"No statistically significant differences in symptoms were found between the TEG and TG at post-treatment , 3-month or 12-month follow-up .",3
Previously reported symptom differences between TEG and TG participants with comorbid symptoms were no longer present at 12-month follow-up ( ps > .70 ) .,3
The overall benefits of the Wellbeing Course were sustained at 12-month follow-up .,4
"Although automated emails facilitated Course completion and reductions in symptoms for participants with comorbid anxiety and depression from pre-post treatment , these differences were no longer observed at 12-month follow-up .",4
"The results indicate that automated emails promote more rapid treatment response for people with elevated and comorbid symptoms , but may not improve longer term outcomes .",4
The test for homogeneity of intervention effects on hospital-based maternal mortality among the two delivery mode subgroups was statistically significant ( p-value : 0.0201 ) .,3
"Compared to the control , the adjusted OR of maternal mortality was 0.71 ( 95 % CI : 0.58-0 .82 , p = 0.0034 ) among women with cesarean delivery .",3
"The intervention had no significant effect among women with vaginal delivery ( adjusted OR 0.87 , 95 % CI 0.69-1 .11 , p = 0.6213 ) .",3
This differential effect was particularly marked for district hospitals .,3
Maternal deaths reviews and on-site training on emergency obstetric care may be more effective in reducing maternal mortality among high-risk women who need a cesarean section than among low-risk women with vaginal delivery .,4
The achieving of expected outcomes by the PNLT through implementation of DOTS requires several challenges .,4
"Although it has been demonstrated that the DOTS strategy is effective in the fight against tuberculosis , its application remains difficult in developing countries .",4
This study explores the potential of mHealth to support DOTS strategy .,4
"It will gather new evidence on the effectiveness of mHealth-based interventions and SMS reminders in the improvement of treatment adherence and the cure rate of tuberculosis patients , especially in a low-resource country such as Cameroon .",4
"Analysed by Mann-Whitney U-tests , Stepwise Protocol of Treating Pain conferred significant benefit in treatment of the NPI-NH mood cluster ( F = 13.4 , df = 1 ; 299 , p < 0.001 ) and depression ( F = 2.0 , df = 1 ; 301 , p = 0.025 ) .",3
"Further analyses highlighted improvements in apathy ( F = 5.3 , df = 1 ; 300 , p = 0.017 ) , night-time behaviours ( F = 3.1 , df = 1 ; 301 , p = 0.050 ) , and appetite items ( F = 11.6 , df = 1 ; 301 , p = 0.005 ) , but not irritability ( p = 0.092 ) and anxiety ( p = 0.125 ) .",3
"Mood symptoms including depression significantly improved with pain treatment , emphasizing the importance of more rigorous treatment of pain in agitated people with dementia .",4
Findings have potentially immediate clinical relevance .,4
"Besides significant improvements for the trained phoneme-identification task , a generalized training effect was noted via significantly improved sentence recognition in moderate noise .",3
No significant changes were noted in the difficult noise conditions .,3
Improved performance was maintained over an extended period .,3
Phoneme-discrimination training improves experienced CI listeners ' speech perception in noise .,4
Additional research is needed to optimize auditory training for individual benefit .,4
All participants indicated that they believed they were fully informed when providing written consent to participate in the trial .,3
Participants ' perceived it was acceptable to employ a sham intervention within the trial of acupressure wristbands without informing potential participants that they may receive a sham treatment .,3
Despite the fact that participants were not informed that one of the treatment arms was a sham intervention the majority indicated they assumed one of the treatment arms would be placebo .,3
Many trials of acupuncture and acupressure do not inform participants they may receive a sham intervention .,4
The current study indicates patients ' perceive this approach to the consent process as acceptable .,4
"However , the fact participants assume one treatment may be placebo threatens the methodological basis for utilising this approach to the consent process .",4
This will be the first randomized controlled trial of a specific intervention in patients with BD and comorbid BPD or borderline personality features .,4
There are no recommendations in the guideline of treatment of bipolar disorders for patients with this complex comorbidity .,4
We expect that a combined treatment aimed at mood disorder and emotion regulation will improve treatment outcomes for these patients .,4
"While the under-O-glycosylated IgA1 levels in IgAN patients were significantly higher than those in healthy controls when measured ( p < 0.05 ) , there was no significant difference in under-O-glycosylated pIgA1 .",3
"There was neither a correlation observed between the data from HAA-ELISA and pIgA1 trap ( r2 = 0.09 ) in the IgAN patients ( r2 = 0.005 ) nor was there a linear correlation between Area-IgA and data from HAA-ELISA or the pIgA1 trap ( r2 = 0.005 , 0.03 , respectively ) .",3
"Contour plots of clinical parameters versus data from HAA-ELISA and the pIgA1 trap revealed that patients with a high score in each clinical parameter concentrated in specific areas , showing that patients with specific O-glycan profiles of IgA1 have similar clinical parameters .",3
"A decision tree analysis suggested that dominant immune complexes in glomeruli were consisted of : 1 ) IgA1-IgG and complements , 2 ) pIgA1 and complements , and 3 ) monomeric IgA1-IgA or aggregated monomeric IgA1 .",3
Serum under-O-glycosylated IgA1 levels are not correlated with glomerular IgA deposition based upon heterogeneity in the composition of glomerular immune complexes in IgAN patients .,4
"A total of 66 patients ( 38 in group F , 28 in group T ) were included in the efficacy analysis population .",3
"The Lanza score changed as follows : in group F , it improved significantly , from 0.891.03 ( meanstandard deviation ) before medication to 0.390.75 after medication ( P = 0.006 ) ; in group T , no significant difference was observed : 0.750.93 before medication and 0.680.82 after medication .",3
Famotidine is better than teprenone in terms of reducing the number of the erosions under use of LDA .,4
Postprocedural CK-MB and TnI in the CP group were significantly increased compared to the control group .,3
"In the CP group , 8.0 % and 5.0 % of patients had an increase in CK-MB 1 to 3 times and > 3 times , respectively , which were significantly lower than that of the control group ( 19.0 % and 9.0 % , respectively ) ; 12.0 % and 10.0 % of patients had an increase in TnI 1 to 3 times and > 3 times , respectively , which were significantly lower than that of the control group ( 21.0 % and 18.0 % , respectively ) .",3
Exogenous CP was helpful to reduce myocardial injury after PCI .,4
"A total of 240 symptomatic plaques were included and divided into 3 groups : 80 in group A ( atorvastatin 80 mg ) , 80 in group B ( atorvastatin 40 mg ) , and 80 to group C ( no atorvastatin ) .",3
"GSM score increases significantly more extensive in group A than in group B ( +48.65 vs. +39.46 , P < .02 ) and group C ( +48.65 vs. 19.3 , P = .0002 ) .",3
"An inverse association between reduction of low-density lipoprotein and the increase in the GSM score ( r = -.456 , P = .007 ) has been observed .",3
"Moreover , the reduction of high-sensitive C-reactive protein correlates inversely with the increase of the GSM ( r = -.398 , P = .021 ) .",3
Dose-dependent effect of atorvastatin on symptomatic carotid plaque morphology may suggest a specific role of this drug in the atherosclerotic stroke prevention .,4
"Four factors emerged , which differed from the two subscales that are typically used .",3
The four-factor version predicted cessation ; the two-factor version did not .,3
Identifying the types of social support that predict smoking cessation depend on our ability to measure social support .,4
More nuanced measures will likely clarify the role of social support in cessation .,4
The treatment group demonstrated significantly superior performance on 1 of 2 measures of inference generation in reading and 1 measure of metacognitive ability compared with the control group .,3
Significant differences between groups were not found on measures of reading comprehension or social inference ability .,3
"These findings suggest that the ACT & Check Strategy was effective in improving participants ' ability to generate inferences in reading and certain metacognitive abilities , but the skills do not appear to generalize to other social communication contexts , such as social inference generation .",4
This research provides a measure of support for explicitly teaching inference generation to address a reading inference deficit in adults with HF-ASD .,4
"Median subject age was 52 years , body mass index was 28.4 kg/m ( 2 ) and DCCT/EDIC time-weighted hemoglobin A1c was 7.9 % .",3

Prostate specific antigen increased significantly with age ( p < 0.0001 ) and with lower time-weighted hemoglobin A1c ( p < 0.0001 ) .,3
Each 10 % increase in hemoglobin A1c was accompanied by an 11 % reduction in prostate specific antigen ( p = 0.0001 ) .,3
Prostate specific antigen decreases as hemoglobin A1c increases in men with type 1 diabetes mellitus .,4
"This relationship is independent of age , body mass index , androgen levels , medication use and measures of diabetes severity , which suggests that factors related to glycemia may directly affect prostate specific antigen levels .",4
"Accommodative ability evaluated by NPA and OQAS , OPI , and total ocular symptom scores changed significantly after 3D viewing ( p = 0.005 , 0.003 , 0.006 , and 0.003 , respectively ) , but yielded no difference after 2D viewing .",3
The objective measurement by OQAS verified the decrease of accommodative ability while viewing 3D displays .,3
"The change of NPA , OPI , and total ocular symptom scores after 3D viewing had a significant correlation ( p < 0.05 ) , implying direct associations among these factors .",3
The decrease of accommodative ability after 3D viewing was validated by both subjective and objective methods in our study .,4
"Further , the deterioration of accommodative ability and ocular surface stability may be causative factors of visual asthenopia in individuals viewing 3D displays .",4
"Serum-25 ( OH ) vitamin D and serum-1 ,25 ( OH ) vitamin D increased significantly after 12 weeks in the intervention group ( p = 0.01 , p = 0.004 ) .",3
Serum-25 ( OH ) vitamin D was also significantly higher in the vitamin D group compared to the placebo group ( p = 0.02 ) after intervention .,3
"Although no significant changes in insulin sensitivity , inflammation , blood pressure , lipid profile , or HbA1c were found , we observed borderline ( p between 0.05 and 0.10 ) improvements of insulin secretion , in terms of c-peptide levels , first phase incremental AUC insulin and insulin secretory burst mass .",3
"Improvement in vitamin D status does not improve insulin resistance , blood pressure , inflammation or HbA1c , but might increase insulin secretion in patients with established type 2 diabetes .",4
"Lactate , hematocrit , and Bone ALP significantly increased ( p < 0.05 ) IP for both protocols .",3
Bone resorption markers did not change during RE only .,3
CTX-I significantly decreased POST WBV .,3
"TRAP5b increased POST WBV , then significantly decreased at 30P .",3
"Generally , BTM changes to RE only were not significant when adjusted for hemoconcentration .",4
The WBV stimulus altered bone resorption marker but not bone formation marker responses .,4
The results of the ForaC study will provide surgical treatment recommendations for spondylotic foraminal stenosis and will contribute to the understanding of its short - and long-term clinical and radiological postoperative course .,4
"This will hopefully translate into improvements in surgical treatment and thus , clinical practice for spondylotic foraminal stenosis .",4
( a ) Qualitative analysis results : strength derived from the five-element group music therapy and emotional adjustment .,3
The five-element group music therapy can reduce patients ' psychological distress and let them feel inner peace and enhance their life satisfaction .,3
( b ) No significant difference in SDS and HAMD scores was found between the two groups ( P > 0.05 ) prior to treatment .,3
"After treatment , the mean SDS score of the control group was 49.9 + / - 18.8 , while the treatment group 's score was 40.2 + / - 18.1 .",3
"The HAMD score of the control group was 11.2 + / -3.1 , and the treatment group 's score was 8.8 + / - 4.9 .",3
"Following 8 weeks of music therapy , the SDS and HAMD scores of the treatment group were significantly lower than those for the control group ( P < 0.05 ) .",3
Five-element music therapy alleviated the symptoms of seasonal affective disorder in the elderly patients .,4
Eleven patients were included in each group without any exclusion from the study .,3
"The cervical vertebral angle changes pre - and post-intubation with the MGL was less than with the Macintosh laryngoscope at C3/4 ( 2.00 vs. 4.27 degrees , respectively ; p-value = 0.034 ) and the cumulative changes of all cervical spine levels ( 9.18 vs. 17.18 degrees , respectively ; p-value = 0.017 ) .",3
"However , the time to intubation with the MGL was longer ( 35.07 vs. 23.21 seconds , p-value = 0.004 ) , the laryngoscope view was better .",3
"There were no statistically significant differences in the intubation success rate , the number of attempts , and the incidence of complications .",3
"Orotracheal intubation with MGL provided less cervical spine motion and improved visualization of the vocal cords , without causing adverse consequences as compared with Macintosh laryngoscope and MILS .",4
We found no differences in levels of inflammatory/procoagulant markers or in the proportion of patients with plasma residual viremia detection by treatment group .,3
The long-term treatment with protease inhibitor monotherapy in the setting of routine clinical practice is not associated with a higher prevalence of plasma residual viremia or more elevated inflammatory/procoagulant markers levels than triple drug therapy .,4
"Over the 2 wk , subjects lost , on average , 2.41 and 2.27 kg with consumption of the Soy - and Meat-HPWL diets , respectively [ P = 0.352 ; SE of the difference ( SED ) : 0.1 ] .",3
"ANOVA confirmed that subjectively rated hunger ( P = 0.569 ; SED : 3.8 ) , fullness ( P = 0.404 ; SED : 4.1 ) , desire to eat ( P = 0.356 ; SED : 3.7 ) , preservation of lean body mass ( P = 0.334 ; SED : 0.2 ) , and loss of percentage fat mass ( P = 0.179 ; SED : 0.2 ) did not differ between the 2 HPWL diets .",3
"There were differences in absolute concentrations of ghrelin and peptide YY between the 2 HPWL diets , although the response as net area under the curve was not different .",3
Appetite control and weight loss were similar for both HPWL diets .,4
"Gut hormone profile was similar between the diets , which suggests that vegetarian diets can be as effective as meat-based diets for appetite control during weight loss .",4
There was no statistically significant difference in terms of AO formation ( P > 0.05 ) between the extraction sites .,3
"However , the postoperative pain in ABS administration sites was higher than in the other sites for the first 2 days after surgery ( P < 0.05 ) .",3
The results showed that ABS administration did not increase the incidence of AO formation .,4
"Thus , ABS can be used safely for hemostasis after impacted mandibular third molar surgery .",4
There was no significant difference between peak power output and mean power output between trials ( p > 0.05 ) .,3
"Compared with PLA , CAF+CHO resulted in a 5.2 % reduction in total work , corresponding to a 24.7-25 .7 % increase in fatigue at the end stage of the HIS .",3
"The administration of CAF+CHO supplementation also resulted in an 11.1 % increase in blood lactate , and elevated blood glucose concentrations throughout HIS testing compared with PLA ( p < 0.05 ) .",3
"Cortisol concentrations also increased with CAF+CHO intake compared with PLA ; however , there was no significant effect of CAF+CHO supplementation on testosterone concentrations .",3
Co-ingestion of CAF and CHO did not improve high-intensity sprint cycling performance or reduce fatigue in active males .,4
"Moreover , combined CAF and CHO supplementation might facilitate catabolism during prolonged high-intensity intermittent exercise .",4
"Morphine requirement showed no statistical difference during the initial 12 hours ( all P 0.68 at PACU , 6 and 12 hours ) .",3
"However , at 24 hours those patients randomized to receive the TAPB required less cumulative morphine than the caudal group ( 0.05 mg/kg 0.06 vs 0.09 mg/kg 0.07 , P = 0.03 ) .",3
"There was a trend toward fewer episodes of emesis in the TAPB group which reached statistical significance at 18 and 24 hours ( 6 vs 1 episodes , P = 0.03 ; and 9 vs 2 episodes , P = 0.02 ) .",3
"Pain scores ( 0-10 ) were higher in the TAPB group in the PACU ( 3.46 2.69 vs 1.71 2.1 , P = 0.02 ) , but there were no significant differences at all subsequent time points ( all P 0.10 ) .",3
"The TAPB group also had a higher requirement for the bladder antispasmodic oxybutynin at 24 hours ( 0.49 0.58 vs 0.28 0.17 , P = 0.003 ) .",3
"TAPB provided superior analgesia compared with the caudal block at 6 to 24 hours after block placement , as demonstrated by a statistically significant decrease in cumulative opioid requirement , which was the primary end point .",4
The lower incidence of emesis in the TAPB group likely reflected the decreased opioid consumption .,4
"Although TAPB appears to be less effective than the caudal block in preventing viscerally mediated bladder spasms , as evidenced by the higher PACU pain scores and increased oxybutynin requirement at 24 hours , this effect may be counteracted in future clinical practice by scheduled administration of the antispasmodic medications .",4
"Considering the overall safety advantages of the TAPB over the caudal block , this should be considered a preferred regional technique for lower abdominal surgeries .",4
"In a double-blind crossover trial , 80 patients with rheumatoid arthritis ( 60 with CAD and 20 without ) were randomized to a single injection of anakinra or placebo and after 48 hours to the alternative treatment .",3
"At baseline and 3 hours after treatment , we assessed ( 1 ) flow-mediated dilation of brachial artery ; ( 2 ) coronary flow reserve , ejection fraction , systemic arterial compliance , and resistance by echocardiography ; ( 3 ) left ventricular global longitudinal and circumferential strain , peak twisting , untwisting velocity by speckle tracking ; and ( 4 ) interleukin-1 , nitrotyrosine , malondialdehyde , protein carbonyl , and Fas/Fas ligand levels .",3
"At baseline , patients with CAD had 3-fold higher interleukin-1 , protein carbonyl , higher nitrotyrosine , malondialdehyde , and Fas/Fas ligand than non-CAD ( P < 0.05 ) .",3
"After anakinra , there was a greater improvement of flow-mediated dilation ( 574 % versus 475 % ) , coronary flow reserve ( 374 % versus 292 % ) , arterial compliance ( 2018 % versus 217 % ) , resistance ( -1119 % versus 921 % ) , longitudinal strain ( 335 % versus 182 % ) , circumferential strain ( 225 % versus 135 % ) , peak twisting ( 305 % versus 125 % ) , untwisting velocity ( 235 % versus 135 % ) , ejection fraction ( 125 % versus 0.55 % ) , apoptotic and oxidative markers , and , in particular , of protein carbonyl ( 3520 % versus 149 % ) in CAD than in non-CAD patients ( P < 0.01 ) .",3
No changes in the examined markers were observed after placebo .,3
"Interleukin-1 inhibition causes a greater improvement in endothelial , coronary aortic function in addition to left ventricular myocardial deformation and twisting in rheumatoid arthritis patients with CAD than in those without .",4
"Results were obtained from 478 patients ( 82 % ) , with a median follow up of 14 years .",3
"PRT+TME patients without stoma reported more faecal leakage and higher stool frequency , resulting in increased need of pads .",3
"Furthermore , irradiated males reported more erection problems .",3
"However , radiotherapy did not have negative effects on overall functioning .",3
"Compared with Dutch population , patients in both treatment arms reported a small decrease in overall functioning and males reported less sexual activity , interest and enjoyment and more erection difficulties .",3
Irradiated females reported more vaginal dryness and more pain at intercourse compared with Dutch population .,3
Long-term HRQL evaluation shows that treatment-related symptoms are still present 14 years after treatment for rectal cancer .,4
Radiotherapy increased bowel dysfunction in patients without stoma .,4
"Compared with the Dutch population , both groups reported increased sexual dysfunction .",4
"Despite these treatment-related symptoms , there was no difference in overall functioning and global health between TME and PRT+TME .",4
"Forty-two patients with a first-time STEMI , successfully revascularized by primary percutaneous coronary intervention ( pPCI ) had serum samples taken prior to pPCI , 2 , 7 days , 2 months , and 1 year following STEMI for the analysis of the markers of collagen synthesis , and collagen degradation .",3
"Late enhancement and cine CMR was performed on Days 2 , 7 , 2 months , and 1-year post-STEMI .",3
There was a significant increase in type I collagen degradation following STEMI that was not accompanied by an increase in collagen type I synthesis until 2 months and 1 year .,3
"In contrast to the delay in type I collagen synthesis , there was an immediate increase in type III collagen synthesis that was sustained for 1 year .",3
N-terminal procollagen type I levels assessed prior to pPCI were predictive of adverse LV remodelling at all CMR time-points .,3
Our findings indicate a net type I collagen breakdown in the first week following STEMI compensated by an early increase in collagen type III synthesis .,4
"There is an increase in both type I and III collagen synthesis markers at 2 months and 1 year , indicating a persistent increase in collagen turnover even in these apparently successfully treated patients .",4
"At one month , symptoms reappeared for 12 patients in the steroid group and 7 in the arthroscopy respectively .",3
"Gender and age did not correlate with treatment , whereas extrusion of the meniscus , bone marrow edema , duration of the clinical symptoms , obesity and a low preoperative score were negative prognostic factors .",3
"Degenerative medial meniscal tears , in the presence of osteoarthritis , can only marginally benefit from arthroscopic debridement over intraarticular steroid injections in short term follow up .",4
"When considering individual cases , factors become more predictive when analyzed in group .",4
A total of 159 participants from 10 centers were included : 81 in the WBV plus exercise group and 78 in the control group .,3
"Mean age was 82 years , and 67.29 % were women .",3
The Tinetti test score showed a significant overall improvement in both groups ( P < .001 ) .,3
No significant differences were found between groups at week 6 ( P = .890 ) or month 6 ( P = .718 ) .,3
"The Timed Up and Go test did not improve ( P = .599 ) in either group over time , and no significant differences were found between groups at week 6 ( P = .757 ) or month 6 ( P = .959 ) .",3
"Muscle performance results from the 5 Sit-To-Stand tests improved significantly across time ( P = .001 ) , but no statistically significant differences were found between groups at week 6 ( P = .709 ) or month 6 ( P = .841 ) .",3
"A total of 57 falls ( 35.8 % ) were recorded during the follow-up period , with no differences between groups ( P = .406 ) .",3
"Exercise program on a vibratory platform provides benefits similar to those with exercise program on a stationary surface in relation to body balance , gait , functional mobility , and muscle strength in institutionalized elderly people .",4
Longer studies in larger samples are needed to assess falls .,4
A total of 231 employees were randomized to either the intervention group ( n = 116 ) or CAU ( n = 115 ) .,3
The posttreatment assessment was completed by 171 ( 74.0 % ) participants .,3
"Both the intervention and the CAU group showed significant improvements in the primary outcome of depressive symptoms , but no differences between the conditions was found ( d = 0.16 , 95 % CI -0.10 to 0.41 , P = .29 ) .",3
"Significant but small effects in favor of the intervention group were found for anxiety symptoms ( d = 0.16 , 95 % CI -0.09 to 0.42 , P = .04 ) and exhaustion ( d = 0.17 , 95 % CI -0.09 to 0.43 , P = .02 ) .",3
This study showed that a Web-based guided self-help course for employees with depressive symptoms was not more effective in reducing depressive symptoms among employees than CAU .,4
Large improvements in depressive symptoms in the CAU group were unforeseen and potential explanations are discussed .,4
Our results show the rapid restoration of proliferative HCV-specific CD8 + T cells in the majority of patients with SVR12 within 4 weeks of therapy suggesting that IFN-free therapy mediated antigen removal may restore CD8 + T cell function .,3
This study indicates a specific restoration of proliferative HCV-specific CD8 + T cells under IFN-free therapy .,4
This is in contrast to PegIFN-based therapies that have been shown not to restore T cell function during and after chronic infection .,4
"At baseline , subjects were 589 ( SD ) years , 70 % female , with a BMI of 344kg/m ( 2 ) .",3
One-year weight loss ( % ) was 7.86.0 % for LWL and 1.74.5 % for UC .,3
"Group differences at 1-year were noted ( adjusted means [ 95 % CI ] for UC and LWL , respectively ) for adiponectin ( 8526.3 [ 7397.7 , 9827 ] ; 10,870.9 [ 9432.0 , 12,529.3 ] ng/ml ; p = 0.02 ) , leptin ( 30.4 [ 26.1 , 35.4 ] ; 23.7 [ 20.3 , 27.5 ] ng/ml ; p = 0.02 ) , IL-6 ( 0.4 [ 0.3 , 0.5 ] ; 0.2 [ 0.1 , 0.2 ] pg/ml ; p = 0.001 ) , and PAI-1 ( 50 [ 42.7 , 58.7 ] ; 36.2 [ 30.8 , 42.4 ] pg/ml ; p = 0.01 ) .",3
No differences in baseline ATGMCVR were seen between subjects with and without MetS .,3
These findings suggest ATGMCVR can be improved with weight loss ; larger studies are needed to determine if improvements in metabolic dysfunction are related to changes in ATGMCVR .,4
"Incorporation of 1.5 to 6 g of - glucan into snack bars had no additional glucose-lowering benefits irrespective of dose and source compared to the control bars ( 0 g - glucan ) , suggesting that both the solid food matrix and composition of the bars may play a role in their effects on glycemic response .",3
All bars reduced blood glucose area under the curve ( AUC ) by an average of 25 % ( p < 0.05 ) compared to the mean of the 3 white bread controls .,3
Adding - glucan from oats and barley to the snack bar formulation used in this study did not yield any additional benefits beyond the glucose-lowering effects of the snack bars themselves .,4
101 patients were successfully recruited and treated out of 221 suitable patients from a screened population of 393 .,3
"Patients in the simultaneous group ( n = 51 ) showed a significantly improved Venous Clinical Severity Score at all time points , 36 % of the delayed group required further treatment compared with 2 % of the simultaneous group ( P < 0.001 ) .",3
"There were no deep vein thromboses , with 1 superfificial venous thrombosis in each group .",3
"Combined endovenous ablation and phlebectomy delivers improved clinical outcomes and a reduced need for further procedures , as well as early quality of life improvements .",4
TC was noninferior to UC on all primary outcomes .,3
"At 2 weeks after pretest counseling , knowledge ( d = 0.03 ; lower bound of 97.5 % CI , -0.61 ) , perceived stress ( d = -0.12 ; upper bound of 97.5 % CI , 0.21 ) , and satisfaction ( d = -0.16 ; lower bound of 97.5 % CI , -0.70 ) had group differences and confidence intervals that did not cross their 1-point noninferiority limits .",3
"Decision conflict ( d = 1.1 ; upper bound of 97.5 % CI , 3.3 ) and cancer distress ( d = -1.6 ; upper bound of 97.5 % CI , 0.27 ) did not cross their 4-point noninferiority limit .",3
Results were comparable at 3 months .,3
"TC was not equivalent to UC on BRCA1/2 test uptake ( UC , 90.1 % ; TC , 84.2 % ) .",3
TC yielded cost savings of $ 114 per patient .,3
Genetic counseling can be effectively and efficiently delivered via telephone to increase access and decrease costs .,4
"% obesity increased in boys from both types of schools and in girls from control schools , while decreasing in girls from intervention schools ( all nonsignificant ) .",3
"% class time in MVA declined ( 24.5-16 .2 ) while remaining unchanged ( 24.8-23 .7 % ) in classes conducted by untrained and trained teachers , respectively .",3
"In boys , BMI Z declined ( 1.33-1 .24 ) and increased ( 1.22-1 .35 ) in intervention and control schools , respectively .",3
"In girls , BMI Z remained unchanged in intervention schools , while increasing significantly in control schools ( 0.91-1 .06 , P = 0.024 ) .",3
Interaction group time was significant for boys ( P < 0.0001 ) and girls ( P = 0.004 ) .,3
"This intervention was effective in controlling obesity , but not preventing it .",4
"Even though impact was small , results showed that when no intervention is implemented , obesity increases .",4
"Time to task completion was significantly shorter when using the 3-D vs the 2-D neuroendoscopy ( P = .001 ) , and accuracy of probe placement was significantly greater when using the HD vs the SD neuroendoscopy ( P = .009 ) .",3
"We found that 3-D endoscopy significantly improved perceived depth perception ( P < .001 ) , HD endoscopy significantly improved perceived image quality ( P < .001 ) , and both improved participants ' overall impression ( P < .001 ) .",3
"Three-dimensional neuroendoscopy and HD neuroendoscopy have differing but complementary effects on surgical performance , suggesting that neither alone can completely compensate for the lack of the other .",4
There is therefore strong preclinical evidence to justify 3-D HD neuroendoscopy .,4
"At month 36 , the difference between FAc 0.2 g/day and sham control in the percentage of patients who gained 15 letters or more was significantly greater in chronic DME patients ( FAc 0.2 g/day , 34.0 % vs. sham , 13.4 % ; P < 0.001 ) , compared with patients with nonchronic DME ( FAc 0.2 g/day , 22.3 % vs. sham , 27.8 % ; P = 0.275 ) .",3
"The greater response in patients with chronic DME was not associated with baseline ocular characteristics , changes in anatomic features , or differences in re-treatment or ancillary therapies .",3
The ocular adverse event profile for FAc 0.2 g/day was similar regardless of DME duration .,3
This is the first published analysis correlating duration of diagnosis of DME with treatment effect .,4
"In patients with chronic DME , FAc 0.2 g/day provides substantial visual benefit for up to 3 years and would provide an option for patients who do not respond to other therapy .",4
"In patients , PCON ( n = 49 ) in comparison with non-PCON ( n = 52 ) did not significantly reduce MVO ( 0 [ 0-1 .02 ] % vs. 0 [ 0-2 .1 ] % p = 0.2 ) or IS ( 18 13 % vs. 21 14 % , p = 0.2 ) .",3
"MVO ( > 1 segment in the 17-segment model ) occurred in 12/49 ( 25 % ) PCON and in 18/52 ( 35 % ) non-PCON patients , p = 0.3 .",3
"No significant differences were observed between PCON and non-PCON patients in left ventricular volumes , ejection fraction or the extent of hemorrhage .",3
"In the swine model , MVO occurred in 4/6 ( 67 % ) PCON and in 4/6 ( 67 % ) non-PCON pigs , p = 0.9 .",3
"The extent of MVO ( 10 7 % vs. 10 8 % , p = 0.9 ) and infarct size ( 23 14 % vs. 24 10 % , p = 0.8 ) was not reduced in PCON compared with non-PCON pigs .",3
Ischemic postconditioning does not significantly reduce microvascular obstruction in ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction .,4

Ketamine led to significantly greater acute mystical-type effects ( by HMS ) relative to the active control lorazepam ; ketamine 0.71 mg/kg was associated with significantly higher HMS scores than was the 0.41 mg/kg dose .,3
"HMS score , but not CADSS score , was found to mediate the effect of ketamine on motivation to quit cocaine 24h postinfusion .",3
These findings suggest that psychological mechanisms may be involved in some of the anti-addiction benefits resulting from ketamine .,4
Future research can evaluate whether the psychoactive effects of ketamine influence improvements in larger samples .,4
"Compared with the placebo-treated sides , topical glycopyrrolate-treated sides showed a reduction in the rate of sweat production at the forehead of 25.16 10.30 % ( mean SD ) at 90 min after the first application ( day 1 ) , 29.63 7.74 % at 24 h after the first application ( day 2 ) and 36.68 11.41 % at 24 h after eight additional successive daily applications ( day 10 ) ( all P < 0.025 ) .",3
"There was a little more decrease in HDSS score with the topical glycopyrrolate-treated half of the forehead , but the difference was not statistically significant ( P > 0.025 ) .",3
No serious adverse events were reported during the course of this study .,3
Only one patient developed a transient headache after treatment .,3
Topical glycopyrrolate application appears to be significantly effective and safe in reducing excessive facial perspiration .,4
"Baseline MMSE score was divided into four categories : 30 , 27-29 , 24-26 , and < 24 .",3
"The median MMSE score was 29 ( interquartile range 27-30 ) , and 726 ( 4.1 % ) has a MMSE score of less than 24 at baseline .",3
"After a mean follow-up of 4.5 years , 1,068 ( 6.1 % ) participants were drivers in a MVC .",3
"Lower scores were not associated with future MVCs ( MMSE score 29-27 , hazard ratio ( HR ) = 1.06 , 95 % confidence interval ( CI ) = 0.93-1 .22 ) ; MMSE score 26-24 , HR = 0.96 , 95 % CI = 0.78-1 .19 ; MMSE score < 24 , HR = 0.72 , 95 % CI = 0.50-1 .05 ) on multivariable analysis .",3
"A MVC within the previous 2 years ( HR = 2.68 , 95 % CI = 2.29-3 .13 ) was the strongest predictor of future MVCs .",3
"Other clinical factors associated with greater MVC risk were depression , falls within the previous year , sleep apnea , and lower baseline systolic blood pressure .",3
"In a population of frequent drivers , the MMSE does not predict MVCs .",4
Other clinical factors have a stronger association with MVC risk .,4
The two groups had no significant differences in the severity and duration of pain at baseline .,3
"After the intervention , however , the severity and duration of pain were significantly lower in the case group than in the control group ( P < 0.05 ) .",3
"Based on our findings , Boron supplementation can reduce the severity and duration of menstrual pain through exerting anti-inflammatory effects .",4
"In order to clarify the effects of Boron on dysmenorrhea , future studies are required to measure the levels of hormones and inflammatory biomarkers .",4
Regression analysis showed a strong negative association between childhood systolic BP and adult arteriolar diameter ( standardized regression coefficient [ ] -0.300 ; p < 0.001 ) and with change in systolic BP from childhood to adulthood ( = -0.249 ; p < 0.001 ) .,3
"For arteriolar tortuosity , there was a strong positive association between childhood systolic BP and adult arteriolar tortuosity ( = 0.154 ; p < 0.001 ) and no association with change in systolic BP from childhood to adulthood ( = 0.072 ; p = 0.110 ) .",3
High BP in childhood and increased BP from childhood to adulthood impacts on retinal microvascular architecture in mid-adulthood .,4
1156 patients of the overall cohort had pathologic Q-waves .,3
"The 90-day mortality and the composite of mortality , congestive heart failure ( CHF ) , or cardiogenic shock ( p < 0.001 for both outcomes ) rose as Q-wave width increased .",3
"After adapting a threshold 40ms for inferior and 20ms for lateral/apical MI in all patients ( n = 3065 ) with any measureable Q-wave we found hazard ratios ( HR ) for mortality ( HR : 2.44 , 95 % confidence interval ( CI ) ( 1.54-3 .85 ) , p < 0.001 ) and the composite ( HR : 2.32 , 95 % CI ( 1.70-3 .16 ) , p < 0.001 ) .",3
"This improved reclassification of patients experiencing the composite endpoint versus the conventional definition ( net reclassification index ( NRI ) : 0.23 , 95 % CI ( 0.09-0 .36 ) , p < 0.001 ) and universal MI definition ( NRI : 0.15 , 95 % CI ( 0.02-0 .29 ) , p = 0.027 ) .",3
The width of the baseline Q-wave in STEMI adds prognostic value in predicting 90-day clinical outcomes .,4
A threshold of 40ms in inferior and 20ms for lateral/apical MI enhances prognostic insight beyond current criteria .,4
"The number of days of albuterol use , the average number of albuterol actuations/day , and the highest number of albuterol actuations/day in the 1-week period were all positively associated with ACQ-5 score ( r = 0.41-0 .45 , P < .001 ) and had moderate discrimination for well-controlled and not well-controlled asthma ( ACQ-5 scores 0.75 and 1.5 , respectively ) , with receiver operator characteristic area under the curve of 0.80 to 0.82 and 0.70 to 0.77 , respectively .",3
"Cut points of 3 days of albuterol use , average albuterol use of 1 actuation/day , and highest albuterol use of 4 actuations/day in the 1-week period had 73 % sensitivity and 62 % specificity , 78 % sensitivity and 67 % specificity , and 78 % sensitivity and 66 % specificity , respectively , for predicting an ACQ-5 1.5 .",3
"Our findings support the use of the number of days of albuterol use , the average number of albuterol actuations per day , and the highest number of albuterol actuations per day over a 1-week period of observation as comparable markers of current asthma control .",4
Five patients discontinued the study ( three from the tenofovir group and two from the abacavir group ) .,3
No significant differences were detected between the groups at Week 48 ( P = 0.229 for total hip and P = 0.312 for lumbar spine ) .,3
"However , hip BMD improved by 2.1 % ( 95 % CI -0.6 to 4.7 ) ( P = 0.043 ) in the abacavir group and 0.7 % ( 95 % CI -0.9 to 2.4 ) ( P = 0.372 ) in the tenofovir group .",3
Lumbar spine BMD varied by -0.7 % ( 95 % CI -3.8 to 3.3 ) ( P 0.001 ) in the abacavir group and -1.2 % ( 95 % CI -3.8 to 0.4 ) ( P < 0.001 ) in the tenofovir group .,3
Switching from tenofovir to abacavir led to a slight improvement in femoral BMD although no differences were detected between groups .,4

Good inter-rater reliability is obtained for both click and 500 Hz TB ABR-BICs .,3
The most reliable peak in click ABR-BIC occurs at a mean latency of 6.06 ms ( SD 0.354 ms ) .,3
Reliable 500 Hz TB ABR-BIC are obtained with a mean latency of 9.47 ms ( SD 0.678 ms ) .,3
Amplitudes are larger for 500 Hz TB ABR-BIC than for clicks .,3
The most reliable peak in click ABR-BIC occurs at the downslope of wave V. Five hundred Hertz TB ABR-BIC is characterized by a broad positivity occurring at the level of wave V.,4
The ABR-BIC is a useful technique to investigate binaural interaction in certain populations .,4
"Examples are bilateral hearing aid users , bilateral cochlear implant users and bimodal listeners .",4
The latter refers to the combination of unilateral cochlear implantation and contralateral residual hearing .,4
The majority of these patients have residual hearing in the low frequencies .,4
The current study suggests that 500 Hz TB ABR-BIC may be a suitable technique to assess binaural interaction in this specific population of cochlear implant users .,4
"PPS decreased and changes in PPS after the intervention period were significantly associated with HR , PRP , body mass index ( BMI ) and visceral fat index ( all correlation coefficients > 0.2 , p < 0.05 ) .",3

A significant decline in the mean scores on the HSCL-25 was found for both groups although this was more pronounced for the intervention group .,3
There was no significant improvement in the MSPSS scores .,3
The small sample size of the final cohort affected the power of the study to detect significant differences between the intervention and control groups on the MSPSS .,4
Longer term impact of the intervention is unknown .,4

"Before treatment , baseline impedance in GERD patients was lower than in healthy controls ( p < 0.001 ) .",3
"Antireflux therapy increased baseline impedance ( from 1498 [ IQR 951-2472 ] to 2393 [ IQR 1353-3027 ] , p = 0.001 ) , however it only led to a partial recovery when compared to healthy controls ( 2393 [ IQR 1353-3027 ] vs 2983 [ 2335-3810 ] , p < 0.01 ) .",3
The effect of both treatment options was not significantly different ( p = 0.13 ) despite the increased number of non-acid reflux events in the PPI group .,3
No correlation was found between baseline impedance and GERD symptoms before or after treatment .,3
"Reduction in acid reflux by endoscopic fundoplication or PPI therapy leads to an increase in baseline impedance in GERD patients , likely to reflect recovery of mucosal integrity .",4
The impact of non-acid reflux events on esophageal mucosal integrity may be limited as no difference in the increase in baseline impedance was observed after both treatment options .,4
The lack of association between impedance baseline and heartburn severity indicates that other factors may contribute to heartburn perception in GERD .,4
"Fewer sprints ( NT = 13 5 vs PL = 15 6 , P = .005 , d = 0.41 ) and less total work ( NT = 49.2 24.2 kJ vs PL = 57.8 34.0 kJ , P = .027 , d = 0.3 ) were completed in NT relative to PL .",3
However there was no difference in overall mean power output or the mean power output for each individual 8-s sprint .,3
"These findings suggest that dietary nitrate is not beneficial for improving repeated-sprint performance , at least when such sprints are near-maximal and frequent in nature .",4
The lack of an effect of nitrate at near-maximal oxygen uptake supports the suggestion that at greater exercise intensities nitrate does not have an ergogenic effect .,4
"Mean baseline urine protein excretion was 1,045 , 1,084 , and 1,073 mg/d in the A manihot , losartan , and combined groups , respectively , and mean eGFR was 108 , 106 , and 106 mL/min/1 .73 m2 , respectively .",3

The rate of complications and revisions was significantly reduced in the FI Group .,3
"The full-endoscopic techniques brought advantages in the following areas : operation , complications , traumatization , rehabilitation .",3
Lack of placebo control group .,4
The recorded results demonstrate that the full-endoscopic interlaminar bilateral decompression adopting a unilateral approach provides an adequate and safe supplement and alternative to the conventional microsurgical bilateral laminotomy technique when the indication criteria are fulfilled .,4
"At the same time , it offers the advantages of a minimally invasive intervention .",4
"The DPE was successfully balanced across groups , as were baseline expectations .",3
"The principal finding was that the magnitude of the effects of DPE on LBP at 6 and 12 weeks ( | | total = 0.22 and 0.15 , p < .05 ) were comparable to the effects of dose of manipulation at those times ( | | total = 0.11 and 0.12 , p < .05 ) .",3
"In addition , baseline expectations had no notable effect on follow-up LBP .",3
"Subsequent expectations were affected by LBP , DPE , and dose ( p < .05 ) .",3
The DPE can have a relatively important effect on outcomes in open-label randomized trials of treatment efficacy .,4
"Therefore , attempts should be made to balance the DPE across treatment groups and report degree of success in study publications .",4
We balanced the DPE across groups with minimal training of treatment providers .,4
"Independent predictors for venous thromboembolism , proximal leg deep vein thrombosis , and pulmonary embolism developing during critical illness were assessed .",3
A total of 289 patients ( 7.7 % ) developed venous thromboembolism .,3
"Predictors of thromboprophylaxis failure as measured by development of venous thromboembolism included a personal or family history of venous thromboembolism ( hazard ratio , 1.64 ; 95 % CI , 1.03-2 .59 ; p = 0.04 ) and body mass index ( hazard ratio , 1.18 per 10-point increase ; 95 % CI , 1.04-1 .35 ; p = 0.01 ) .",3
"Increasing body mass index was also a predictor for developing proximal leg deep vein thrombosis ( hazard ratio , 1.25 ; 95 % CI , 1.06-1 .46 ; p = 0.007 ) , which occurred in 182 patients ( 4.9 % ) .",3
"Pulmonary embolism occurred in 47 patients ( 1.3 % ) and was associated with body mass index ( hazard ratio , 1.37 ; 95 % CI , 1.02-1 .83 ; p = 0.035 ) and vasopressor use ( hazard ratio , 1.84 ; 95 % CI , 1.01-3 .35 ; p = 0.046 ) .",3
"Low-molecular-weight heparin ( in comparison to unfractionated heparin ) thromboprophylaxis lowered pulmonary embolism risk ( hazard ratio , 0.51 ; 95 % CI , 0.27-0 .95 ; p = 0.034 ) while statin use in the preceding week lowered the risk of proximal leg deep vein thrombosis ( hazard ratio , 0.46 ; 95 % CI , 0.27-0 .77 ; p = 0.004 ) .",3
"Failure of standard thromboprophylaxis using low-molecular-weight heparin or unfractionated heparin is more likely in ICU patients with elevated body mass index , those with a personal or family history of venous thromboembolism , and those receiving vasopressors .",4

"Patients were enrolled at 4 sites if they had ischemic heart disease , an implantable cardioverter defibrillator ( ICD ) , and received 1 ICD shock or 3 antitachycardia pacing therapies for VT. .",3
Patients were randomized to 2 arms : ( 1 ) antiarrhythmic medication ( n = 14 ) and ( 2 ) catheter ablation ( n = 13 ) ; patients were followed at 3 and 6 months .,3
"Endpoints included recurrent VT , time to first ICD therapy for VT , and death .",3
"Of 243 screened patients , 27 were enrolled .",3
"Main reasons for screen failures were : ( 1 ) patient was already on an antiarrhythmic medication ( 88 [ 41 % ] ) , ( 2 ) VT due to a reversible cause ( 23 [ 11 % ] ) , and ( 3 ) incessant VT ( 20 [ 9 % ] ) .",3
"Fourteen patients had recurrent VT , 8 ( 62 % ) in the ablation arm and 6 ( 43 % ) in the antiarrhythmic medication arm .",3
"Median time to recurrent VT was 75 days ( 25th , 75th : 51 , 89 ) in the ablation arm and 57 days ( 30 , 145 ) in the antiarrhythmic arm .",3
"Four patients died , 2 in each arm .",3
"This clinical trial shows that most patients in clinical practice have already failed antiarrhythmic drug therapy before catheter ablation is considered , and the VT recurrence rates and death in these patients are high .",4
"For a large clinical trial to be feasible , factors limiting early consideration of catheter ablation need to be identified and addressed .",4
"The SMADS-study evaluates a complex , low threshold intervention for ambulatory patients presenting ADSom-symptoms , empowering them to better manage their condition , as well as improving their motivation to engage in self-help and health-seeking behaviour .",4

"In aggregate , PPARGC1A variation was strongly associated with baseline triacylglycerol concentrations ( p = 2.910 ( -30 ) ) , BMI ( p = 2.010 ( -5 ) ) and visceral adiposity ( p = 1.910 ( -4 ) ) , as well as with changes in triacylglycerol concentrations ( p = 1.710 ( -5 ) ) and BMI ( p = 9.910 ( -5 ) ) from baseline to 1 year .",3
PPARGC1B variation was only associated with baseline subcutaneous adiposity ( p = 0.01 ) .,3
"In individual SNP analyses , Gly482Ser ( rs8192678 , PPARGC1A ) was associated with accumulation of subcutaneous adiposity and worsening insulin resistance at 1 year ( both p < 0.05 ) , while rs2970852 ( PPARGC1A ) modified the effects of metformin on triacylglycerol levels ( p ( interaction ) = 0.04 ) .",3

"Exercise capacity , evaluated by the 6-min walking test , improved significantly in the pravastatin group ( p < 0.001 ) , but no change was observed in the pitavastatin group ( p = 0.371 ) .",3
Very low dose/low potency pravastatin and high dose/high potency pitavastatin had a beneficial effect on cardiac reverse remodeling and improved systolic function in patients with ischemic CHF .,4
"However , only pravastatin significantly improved exercise capacity .",4
These findings suggest that lowering cholesterol too much may not be beneficial for patients with CHF .,4

The median reported baseline pain in the bupivacaine group was 80 mm ( IQR 66 mm - 93 mm ) and 78.5 mm ( IQR 64 mm to 91.75 mm ) in the normal saline solution group .,3
"A 50 % reduction in pain was achieved in 48.8 % of the bupivacaine group ( 20/41 patients ) versus 41.3 % in the normal saline solution group ( 19/46 patients ) , for an absolute risk difference of 7.5 % ( 95 % confidence interval [ CI ] -13 % to 27.1 % ) .",3
"As a secondary outcome , at 24 hours , more patients in the bupivacaine group were headache free ( 24.7 % difference ; 95 % CI 2.6 % to 43.6 % ) and more were nausea free ( 16.9 % difference ; 95 % CI 0.8 % to 32.5 % ) .",3
"For patients with acute anterior headache , sphenopalatine ganglion block with the Tx360 device with bupivacaine did not result in a significant increase in the proportion of patients achieving a greater than or equal to 50 % reduction in headache severity at 15 minutes compared with saline solution applied in the same manner .",4
The patients experienced both clinically and statistically significant pain reduction when a vibration stimulus was co-administered with the dermal filler injections .,3
No adverse events were reported .,3
The majority of the patients ( 95 % ) reported a preference for vibration anesthesia with subsequent dermal filler injections .,3
Vibration is a safe and effective method of achieving anesthesia during facial dermal filler injections .,4
"CBT in both BLP and PLP groups significantly improved GAD severity ( GAD Severity Scale ) , anxiety ( Spielberger State-Trait Anxiety Inventory ; Structured Interview Guide for the Hamilton Anxiety Scale ) , depression ( Patient Health Questionnaire ) , insomnia ( Insomnia Severity Index ) , and mental health quality of life ( Short-Form-12 ) , relative to UC .",3
Response rates defined by 20 % reduction from pre - to posttreatment in at least three of four primary outcomes were higher for study completers in BLP and PLP relative to UC ( BLP : 38.5 % ; PLP : 40.0 % ; UC : 19.1 % ) .,3
"Lay providers , working under the supervision of licensed providers , can deliver effective CBT .",4
"Between Jan 6 , 2007 , and Feb 1 , 2013 , apart from the period between May 15 , 2009 , and Feb 8 , 2011 , when recruitment was on hold , 803 patients were randomly assigned to receive either simvastatin 40 mg ( n = 391 ) or placebo ( n = 412 ) .",3
All patients were included in the intention-to-treat population .,3
"782 ( 97 % ) patients had outcome data recorded at 6 months , of whom 560 ( 72 % ) were classed as having a favourable outcome , mRS 0-2 ( 271 patients in the simvastatin group vs 289 in the placebo group ) .",3
"The primary ordinal analysis of the mRS , adjusted for age and World Federation of Neurological Surgeons grade on admission , gave a common odds ratio ( OR ) of 097 , 95 % CI 075-125 ; p = 0803 .",3
"At 6 months , we recorded 37 ( 10 % ) deaths in the simvastatin group compared with 35 ( 9 % ) in the placebo group ( log-rank p = 0592 ) .",3
70 ( 18 % ) serious adverse events were reported in the simvastatin group compared with 74 ( 18 % ) in the placebo group .,3
No suspected unexpected serious adverse reactions were reported .,3
The STASH trial did not detect any benefit in the use of simvastatin for long-term or short-term outcome in patients with aneurysmal subarachnoid haemorrhage .,4
"Despite demonstrating no safety concerns , we conclude that patients with subarachnoid haemorrhage should not be treated routinely with simvastatin during the acute stages .",4
"In the intention-to-treat analysis , the periarticular injection group had a significantly lower area under the curve for pain score at rest ( 788.0 versus 1065.9 ; p = 0.0059 ) .",3
"In the periarticular injection group , the mean knee flexion angle was small but significantly better at postoperative day 1 ( 64.2 versus 54.6 ; p = 0.0072 ) and postoperative day 2 ( 70.3 versus 64.6 ; p = 0.021 ) than in the epidural analgesia group .",3
The incidence of nausea at postoperative day 1 was significantly lower in the periarticular injection group ( 4.0 % versus 44.3 % ; p < 0.0001 ) .,3
Transient peroneal nerve palsy was frequently seen in the periarticular injection group ( 12.0 % versus 1.6 % ; p = 0.026 ) .,3
"Compared with epidural analgesia , periarticular injection offers better postoperative pain relief , earlier recovery of knee flexion angle , and lower incidence of nausea .",4
Care should be taken to avoid transient peroneal nerve palsy when using periarticular injection .,4
This trial will determine if dietary flaxseed is efficacious over six months as an anti-hypertensive therapy in subjects newly diagnosed with hypertension .,4
"If flaxseed can effectively reduce blood pressure as a monotherapy , then flaxseed will provide individuals on a global basis with a cost-effective food-based strategy to control hypertension .",4
Results from a clinical study using the indocyanine green dilution method in 36 subjects with type 2 diabetes indicate that the estimated plasma volumes are considerably lower when using the traditional back-extrapolation method than when using the proposed back-extrapolation method ( mean ( standard deviation ) plasma volume = 26.8 ( 5.4 ) mL/kg for the traditional method vs 35.1 ( 7.0 ) mL/kg for the proposed method ) .,3
The results obtained using the proposed method are more consistent with previously reported plasma volume values .,3
"Based on the more physiological representation of indocyanine green kinetics and greater consistency with previously reported plasma volume values , the new back-extrapolation method is proposed for use when estimating plasma volume using the indocyanine green dilution method .",4
"Most infants had low ( < 50 nmol/l ) 25 ( OH ) D levels at 1 mo , but with supplementation levels rose .",3
"Overall , levels of 25 ( OH ) D differed significantly in proportion to vD dose .",3
There were no effects of vD on illness incidence or growth .,3
"Low levels were common , with 7.8 % of levels being < 50 nmol/l and 15 infants having 2 to 4 low levels .",3
The four doses of vD produced different plasma levels of 25 ( OH ) D.,4
The higher doses were somewhat more efficacious in maintaining vD sufficiency in breastfed infants .,4
"The findings support the recommended dose of 400 IU/d , and stress the need to start supplementation at birth .",4
Thirty-eight percent of women in the cefoxitin group and 40 % of women in the placebo group developed fever ( P = 0.68 ) .,3
"The risk difference ( 95 % confidence interval ) for fever 38C during labor ( antibiotic versus placebo ) was -2.0 % ( -11.5 to 7.5 ) , and for fever > 39C during labor was -1.5 % ( -4.7 to 1.7 ) .",3
"Approximately half of each study group had placental neutrophilic inflammation , but administration of cefoxitin had no significant effect on any grade of neutrophilic inflammation .",3
"Fever developed significantly more often in the women with placental neutrophilic inflammation compared with those without such inflammation ( 73/158 vs 33/144 , P < 0.001 ; risk difference 23 % [ 95 % confidence interval , 13.0-34 .0 ] ) .",3
There were no significant differences in any neonatal outcomes between the antibiotic and placebo study groups .,3
Sepsis was not diagnosed in any of the infants .,3
There were no neonatal deaths .,3
"Fever during labor epidural analgesia is associated with placental inflammation , but fever and placental inflammation were not reduced with antibiotic prophylaxis .",4
This finding suggests that infection is unlikely to be the cause in its development .,4
"The exposure measures were highly comparable , and almost all models resulted in significant associations between exposure to time-varying magnetic fields within a static magnetic field and performance on a reaction and line bisection task .",3
"In a controlled experimental setup , distance to the bore is a good proxy for personal exposure when placing subjects at fixed positions with standardized head movements in the magnetic stray fields of a 7 T MRI .",4
"Use of a magnetic field dosimeter is , however , important for estimating quantitative exposure response associations .",4
A total of 614 patients were randomized and administered doses .,3
"Evolocumab treatment reduced LDL-C from baseline , on average , by 55 % to 57 % more than placebo and 38 % to 40 % more than ezetimibe ( p < 0.001 for all comparisons ) .",3
Evolocumab treatment also favorably altered other lipoprotein levels .,3
"Treatment-emergent adverse events ( AEs ) , muscle-related AEs , and laboratory abnormalities were comparable across treatment groups .",3
"In the largest monotherapy trial using a PCSK9 inhibitor to date , evolocumab yielded significant LDL-C reductions compared with placebo or ezetimibe and was well tolerated in patients with hypercholesterolemia .",4

"Pupils in the active VFT displayed significantly less sedentary time ( p < 0.001 ) , and significantly more light ( p < 0.001 ) , moderate ( p = 0.01 ) and vigorous physical activity ( p < 0.001 ) than sedentary VFT pupils .",3
No differences in content recall were found between intervention groups : suggesting that adding physical activity into classroom teaching may not compromise attainment .,3
High acceptability was found in teachers and active VFT students rated their session significantly higher than sedentary pupils ( p < 0.002 ) .,3
This one-day pilot provides early evidence of the ability of VFTs to convert sedentary academic time into active time .,4
Longitudinal research is needed to assess prolonged effects of active VFTs in reducing sedentary time .,4
"At the 6 mo follow-up , the symptoms of the BFT group patients showed significantly greater improvements compared with the PEG group regarding difficult evacuation , hard stools , digitation necessity , laxative dependence , perianal pain at defecation , constipation satisfaction , Wexner Constipation Score , and quality of life score ( P < 0.05 ) .",3
The quality of life score of the BFT group at the final follow-up time ( 6 mo ) was 80 2.2 .,3
"After a complete course of training , improvements in the clinical symptoms of the BFT group were markedly improved ( P < 0.05 ) , and the Wexner Constipation Scores were greatly decreased compared with the oral PEG group ( P < 0.05 ) .",3
We concluded that manometric biofeedback-guided pelvic floor exercise training is superior to oral polyethylene glycol therapy for obstructive defecation .,4
"Gene expression of hypoxia-inducible factor 1 alpha , cytochrome c oxidase subunit 4 , peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma coactivator 1 alpha , hexokinase , phosphofructokinase , mitochondrial fission 1 , and mitofusin-2 increased with exercise ( P < .05 ) but did not differ with hypoxic exposure ( P > .05 ) .",3
Optic atrophy 1 did not increase with exercise or differ between environmental conditions ( P > .05 ) .,3
"The improvements in mitochondrial function reported with intermittent hypoxic training may not be explained by a single acute hypoxic exposure , and thus it appears that a longer period of preacclimatization than a single exposure may be required .",4
This trial was terminated early due to poor patient accrual rate .,3
"From January 2009 to January 2012 , a total of 52 patients were enrolled in the current study from six centers : 27 patients in the docetaxel monotherapy arm and 25 patients in the docetaxel/oxaliplatin combination arm .",3
"Fifty-two patients were assessable for efficacy , and response rates as follows ( response rate : 14.8 % in the monotherapy arm , 24.0 % in the combination arm ; disease control rate : 48.1 % in the monotherapy arm , 76.0 % in the combination arm .",3
The median progression-free survival was 2.0 ( 95 % confidence interval = 1.2-2 .9 ) months in the monotherapy arm and 4.9 ( 95 % confidence interval = 3.6-6 .6 ) months in the combination arm ( p = 0.002 ) .,3
The most common grade 3 or 4 adverse event was neutropenia ( 14 % for monotherapy versus 32 % for combination ) .,3
No treatment-related mortality was observed .,3
Weekly docetaxel and weekly docetaxel-plus-oxalipaltin regimens were found to be well-tolerated and effective as a second-line chemotherapy for patients with advanced gastric cancer .,4
"48 patients were randomised ; ( 25 azithromycin , 23 placebo ) .",3
"It was established , post randomisation that two did not have BOS .",3
46 patients were analysed as intention to treat ( ITT ) with 33 ` Completers ' .,3
ITT analysis included placebo patients treated with open-label azithromycin after study withdrawal .,3
"The ITT analysis ( n = 46 , 177 observations ) estimated mean difference in FEV1 between treatments ( azithromycin minus placebo ) was 0.035 L , with a 95 % CI of -0.112 L to 0.182 L ( p = 0.6 ) .",3
"Five withdrawals , who were identified at the end of the study as having been randomised to placebo ( four with rapid loss in FEV1 , one withdrawn consent ) had received rescue open-label azithromycin , with improvement in subsequent FEV1 at 12weeks .",3
"Study Completers showed an estimated mean difference in FEV1 between treatment groups ( azithromycin minus placebo ) of 0.278 L , with 95 % CI for the mean difference : 0.170 L to 0.386 L ( p = < 0.001 ) .",3
Nine of 23 ITT patients in the azithromycin group had 10 % gain in FEV1 from baseline .,3
No patients in the placebo group had 10 % gain in FEV1 from baseline while on placebo ( p = 0.002 ) .,3
"Seven serious adverse events , three azithromycin , four in the placebo group , were deemed unrelated to study medication .",3
Azithromycin therapy improves FEV1 in patients with BOS and appears superior to placebo .,4
This study strengthens evidence for clinical practice of initiating azithromycin therapy in BOS .,4
"Among patients with Rockall scores 6 , the oral double-dose group had a higher cumulative rebleeding-free proportion than the oral standard-dose group ( p = 0.02 , log-rank test ) .",3
"The proportion of patients free from recurrent bleeding during the 4th-28th day in the oral double-dose group remained lower than that of the group with Rockall scores < 6 ( p = 0.03 , log-rank test ) .",3
"Among patients with Rockall scores 6 , the rebleeding rate was lower in the oral double-dose group than in the oral standard-dose group ( 4th-28th day : 10.8 % vs 28.7 % , p = 0.002 ) .",3
Double oral esomeprazole at 40mg twice daily after esomeprazole infusion reduced recurrent peptic ulcer bleeding in high-risk patients with Rockall scores 6 .,4
One hundred and seventy-two patients were included .,3
"The mean total blood loss ( and standard deviation ) collected in drains was 553.9 321.5 mL for Group 1 , 567.8 299.3 mL for Group 2 , 244.1 223.4 mL for Group 3 , and 563.5 269.7 mL for Group 4 .",3
"In comparison with the control group , Group 3 had significantly lower total blood loss ( p < 0.001 ) , but it was not significantly lower in Groups 1 and 2 .",3
The overall rate of patients who had a blood transfusion was 21.1 % ( thirty-five of 166 patients analyzed per protocol ) .,3
Two patients required transfusion in Group 3 compared with twelve patients in Group 4 ( p = 0.015 ) .,3
No significant difference was observed between the two fibrin glue groups and the control group with regard to the need for transfusion .,3
There was no difference between groups with regard to the percentage of adverse events .,3
"Neither type of fibrin glue was more effective than routine hemostasis in reducing postoperative bleeding and transfusion requirements , and we no longer use them .",4
"However , this trial supports findings from previous studies showing that intravenous tranexamic acid can decrease postoperative blood loss .",4
A total of 49 patients were enrolled .,3
"At 24 months , or 15 months after the last dose of alefacept , both the 4-hour and the 2-hour C-peptide AUCs were significantly greater in the treatment group than in the control group ( P = 0.002 and 0.015 , respectively ) .",3
Exogenous insulin requirements were lower ( P = 0.002 ) and rates of major hypoglycemic events were about 50 % reduced ( P < 0.001 ) in the alefacept group compared with placebo at 24 months .,3
There was no apparent between-group difference in glycemic control or adverse events .,3
"Alefacept treatment depleted CD4 + and CD8 + central memory T cells ( Tcm ) and effector memory T cells ( Tem ) ( P < 0.01 ) , preserved Tregs , increased the ratios of Treg to Tem and Tcm ( P < 0.01 ) , and increased the percentage of PD-1 + CD4 + Tem and Tcm ( P < 0.01 ) .",3
"In patients with newly diagnosed T1D , two 12-week courses of alefacept preserved C-peptide secretion , reduced insulin use and hypoglycemic events , and induced favorable immunologic profiles at 24 months , well over 1 year after cessation of therapy .",4
"The primary end-point ; the composite of cardiac death , myocardial infarction and target vessel revascularization ( major adverse cardiac event , MACE ) , occurred in 467 patients ( 22.3 % ) ; Cypher n = 222 ( 20.8 % ) , Taxus n = 245 ( 23.7 % ) , ns .",3
"Definite and probable stent thrombosis occurred in 107 patients ( 5.1 % ) ; Cypher n = 51 ( 4.8 % ) , Taxus n = 56 ( 5.4 % ) , ns .",3
No statistically significant differences were found in the elements of the primary end-point or in other secondary end-points between the two stent groups .,3
"After one year , the annual rates of stent thrombosis and MACE remained constant .",3
"During 5-year follow-up , the Cypher and the Taxus coronary stents had similar clinical outcome with no signs of increasing rates of adverse events over time .",4
Substantial disease burden at baseline included a very high level of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol ( 190 mg per deciliter ) in 38 of 66 patients ( 58 % ) and cirrhosis in 10 of 32 patients ( 31 % ) who underwent biopsy .,3
A total of 65 of the 66 patients who underwent randomization completed the double-blind portion of the trial and continued with open-label treatment .,3
"At 20 weeks , the alanine aminotransferase level was normal in 11 of 36 patients ( 31 % ) in the sebelipase alfa group and in 2 of 30 ( 7 % ) in the placebo group ( P = 0.03 ) , with mean changes from baseline of -58 U per liter versus -7 U per liter ( P < 0.001 ) .",3
"With respect to prespecified key secondary efficacy end points , we observed improvements in lipid levels and reduction in hepatic fat content ( P < 0.001 for all comparisons , except P = 0.04 for triglycerides ) .",3
The number of patients with adverse events was similar in the two groups ; most events were mild and were considered by the investigator to be unrelated to treatment .,3

"Overall , 329 patients were randomized to ingenol mebutate 0.015 % gel ( n = 167 ) or vehicle ( n = 162 ) 3 weeks after cryosurgery .",3
Baseline characteristics were balanced across groups .,3
"At week 11 , complete clearance rate ( 100 % ) in the treatment area was higher for ingenol mebutate gel compared with vehicle ( 60.5 % vs 49.4 % , respectively ; P = .04 ) .",3
Mean percentage reduction in number of AKs versus baseline was also numerically higher for ingenol mebutate gel ( 82.7 % vs 75.6 % ) .,3
A general reduction from baseline lesion count was observed 3 weeks after cryosurgery .,3
Treatment after cryosurgery was well tolerated .,3
Short-term ( 11-week ) AK clearance rates on the face or scalp with ingenol mebutate gel after cryosurgery were higher than with cryosurgery alone .,4
The EMG activity of the masticatory muscles and pain and fatigue scores were not dependent on isotonic saline/glutamate injection ( all P > .05 ) .,3
"The RMS in the temporalis and masseter muscles increased with time ( right masseter P = 0.001 , left masseter P = .004 , right temporalis P = .22 , left temporalis P = .006 ) , whereas the MPF decreased ( right masseter P = .0001 , left masseter P < .0001 , right temporalis P = .51 , left temporalis P = .0005 ) .",3
Scores for fatigue and pain increased during the experimental sessions ( all P < .05 ) .,3
Intramuscular injection of glutamate caused more pain than isotonic saline but did not affect the contraction pattern of the masticatory muscles during a sustained clenching task .,4
This finding strongly suggests the adaptive capacity of the stomatognathic system in the presence of acute nociceptive inputs .,4
Supplementation of RBEP significantly increased IFN - production compared with the placebo group ( P = 0.012 ) .,3
"However , RBEP supplementation did not affect either NK cell activity or cytokine levels , including IL-2 , IL-4 , IL-10 , IL-12 , and TNF - , compared with the placebo group .",3
"The data obtained in this study indicate that RBEP supplementation increases IFN - secretion without causing significant adverse effects , and thus may be beneficial to healthy individuals .",4
This new rice bran-derived product may therefore be potentially useful to include in the formulation of solid and liquid foods designed for treatment and prevention of pathological states associated with defective immune responses .,4
A total of 154 patients ( 2.2 % ) had or developed psoriasis and new-onset atrial fibrillation occurred in 506 patients ( 7.1 % ) during a mean follow-up of 4.7 1.1 years .,3
"At baseline , the psoriasis patients were younger ( 65 7 vs. 67 7 years ) and had less left ventricle hypertrophy by ECG Sokolow-Lyon voltage ( 27.6 9.7 vs. 30.1 10.4 mm ) ; higher hemoglobin ( 6.3 2.2 vs. 6.0 2.7 mmol/l ) and prevalence of diabetes ( 20.6 vs. 12.8 % , P 0.004 ) than patients without psoriasis .",3
"In multivariable Cox analysis , adjusting for age , sex , hemoglobin , diabetes , time-varying SBP , heart rate , study treatment and Sokolow-Lyon hypertrophy , psoriasis , treated as a time-varying covariate , was associated with a two-fold higher risk of new-onset atrial fibrillation [ hazard ratio : 1.97 ( 95 % confidence interval ( CI ) : 1.18-3 .30 ) , P = 0.01 ] .",3
"Propensity-matched analysis yielded similar results ( odds ratio : 3.49 , 95 % CI 1.24-9 .81 , P = 0.018 ) .",3
Psoriasis has a similar prevalence in hypertensive patients as in the general population .,4
Psoriasis independently predicted new-onset atrial fibrillation despite lower age and electrocardiographic LVH in psoriasis patients than in patients without psoriasis .,4
"Therapy changes differed between the Ab testing and usual care arms ( 19.6 % and 14.0 % , respectively ; p = 0004 ) .",3
Results from Ab testing were more frequently reported as the reason for therapy change in the Ab testing arm than in the usual care arm ( p < 0.0001 ) .,3
NAb and BAb positivity significantly increased the likelihood of therapy change and reduced IFN-associated adverse events .,3
BAb titres were a significant predictor of NAb positivity ( p = 0.0012 ) .,3
Initial BAb-positive and NAb-positive status in both study arms had a significant impact on the overall number of patients with a therapy change ( p < 0.05 ) .,3
Access to Ab test results impacted therapy management .,4
BAb titres can predict NAb positivity in patients on high-dose IFN .,4
"At the one-year follow-up , the survival and success rate was 100 % for all implants .",3
There was no statistically significant difference in the amount of vertical bone loss between groups after 1 year ( p > 0.05 ) .,3
"For the test group , there was a mean mesial bone loss of -0.8 + / - 0.6 mm and a mean distal bone loss of -0.5 + / - 0.4 mm .",3

"Between Dec 12 , 2011 , and Dec 20 , 2012 , 433 participants were randomly assigned and received at least one dose of study drug .",3
"Of these participants , 293 were assigned to switch to the simplified regimen ( switch group ) and 140 to remain on their existing regimen ( no-switch group ) ; after exclusions , 290 and 139 participants , respectively , were analysed in the modified intention-to-treat population .",3
"At week 48 , 272 ( 938 % ) of 290 participants in the switch group maintained a viral load of less than 50 copies per mL , compared with 121 ( 871 % ) of 139 in the no-switch group ( difference 67 % , 95 % CI 04-137 ; p = 0025 ) .",3
The statistical superiority of the simplified regimen was mainly caused by a higher proportion of participants in the no-switch group than in the switch group discontinuing treatment for non-virological reasons ; virological failure was rare in both groups ( two [ 1 % ] of 290 vs two [ 1 % ] of 139 ) .,3
We did not detect any treatment-emergent resistance in either group .,3
Adverse events leading to discontinuation were rare in both groups ( six [ 2 % ] of 293 vs four [ 3 % ] of 140 ) .,3
"Switching to the simplified regimen was associated with a small , non-progressive increase from baseline in serum creatinine concentration .",3
"Nausea was more common in the switch group than in the no-switch group , but rates of diarrhoea and bloating decreased compared with baseline from week 4 to week 48 in the switch group , whereas there were generally no changes for these symptoms in the no-switch group .",3
"Coformulated elvitegravir , cobicistat , emtricitabine , and tenofovir might be a useful regimen simplification option for virologically supressed adults with HIV taking a multitablet ritonavir-boosted protease inhibitor regimen .",4

"In the re-therapy subgroups , higher treatment response rates in patients not responding earlier was found in group A than group B ( 39 % vs. 16 % , p > 0.05 ) .",3
No significant advantage was found in the use of a priming method over a standard regimen .,4
"However , it could be recommended in patients with a total lack of response to peg-IFN and ribavirin when no other therapeutic options are available .",4
60 % ( 582/960 ) of women had 25-OHD levels < 75 nmol/L at 32 weeks gestation .,3
"Infants born to women with 25-OHD deficiency ( < 37.5 nmol/L ) had reduced developmental language scores compared to those born to women who were vitamin D replete ( 75 nmol/L ) ( Mean Difference ( MD ) -3.48 , 95 % Confidence Interval ( CI ) -5.67 to -1.28 ) .",3
"For every 25 nmol increase in 25-OHD concentration in late pregnancy , infant length-for-age z scores at 6 months of age decreased by 0.08 ( 95 % CI -0.15 to -0.02 ) .",3
"Low maternal 25 - hydroxyvitamin D levels during late pregnancy are of concern in rural Vietnam , and are associated with reduced language developmental outcomes at 6 months of age .",4
Our findings strengthen the evidence for giving vitamin D supplementation during pregnancy .,4
"The trial included five pharmacies ; five pharmacists and five pharmaconomists , and 205 patients ; BI ( 39 patients ) , EI ( 41 patients ) , Control ( 125 patients ) .",3
Patient reported systolic blood pressure improved in both groups and significantly in the EI group compared to the control group ( P = 0.020 ) .,3
"Increase in disease-related knowledge was higher in the EI group compared to the control group ( P = 0.006 ) , but not in the BI group ( P = 0.139 ) .",3
"Except for quality of life , the EI group reported significantly higher improvement in all aspects of beneficial effects from participating in the trial when compared to the control group .",3
No significant differences were detected for changes in hospital admissions or in doctor visits .,3
The two intervention groups reported significantly higher satisfaction with all aspects of patient satisfaction with pharmacy staff in the project than control patients .,3
"The study showed improvement in patient health , well-being , knowledge , and satisfaction as a result of the trial , particularly for the EI group .",4
"Thus a program comprising patient narratives , problem and resource identification , and multi-dimensional individually tailored patient medication management solutions seems to be an appropriate intervention to ensure outcome improvement of non-adherent patients .",4
313 students were recruited ; the results of 256 were suitable for analysis .,3
"The OSCE results were excellent in both groups and did not differ significantly ( control group : median 9 , interquantil range ( IQR ) 8-9 , study group : median 9 , IQR 8-9 ; p = 0.29 ) .",3

"At 2 years , eyes with sustained visual acuity loss had more scarring ( 60.0 % vs 41.4 % , P = .007 ) , more geographic atrophy ( GA ) ( 31.6 % vs 20.7 % , P = .004 ) , larger lesions ( 16 vs 8 mm2 , P < .001 ) , and higher proportions of intraretinal fluid ( 82.5 % vs 51.0 % , P < .001 ) , subretinal hyperreflective material ( 84.5 % vs 44.2 % , P < .001 ) , retinal thinning ( 43.3 % vs 23.0 % , P < .001 ) , and thickening ( 20.0 % vs 12.1 % , P < .001 ) .",3
"Likely causes of sustained visual acuity loss included foveal scarring ( 44.3 % ) , pigmentary abnormalities ( 27.9 % ) , and foveal GA ( 11.5 % ) .",3
"Baseline factors independently associated with a higher incidence of sustained visual acuity loss were the presence of nonfoveal GA ( odds ratio [ OR ] , 2.86 ; 95 % CI , 1.35-6 .08 ; P = .006 ) , larger area of choroidal neovascularization ( OR for a > 4-disc area vs 1-disc area , 3.91 ; 95 % CI , 1.70-9 .03 ; P = .007 ) , and bevacizumab treatment ( OR , 1.83 ; 95 % CI , 1.07-3 .14 ; P = .03 ) .",3
Sustained visual acuity loss was relatively rare in CATT .,4
"The development of foveal scar , pigmentary abnormalities , or GA contributed to most of the sustained visual acuity loss .",4
Risk was 3 % higher among eyes treated with bevacizumab .,4
Treatment that targeted the prevention of scarring or GA may improve vision outcomes .,4
A total of 101 patients ( 58 women ) with a mean age of 49.5 years ( 20-80 years ) were enrolled .,3
"Laser lithotripsy ( mean stone size , 11.8 mm ) was performed in 88 patients , 10 underwent stone basketing , and 3 had diagnostic ureteroscopy .",3
"For the DUR-D and URF-V , the mean total operative time ( 26.5 vs 25 minutes ) , laser time ( 12.5 vs 13 minutes ) , lower pole time ( 9 vs 11 minutes ) , and basket time ( 14.5 vs 13 minutes ) were comparable .",3
"In 3 of 45 ( 6.6 % ) and 6 of 56 ( 10.7 % ) cases , the stone could not be reached with the DUR-D and URF-V , respectively .",3
A fiberoptic scope ( URF-P5 ) reached the stone in all cases .,3
"On a scale of 0-10 , the mean visibility was 6.86 and 8.73 ( P < .01 ) and the maneuverability was 7.18 and 8.17 ( P < .01 ) for DUR-D and URF-V , respectively .",3
"There were 8 repairs , 4 for each scope .",3
The DUR-D averaged 11.25 cases per repair and the URF-V averaged 14 .,3
The URF-V offered better visibility and maneuverability compared with the DUR-D .,4
Both had similar failure rates compared with the previous study with fiberoptic scopes .,4
"Of 19 748 CEAs , 19 348 ( 97.97 % ) were functionally independent , 377 ( 1.99 % ) were functionally partially dependent , and 23 ( 0.12 % ) were functionallydependent .",3
"In functionally independent group , there were 196 ( 1.01 % ) strokes , 84 ( 0.43 % ) deaths , and 1416 ( 7.17 % ) other complications , whereas in the functionally partially dependent group , there were 14 ( 3.71 % ) strokes , 10 ( 2.65 % ) deaths , and 80 ( 21.22 % ) other complications .",3
"In multivariable risk-adjusted model , using functionally independent as reference , functionally partially dependent was associated with death ( odds ratio , 3.3 ; 95 % confidence interval , 1.6-6 .8 ; P < 0.001 ) , stroke ( odds ratio , 3 ; 95 % confidence interval , 1.7-5 .4 ; P < 0.001 ) , and other complications ( odds ratio , 2.5 ; 95 % confidence interval , 1.9-3 .2 ; P < 0.001 ) .",3
"In this national data set , patient 's inability to perform basic activities of independent living is associated with adverse postoperative outcomes after CEA .",4
"Hence , FNS should be vigilantly assessed in clinic for risk stratification along with other objective factors for gauging risk of adverse outcomes after CEA .",4
"In modified intent-to-treat analyses that excluded women with miscarriages ( n = 6 ) , gestational diabetes ( n = 32 ) , or subsequent pregnancies ( n = 32 ) , the intervention had no significant effect on the odds of achieving prepregnancy weight at 12 mo postpartum ( n = 331 ; 35.4 % compared with 28.1 % ; P = 0.18 ) .",3
Completer analyses suggested that the intervention tended to increase the percentages of women who reached prepregnancy weight ( n = 261 ; 45.3 % compared with 35.3 % ; P = 0.09 ) and significantly reduced the magnitude of mean SD postpartum weight retained ( 1.4 6.3 compared with 3.0 5.7 kg ; P = 0.046 ) at 12 mo. .,3
Women in the intervention group reported higher dietary restraint through 6 mo postpartum ( P = 0.023 ) and more frequent self-monitoring of body weight ( P < 0.02 for all ) throughout the study .,3
A low-intensity behavioral intervention in pregnancy can reduce 12-mo postpartum weight retention and improve dietary restraint and self-weighing in study completers .,4
Future research is needed to test the long-term effects of more intensive behavioral interventions in pregnancy .,4
This trial was registered at clinicaltrials.gov as NCT01117961 .,4
The basal and stimulated C-peptide levels increased significantly as age and BMIZ increased ( P < 0.05 ) .,3
Both age and BMIZ had a stronger impact on the upper quartile of C-peptide distributions than the lower quartile .,3
Sex was only significantly associated with stimulated C-peptide .,3
Higher stimulated C-peptide levels were generally observed in girls compared with boys at the same age and BMIZ ( P < 0.05 ) .,3
"HLA type and number of positive antibodies and antibody titers ( islet cell antibody [ ICA ] , insulin autoantibody , GAD65A , and ICA512A ) were not significantly associated with C-peptide distribution after adjustment for age , BMIZ , and sex .",3
"Age - , sex - , and BMIZ-specific C-peptide percentiles can be estimated for North American children and adolescents at risk for T1D .",4
They can be used as an assessment tool that could impact the recommendations in T1D prevention trials .,4
AHA revealed a superior effect in the BoNT-A/OT group at 12months : 6 out of 10 improved compared with 1 out of 10 in the occupational therapy group ( p < 0.03 ) .,3
A 95 % Peskun exact confidence interval for the difference in proportions is given as 0.01 to 0.81 .,3
Secondary outcomes improved in both groups .,3
Repeated BoNT-A/OT appeared superior to occupational therapy alone for bimanual performance in young children with USCP .,4
Active ROM and goal performance improved in both groups .,4
"A total of 602 patients ( 53.3 % male ; median age , 34 years ) were recruited , and 571 patients underwent PET scanning .",3
"The PET findings were negative in 426 of these patients ( 74.6 % ) , 420 of whom were randomly assigned to a study group ( 209 to the radiotherapy group and 211 to no further therapy ) .",3
"At a median of 60 months of follow-up , there had been 8 instances of disease progression in the radiotherapy group , and 8 patients had died ( 3 with disease progression , 1 of whom died from Hodgkin 's lymphoma ) ; there had been 20 instances of disease progression in the group with no further therapy , and 4 patients had died ( 2 with disease progression and none from Hodgkin 's lymphoma ) .",3
"In the radiotherapy group , 5 of the deaths occurred in patients who received no radiotherapy .",3
"The 3-year progression-free survival rate was 94.6 % ( 95 % confidence interval [ CI ] , 91.5 to 97.7 ) in the radiotherapy group and 90.8 % ( 95 % CI , 86.9 to 94.8 ) in the group that received no further therapy , with an absolute risk difference of -3.8 percentage points ( 95 % CI , -8.8 to 1.3 ) .",3
The results of this study did not show the noninferiority of the strategy of no further treatment after chemotherapy with regard to progression-free survival .,4
"Nevertheless , patients in this study with early-stage Hodgkin 's lymphoma and negative PET findings after three cycles of ABVD had a very good prognosis either with or without consolidation radiotherapy .",4
"( Funded by Leukaemia and Lymphoma Research and others ; RAPID ClinicalTrials.gov number , NCT00943423 . )",4
The number of detected lesions was largest in delayed studies of MPRAGE in both groups .,3
The SNR of the lesions was statistically lower in early studies of Group A than other studies .,3
Delayed studies of Group B showed statistically better margin delineation than other studies on both SE-T1WI and MPRAGE studies .,3
Diameter and enhanced volume were statistically significantly larger on delayed phase than early phase in both groups .,3
Use of a single injection of double-dose contrast medium and longer delay time may improve margin delineation of lesions for the study of brain metastasis .,4
"Enhanced volume was larger on delayed phase , and it may influence selection of therapeutic strategy .",4
"Of 379 included sciatica patients , 158 ( 42 % ) had disabling back pain .",3
"Of the patients with both sciatica and disabling back pain 68 % did reveal a herniated disc with nerve root compression on MRI , compared to 88 % of patients with predominantly sciatica ( P < 0.001 ) .",3
"The existence of disabling back pain in sciatica at baseline was negatively associated with perceived recovery at one year ( Odds ratio [ OR ] 0.32 , 95 % Confidence Interval 0.18-0 .56 , P < 0.001 ) .",3
"Sciatica patients with disabling back pain in absence of nerve root compression on MRI at baseline reported less perceived recovery at one year compared to those with predominantly sciatica and nerve root compression on MRI ( 50 % vs 91 % , P < 0.001 ) .",3
Sciatica patients with disabling low back pain reported an unfavorable outcome at one-year follow-up compared to those with predominantly sciatica .,4
"If additionally a clear herniated disc with nerve root compression on MRI was absent , the results were even worse .",4
"This study is novel in that we are using a robust study design in CKD patients ( not on dialysis ) comparing placebo to different forms of vitamin D supplementation in fixed doses , irrespective of baseline values .",4
We hope to demonstrate the biological mechanistic effect of vitamin D supplementation on vascular function in order for this information to be used in designing larger randomized controlled trials .,4
The recommended phase II dose ( RP2D ) was 150mg BID of nintedanib combined with standard dose of weekly paclitaxel followed by adriamycin plus cyclophosphamide .,3
The dose-limiting toxicity was transaminase elevation .,3
"At the RP2D , the dose intensity was 100 % .",3
The pathologic complete response was 50 % .,3
"The combination allows the delivery of full-dose intensity , while efficacy seems promising .",4
Total lifestyle scores improved in both arms .,3
The improvement was smaller in the ` invited-to-screening ' arm ( score 1.43 at inclusion ; 1.58 after 11years ) compared with the control arm ( score 1.49 at inclusion ; 1.67 after 11years ) ; adjusted difference -0.05 ( 95 % CI -0.09 to -0.01 ; p = 0.03 ) .,3
The change in the score was less favourable in screening attendees with a positive compared with negative screening result ; adjusted difference -0.16 ( 95 % CI -0.25 to -0.08 ; p < 0.001 ) .,3
The present study suggests that possible unfavourable lifestyle changes after CRC screening are modest .,4
Lifestyle counselling may be considered as part of cancer screening programmes .,4
"The GPs experienced challenges when trying to convince patients that the medication they used to treat and prevent headache could cause headache , but labelling MOH as a diagnosis opened up a space for change .",3
"GPs were able to use BI within the scope of a regular consultation , and they thought that the structured approach had a potential to change patients ' views about their condition and medication use .",3
"Being diagnosed with medication overuse could bring about feelings of guilt in patients , and GPs emphasised that a good alliance with the patient was necessary for successful change using BI to manage MOH .",3
"GPs experience BI as a feasible strategy to treat MOH , and the technique relies on a good alliance between the doctor and patient .",4
"When using BI , GPs must be prepared to counter patients ' misconceptions about medication used for headache .",4
There was no difference in demographic data between groups .,3
The level of anxiety in children showed no difference between groups at two measured times .,3
"There was statistically significant difference in anxiety levels between WR and OR in both groups , p = 0.0019 for CG and p < 0.0001 for GI , as well as the prevalence of anxiety for CG ( 38.9 % WR and 69.4 % OR , p = 0.0174 ) and GI ( 19.4 % WR and 83.3 % OR , p < 0.0001 ) .",3
The anxiety level of guardians did not differ between groups .,3
"Regardless of the quality of information provided to the guardians , the level and prevalence of anxiety in children were low at WR time and significantly increased at OR time .",4
"Crow 's feet severity at rest and maximum contraction was improved to a similar extent by both treatments , in both cycles and on both sides of the face .",3
Pooled data confirmed these results .,3
"Improvements were maintained at the final visit , 3 months after treatment ( e.g. , left side at maximum contraction-onabotulinumtoxinA mean score : 2.21 [ baseline ] vs 0.93 [ 1 month ] vs 1.71 [ 3 months ] ; incobotulinumtoxinA mean score : 2.21 vs 0.86 vs 1.50 ) .",3
"IncobotulinumtoxinA and onabotulinumtoxinA ( 1:1 dose conversion ratio ) were well tolerated , showing comparable efficacy and duration of treatment effect for crow 's feet .",4
"Between Sept 21 and Dec 21 , 2010 , 2954 participants were randomly assigned ( 987 assigned to control [ 984 analysed ] , 979 assigned to 4CMenB [ 974 analysed ] , 988 assigned to MenACWY-CRM [ 983 analysed ] ) ; 33 % of the 4CMenB group , 34 % of the MenACWY-CRM group , and 31 % of the control group were positive for meningococcal carriage at study entry .",3
"By 1 month , there was no significant difference in carriage between controls and 4CMenB ( odds ratio 12 , 95 % CI 08-17 ) or MenACWY-CRM ( 09 , [ 06-13 ] ) groups .",3
"From 3 months after dose two , 4CMenB vaccination resulted in significantly lower carriage of any meningococcal strain ( 182 % [ 95 % CI 34-308 ] carriage reduction ) , capsular groups BCWY ( 266 % [ 105-399 ] carriage reduction ) , capsular groups CWY ( 296 % [ 81-460 ] carriage reduction ) , and serogroups CWY ( 285 % [ 28-475 ] carriage reduction ) compared with control vaccination .",3
Significantly lower carriage rates were also noted in the MenACWY-CRM group compared with controls : 390 % ( 95 % CI 173-550 ) carriage reduction for serogroup Y and 362 % ( 156-517 ) carriage reduction for serogroup CWY .,3
"Study vaccines were generally well tolerated , with increased rates of transient local injection pain and myalgia in the 4CMenB group .",3
No safety concerns were identified .,3
"Although we detected no significant difference between groups at 1 month after vaccine course , MenACWY-CRM and 4CMenB vaccines reduced meningococcal carriage rates during 12 months after vaccination and therefore might affect transmission when widely implemented .",4
"Fentanyl improved the VAS score significantly ( 1.61.32 ) compared to the saline group ( 3.771.0 , P < 0.0001 ) .",3
It also reduced the intraoperaitve analgesic supplementation compared to the saline group .,3
( P = 0.031 ) .,3
"The postoperative duration of analgesia was prolonged in the fentanyl group ( 275.8013.61 min ) compared to the saline group ( 191.4712.16 min , P < 0.0001 ) .",3
The other characteristics of epidural block were unaltered .,3
Addition of 50 g fentanyl to epidural 0.5 % bupivacaine significantly reduces the VAS score .,4
It also reduces intra-operative analgesia supplementation and prolongs the duration of postoperative analgesia without altering the other characteristics of block .,4
The neonatal outcome is not affected with addition of fentanyl before delivery of baby .,4
"The study included 320 patients , 163 in Group-A and 157 in Group-B .",3
Mean weight of resected tissue in Group-A was 46.67 9.133 grams ; it was 45.22 7.532 grams in group B. Mean catheter removal day was 4.13 1.65 days in Group-A ; and 1.23 0.933 days in Group-B .,3
Mean length of hospital stay was 3.57 days 1.028 in Group-A and 1.29 days 1.030 in Group-B ( p-value < 0.05 ) .,3
Length of hospital stay strongly correlated with the day of catheter removal .,3
There was no significant difference between the two groups in terms of postoperative complications .,3
Removal of catheter on first postoperative day after transurethral prostatectomy does not increase the postoperative complications and results in shorter hospital stay .,4
The 90 patients in the study were divided into three equal groups of 30 ( 33.33 % ) each .,3
"There were no statistically significant inter-group differences in age , bodyweight , parity , number of postmenopausal patients , haemodynamic parameters and American Society of Anesthesiologists scores ( p > 0.05 in all categories ) .",3
"In Group P , the visual analogue scale score estimated when the cervix was grasped with the tenaculum was lower when compared with Group L and Group LD ( p = 0.029 and p = 0.007 , respectively ) .",3
"At other measurement time points , the scores did not differ between the groups .",3
The groups did not differ with respect to patient and surgeon satisfaction and complication rates ( p > 0.05 ) .,3
"Intrauterine lidocaine or intrauterine lidocaine plus rectal diclofenac application had no effect on visual analogue scale scores , patient satisfaction and vasovagal reaction .",4
"When horses were premedicated with dantrolene , CO at 25 , 35 , and 45 minutes after induction of anesthesia was significantly lower than that when horses were premedicated with water after which time difficulty in obtaining valid measurements suggested a continued decrease in CO ; plasma potassium concentration progressively increased during anesthesia , whereas serum creatine kinase activity remained fairly stable and within reference limits through 12 hours after anesthesia ; and 2 of 6 horses developed cardiac arrhythmias that required medical intervention .",3
"The quality of anesthetic recovery was slightly better when horses were premedicated with dantrolene versus water , although the time required for recovery did not differ significantly between treatments .",3
Results suggested that dantrolene premedication prevented muscle damage without affecting anesthetic recovery but impaired CO and precipitated hyperkalemia and cardiac arrhythmias in healthy isoflurane-anesthetized horses .,4
"Among all participants , 79 % met criteria for major depressive disorder and 36 % met criteria for PTSD at baseline .",3
"No significant effect of CCM was observed within either subgroup for any outcome , including any use of opioids or stimulants or heavy drinking , depressive symptoms , anxiety symptoms , and any hospitalizations or number of nights hospitalized .",3
"Among participants with depression , those receiving CCM had fewer days in the emergency department compared with the control group , but the finding was of only borderline significance ( p = .06 ) .",3
"Among patients with co-occurring substance dependence and mental disorders , CCM was not significantly more effective than usual care for improving clinical outcomes or treatment utilization .",4
The prevalence of GDM was 35 % using WHO 2013 criteria vs 9 % using WHO 1999 criteria .,3
FPG measurements identified 94 % of WHO 2013 GDM cases as opposed to 11 % of WHO 1999 GDM cases .,3
"In contrast , 2-h PG measurements identified only 13 % of WHO 2013 GDM cases compared with 96 % of the WHO 1999 GDM cases .",3
"Using logistic regression with backward elimination , urban habitat , illiteracy , non-vegetarianism , increased BMI , Hindu religion and low adult height were all independent risk factors of GDM using the 1999 criteria , whereas only urban habitat , low adult height and increased age were independent risk factors of GDM using the 2013 criteria .",3
Intervention studies are needed to justify the WHO 2013 GDM criteria increasing the prevalence four fold to include more than one third of North Indian pregnant women .,4
"Two separate analyses confirmed that 0.45 mg/kg MTNX alone induced a slight degree of miosis , a centrally mediated opioid agonist effect .",3
This dose had minimal subjective effects .,3
MTNX at either or both the 0.225 and 0.45 mg/kg dose reduced some subjective effects of morphine without altering miosis .,3
We present indirect evidence that MTNX crosses the blood-brain barrier in humans .,4
"Therefore , whether the reductions in subjective effects of morphine by MTNX that were observed in past studies and in this study can be attributed to peripheral mechanisms is open to question .",4
"The median time from randomization to angiography was 48 minutes , and the median time difference between the two treatment strategies was 31 minutes .",3
The two coprimary end points did not differ significantly between the prehospital and in-hospital groups .,3
"The absence of ST-segment elevation resolution of 70 % or greater after PCI ( a secondary end point ) was reported for 42.5 % and 47.5 % of the patients , respectively .",3
The rates of major adverse cardiovascular events did not differ significantly between the two study groups .,3
The rates of definite stent thrombosis were lower in the prehospital group than in the in-hospital group ( 0 % vs. 0.8 % in the first 24 hours ; 0.2 % vs. 1.2 % at 30 days ) .,3
"Rates of major bleeding events were low and virtually identical in the two groups , regardless of the bleeding definition used .",3

Sexual dysfunction is one of the most prevalent and distressing consequences of prostate cancer .,4
"Despite this , very little is known about the management of sexual dysfunction and current health care services do not adequately meet sexual health needs of survivors .",4
"This project will examine the potential role of exercise in the management of sexual dysfunction and evaluate a potential best-practice management approach by integrating pharmacological , physiological and psychological treatment modalities to address the complex and multifaceted aetiology of sexual dysfunction following cancer .",4
"The majority of women are 25 years or older , married , have on average 4 children in the home and have never attended school .",3
Nearly 50 % of women report having at least one livestock/animal asset at baseline .,3
"Over the past 10 years , women report on average more than 4 ( M = 4.31 , SD 364 ) traumatic events ( range 0-18 ) .",3
"Women reported symptoms consistent with PTSD with a mean score of 2.30 ( SD = 066 range 0-4 ) and depression with a mean score of 1.86 ( SD = 049 , range 0-3 .47 ) .",3
The livestock/animal asset value by conflict-related traumatic events interaction was significant for both the PTSD ( p = 0021 ) and depression ( p = 0002 ) symptom models .,3
The study provides evidence of the moderating affect of livestock/animal assets on mental health symptoms for women who have experienced conflict .,4
The findings supports evidence about the importance of livestock/animal assets to economics in rural households but expands on previous research by demonstrating the psychosocial effects of these assets on women 's health .,4
"The mean difference ( 95 % CI ) in the increase of anxiety at parental separation between the TBID and the midazolam group was -9 ( -2.6 to -16.4 ) , P = 0.006 , demonstrating superiority to midazolam group ( one-sided P = 0.003 ) .",3
"For children 2-11 years , the mean difference ( 95 % CI ) in anxiety at induction was significant between the TBID and midazolam groups , -14.0 ( -6.1 to -22.0 ) , P < 0.001 .",3
"The median ( IQR ) time-to-PACU discharge was 111 ( 75-197 ) min in the midazolam group and 87 ( 55-137 ) min in the TBID group , P = 0.03 .",3
Decreased emergence delirium and increased parental satisfaction were also observed in the TBID group .,3

Triple-drug therapy decreased total USS scores by 33 % in the first week .,3
"There was a further significant decrease ( 40 % ) in total USS scores in the high , but not low , vitamin D3 treatment group by week 12 .",3
"Compared with low treatment , the high treatment group demonstrated a trend ( P = .052 ) toward lower total USS scores at week 12 , which was driven by significant decreases in body distribution and number of days with hives .",3
Beneficial trends for sleep quality and pruritus scores were observed with high vitamin D3 .,3
"Serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels increased with high vitamin D3 supplementation , but there was no correlation between 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels and USS scores .",3
There was no difference in allergy medication use between groups .,3

"Add-on therapy with high-dose vitamin D3 ( 4,000 IU/d ) could be considered a safe and potentially beneficial immunomodulator in patients with chronic urticaria .",4
"The total incidence rate of CIN was 4.47 % , while the CIN incidence rates in the PS group , the SB group , the PS + NAC group and the SB + NAC group were 3.11 , 5.03 , 4.46 and 5.33 % , respectively .",3
"The differences between these groups were not statistically significant ( P = 0.238 ) , and for patients with diabetes and/or renal dysfunction , the incidence rates of CIN among the four groups did not show statistically significant differences ( P = 0.238 , 0.156 , 0.287 ) .",3
"Use of PS , SB , and NAC caused no significant reduction in the incidence of CIN , but in high-risk patients with diabetes and/or renal dysfunction , SB + NAC might be superior to the application of isotonic crystalloid solution .",4

"In 567 hospitalized heart failure patients , NT-proCNP levels were measured at hospital discharge .",3
The primary endpoint was a combined endpoint of all-cause mortality and HF hospitalization after 18 months .,3
Heart failure with a preserved ejection fraction ( HFpEF ) was pre-defined as an LVEF > 40 % .,3
"Mean ( SD ) age was 71 11 years , 62 % were male , mean LVEF was 32 14 % , and 23 % had HFpEF .",3
"In multivariate linear regression , NT-proCNP levels showed a positive correlation with NT-proBNP levels and parameters of renal function , whereas a negative correlation with female sex and vascular endothelial growth factor was observed .",3
"After 18 months follow-up , 240 patients reached the combined endpoint .",3
We observed interaction between NT-proCNP and LVEF for outcome ( P = 0.046 ) .,3

"Among the 73 PQ-MSAS surveys administered in the last 12 weeks of life , pain was highly prevalent ( 62 % ; 58 % with high distress ) .",3
"Being female , having a brain tumor , experiencing recent disease progression , and receiving moderate - or high-intensity cancer-directed therapy in the prior 10 days were associated with worse PQ-MSAS scores .",3
"In the final 12 weeks of life , receiving mild cancer-directed therapy was associated with improved psychological PQ-MSAS scores .",3
Children with advanced cancer experience high symptom distress .,4
"Strategies to promote intensive symptom management are indicated , especially with disease progression or administration of intensive treatments .",4
"Tunnel volume enlargement between 3 weeks and 1 year after ACLR as assessed by 3-dimensional MDCT was significantly less for ACLR using ruptured tissue than for conventional ACLR , especially at the femoral site ( P < .05 ) .",3
"However , the postoperative Lysholm score , anterior stability of the knee measured with the KT-1000 arthrometer , and rate of negative manual pivot-shift test results did not differsignificantly between the 2 groups .",3
There was no correlation to the clinical outcomes in terms of tunnel size .,3
"The Lysholm score , anterior laxity measured with the KT-1000 arthrometer , and rotational instability according to the pivot-shift test did not differ significantly between ACLR using ruptured tissue and the conventional technique .",4
"However , ACLR using ruptured tissue produced less femoral tunnel enlargement as assessed by MDCT , warranting further long-term follow-up to elucidate its effectiveness .",4
Fasting insulin was significantly higher after the dairy diet than after the red meat diet ( P < 0.01 ) with no change in fasting glucose resulting in a decrease in insulin sensitivity after the high-dairy diet ( P < 0.05 ) as assessed by homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance ( HOMA-IR ) .,3
"A significant interaction between diet and sex was observed such that , in women alone , HOMA-IR was significantly lower after the red meat diet than after the dairy diet ( 1.33 0.8 compared with 1.71 0.8 , respectively ; P < 0.01 ) .",3
Insulin sensitivity calculated by using the Matsuda method was 14.7 % lower in women after the dairy diet than after the red meat diet ( P < 0.01 ) with no difference between diets in men .,3
C-peptide was not different between diets .,3
"In contrast to some epidemiologic findings , these results suggest that high consumption of dairy reduces insulin sensitivity compared with a diet high in lean red meat in overweight and obese subjects , some of whom had glucose intolerance .",4
This trial was registered at the Australian New Zealand Clinical Trials Registry as ACTRN12613000441718 .,4
"In response to tendon taps , neither fascicle length nor velocity changes were correlated with SLR size in either muscle , but accelerometer peaks were observed immediately after hammer-tendon contact .",3
Similar results were obtained after dorsiflexion stretches .,3
"Muscle fascicle stretch is poorly correlated with SLR size , regardless of perturbation parameters .",4
"We attribute the SLR trigger to the transmission of vibration through the lower limb , rather than muscle fiber stretch .",4
108 subjects fulfilled the criteria of the current study protocol and were included in the analyses .,3
"A weak but significant negative correlation between O3I and TAG was observed ( r = -0.211 , p < 0.05 ) .",3
"However , the relation between O3I and serum TAG was not linear ( coefficients of determination R ( 2 ) : 0.044 ) .",3
"After sub-grouping the study population into Omega-3 Index response groups , the group with a mean O3I of > 4 % after six months of n-3 PUFA treatment demonstrated the greatest TAG reduction .",3
A weak association between Omega-3 Index increase and TAG level decrease was found .,4
"This may be explained by highly fluctuating TAG levels , a large inter-individual difference in response of the Omega-3 Index , a cohort of subjects with only slightly elevated TAG levels and high Omega-3 Index values at baseline , and possibly to insufficient statistical power .",4
"Since there was no strong association between Omega-3 Index increase and the TAG level decrease , we conclude that changes in serum TAG levels are not a viable substitute for the Omega-3 Index to monitor treatment with EPA and DHA .",4
"At randomization , median oxygen flow was 9 L/min ( interquartile range , 5-15 ) in the noninvasive ventilation group and 9 L/min ( interquartile range , 6-15 ) in the oxygen group .",3
All patients in the noninvasive ventilation group received the first noninvasive ventilation session immediately after randomization .,3
"On day 28 after randomization , 46 deaths ( 24.1 % ) had occurred in the noninvasive ventilation group vs 50 ( 27.3 % ) in the oxygen group ( absolute difference , -3.2 [ 95 % CI , -12.1 to 5.6 ] ; P = .47 ) .",3
"Oxygenation failure occurred in 155 patients overall ( 41.4 % ) , 73 ( 38.2 % ) in the noninvasive ventilation group and 82 ( 44.8 % ) in the oxygen group ( absolute difference , -6.6 [ 95 % CI , -16.6 to 3.4 ] ; P = .20 ) .",3
"There were no significant differences in ICU-acquired infections , duration of mechanical ventilation , or lengths of ICU or hospital stays .",3
"Among immunocompromised patients admitted to the ICU with hypoxemic acute respiratory failure , early noninvasive ventilation compared with oxygen therapy alone did not reduce 28-day mortality .",4
"However , study power was limited .",4
Treatment with BCG Connaught conferred significantly greater 5-yr recurrence-free survival compared with treatment with BCG Tice ( p = 0.0108 ) .,4
Comparable numbers of patients experienced BCG therapy-related side effects in each treatment group ( p = 0.09 ) .,4
"In mice , BCG Connaught induced stronger T-helper cell 1-biased responses , greater priming of BCG-specific CD8 ( + ) T cells , and more robust T-cell recruitment to the bladder than BCG Tice .",4
Genome sequencing of the BCG strains revealed candidate genes potentially involved in the differential clinical responses .,4
BCG strain may have an impact on treatment outcome in NMIBC immunotherapy .,4
We compared the efficacy of two commonly used bacillus Calmette-Gurin ( BCG ) strains for the treatment of NMIBC and found that treatment with BCG Connaught prevented recurrences more efficiently than BCG Tice .,3
Comparison of the immunogenicity of the two strains in mice indicated superior immunogenicity of BCG Connaught .,3
We also identified genetic differences that may explain the differential efficacy of the Connaught and Tice BCG strains .,3
"The median overall survival improved from 5.3 months with placebo to 7.1 months with TAS-102 , and the hazard ratio for death in the TAS-102 group versus the placebo group was 0.68 ( 95 % confidence interval [ CI ] , 0.58 to 0.81 ; P < 0.001 ) .",3
"The most frequently observed clinically significant adverse events associated with TAS-102 were neutropenia , which occurred in 38 % of those treated , and leukopenia , which occurred in 21 % ; 4 % of the patients who received TAS-102 had febrile neutropenia , and one death related to TAS-102 was reported .",3
"The median time to worsening performance status ( a change in Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status [ on a scale of 0 to 5 , with 0 indicating no symptoms and higher numbers indicating increasing degrees of disability ] from 0 or 1 to 2 or more ) was 5.7 months with TAS-102 versus 4.0 months with placebo ( hazard ratio , 0.66 ; 95 % CI , 0.56 to 0.78 ; P < 0.001 ) .",3
"In patients with refractory colorectal cancer , TAS-102 , as compared with placebo , was associated with a significant improvement in overall survival .",4

"For craving , a mixed model ANCOVA showed a significant interaction of packaging and time of measurement ( F ( 2,94 ) = 8.77 , p < .001 , partial ( 2 ) = .16 ) .",3
There was no significant main effect or interaction for motivation to stop smoking ( p = .9 ) .,3
"The standardised pack was perceived to be significantly less appealing and less motivating to buy cigarettes , smokers using them were perceived as less popular and cigarettes from them expected to taste worse .",3
Standardised cigarette packaging may reduce acute ( hedonic ) craving and is associated with more negative perceptions than branded packaging with less prominent health warnings .,4

"Reflux and pneumonia incidences , mechanical ventilation duration , average ICU stay length , and nutritional support costs were significantly lower in the NIT group than in the NGT group ( p < 0.01 ) .",3
"Blind bedside NIT insertion is convenient and its use can effectively improve nutritional status , reduce feeding complications , and decrease nutritional support costs of critically ill patients .",4
Mean age was 33.5 ( 9.5 ) years in the placebo group and 33.8 ( 11.5 ) in the treatment group .,3
"There were 55 women and 18 men in the placebo group , and 46 women and 27 men in the treatment group .",3
Comparison of overall symptom scores in the two groups revealed a significantly greater reduction in the treatment group than in the placebo group ( p = 0.015 ) .,3
Analysis at the first 13 dose intervals ( 66h of treatment ) showed a greater reduction of symptom scores in the treatment group than in the placebo group ( p < 0.05 ) .,3

"We conducted a population-based case-control study of multiple health care databases in Ontario , Canada , from April 2002 to March 2012 .",3
Patients who were enrolled as cases were Ontarians aged 66 years or older hospitalized with hypomagnesemia .,3
"For each individual enrolled as a case , we identified up to four individuals as controls matched on age , sex , kidney disease , and use of various diuretic classes .",3
"Exposure to PPIs was categorized according to the most proximate prescription prior to the index date as current ( within 90 days ) , recent ( within 91 to 180 days ) , or remote ( within 181 to 365 days ) .",3
We used conditional logistic regression to estimate the odds ratio for the association of outpatient PPI use and hospitalization with hypomagnesemia .,3
"To test the specificity of our findings we examined use of histamine H2 receptor antagonists , drugs with no causal link to hypomagnesemia .",3
"We studied 366 patients hospitalized with hypomagnesemia and 1,464 matched controls .",3
"Current PPI use was associated with a 43 % increased risk of hypomagnesemia ( adjusted odds ratio , 1.43 ; 95 % CI 1.06-1 .93 ) .",3
"In a stratified analysis , the risk was particularly increased among patients receiving diuretics , ( adjusted odds ratio , 1.73 ; 95 % CI 1.11-2 .70 ) and not significant among patients not receiving diuretics ( adjusted odds ratio , 1.25 ; 95 % CI 0.81-1 .91 ) .",3
"We estimate that one excess hospitalization with hypomagnesemia will occur among 76,591 outpatients treated with a PPI for 90 days .",3
Hospitalization with hypomagnesemia was not associated with the use of histamine H2 receptor antagonists ( adjusted odds ratio 1.06 ; 95 % CI 0.54-2 .06 ) .,3
"Limitations of this study include a lack of access to serum magnesium levels , uncertainty regarding diagnostic coding of hypomagnesemia , and generalizability of our findings to younger patients .",3
PPIs are associated with a small increased risk of hospitalization with hypomagnesemia among patients also receiving diuretics .,4
"Physicians should be aware of this association , particularly for patients with hypomagnesemia .",4

Results obtained from the current novel research indicate a strong preventive effect of 10-day supplementation with saffron on the DOMS .,4
The saffron can be used to prevent DOMS and alleviate the DOMS symptoms .,4
The baseline deltamethrin concentration of 43 % of Netprotect nets were below the tolerance limit while 27 % of PermaNet 2.0 nets were above the target dose limits .,3
By 36 months Netprotect retained 35 % while PermaNet 2.0 retained 49 % of baseline insecticide dose .,3
Moreover the proportion of the inactive deltamethrin R-alpha isomer in the Netprotect nets was 33 % at the baseline and increased to 69 % after three years while it was low and almost constant for PermaNet 2.0 ( 3-7 % ) .,3
Only 71 % of Netprotect met the WHO criteria for bio-efficacy after three years while at least 80 % is required .,3
Moreover Netprotect nets failed for the WHOPES criteria after 12 and 24 months .,3
The reference LLIN met the WHOPES criteria throughout the study .,3
Over the entire three years the reference LLIN did obtain significant higher mosquito mortality than Netprotect .,3
"The physical integrity was based on the proportionate hole index and after three years , 25 % of Netprotect and 30 % of PermaNet 2.0 were in a mediocre or poor state .",3
"Netprotect did not meet the minimum WHO criteria for bio-efficacy after 12 , 24 and 36 months .",4
The use of a reference LLIN as positive control was helpful for data interpretation .,4
"However , for future three-year studies , it is essential that before initiating any study nets should be checked for their specifications and this for both the candidate LLIN as well as for the reference LLIN .",4
"Moreover , to improve the accuracy of the success rate of the candidate LLIN more nets should be tested for their bio-efficacy at the end of the trial .",4
No effect was found on the primary outcomes .,3
Blood pressure targets were reached in 39.8 % of patients in the intervention and 38.7 % of patients in the control group ; cholesterol target levels were reached in 44.5 % and 49.0 % respectively ; antiplatelet drugs were prescribed in 82.7 % in both groups .,3
"Six secondary outcomes improved : smoking status , exercise control , diet control , registration of alcohol intake , measurement of waist circumference , and fasting glucose .",3
Participants ' perceived goal attainment was high in both arms : mean scores of 7.9 and 8.2 on the 10-point scale .,3

"Emergence agitation scores , the incidence of emergence agitation and severe emergence agitation were significantly lower in groups D and F than in group S ( p = 0.021 , p = 0.018 , and p = 0.028 , respectively ) .",3
The postoperative pain scores were lower in groups D and F as compared to group S ( p = 0.01 ) .,3
"Awakening and extubation times in groups D and F were longer than that of group S ( p = 0.001 and p = 0.000 , respectively ) .",3
The overall incidence of postoperative complications was higher in group F compared to that in groups D and S ( p = 0.01 ) .,3
"In children undergoing adenotonsillectomy under sevoflurane anesthesia , a single IV injection of dezocine 0.1 mgxkg ( -1 ) and fentanyl 1 gkg ( -1 ) were comparable in decreasing the incidence and severity of emergence agitation .",4
"However , the use of dezocine was associated with a lower incidence of postoperative side effects .",4
"The proportions of patients who reached the primary end point were 55 % and 65 % for the 40-mg and 160-mg mongersen groups , respectively , as compared with 10 % for the placebo group ( P < 0.001 ) .",3
There was no significant difference in the percentage of participants reaching clinical remission between the 10-mg group ( 12 % ) and the placebo group .,3
"The rate of clinical response was significantly greater among patients receiving 10 mg ( 37 % ) , 40 mg ( 58 % ) , or 160 mg ( 72 % ) of mongersen than among those receiving placebo ( 17 % ) ( P = 0.04 , P < 0.001 , and P < 0.001 , respectively ) .",3
Most adverse events were related to complications and symptoms of Crohn 's disease .,3

The immediate analgesia effect in the fire filiform needle group was obviously superior to that in the medicine group in the first three times of treatment ( all P < 0.05 ) .,3
"The average time of pain relief was ( 3.91 + / - 0.82 ) days in the fire filiform needle group , which was significantly earlier to ( 6.53 + / - 1.13 ) days in the medicine group ( P < 0.05 ) .",3
"26 cases were cured in the fire filiform needle group in the follow-up visit , which was superior to 2 cases in the medicine group ( P < 0.05 ) .",3

There was only one case of adverse effect in the medicine group during the treatment .,3
"The fire filiform needle combined with mild moxibustion could obviously relieve the pain in PHN patients , which has superior immediate analgesia effect and pain relieving time compared with gabapentin , which also has less adverse effects and cheap cost .",4
"Serum adalimumab levels measured 2 weeks after the last adalimumab administration ranged from < 0.002 to 23.0 g/ml , with a median of 11.5 g/ml .",3
These levels were associated with neither response to treatment or disease activity measurements at the end of treatment nor with the occurrence of relapse and time to relapse after discontinuation of treatment .,3
"Antiadalimumab ADAbs were present in 23 % of the patients at end of treatment and in 35 % at follow-up after treatment discontinuation , indicating that ADAbs were masked by the presence of the drug in some patients .",3
"However , ADAbs at the end of treatment and at follow-up were not different between responders and nonresponders and were not associated with relapse upon discontinuation of treatment .",3
There is no clear association between adalimumab serum levels or antiadalimumab ADAbs with clinical response to treatment or with relapse upon treatment discontinuation in pSpA .,4
"Individuals with pathological gambling or cocaine dependence compared to those with neither disorder exhibited exaggerated anticipatory activity in mesolimbic and ventrocortical regions , with pathological-gambling participants displaying greater positive possible-reward anticipation and cocaine-dependent participants displaying more negative certain-loss anticipation .",3
Neither clinical sample exhibited medial frontal or striatal responses that were observed following near-miss outcomes in healthy comparison participants .,3
Alterations in anticipatory processing may be sensitive to the valence of rewards and content-disorder-specific .,4
Common and unique findings in pathological gambling and cocaine dependence with respect to anticipatory reward and near-miss loss processing suggest shared and unique elements that might be targeted through behavioral or pharmacological interventions in the treatment of addictions .,4

"Sixty-five percent of the patients ' recordings were unscorable based on accepted standardized criteria ; therefore , sleep measures could not be compared .",3
"For those with sleep that could be scored , total sleep time was normal , although sleep was fragmented and time spent in slow-wave or rapid eye movement sleep was notably decreased .",3
"Patients with unscorable recordings had worse injury severity measures , absent or significantly slower posterior dominant rhythm , and less coherence of posterior faster frequencies .",3
Clinical outcomes were similar between intervention and control groups .,3
"Although sleep-promoting interventions were feasible , sleep quantification based on currently accepted criteria limited the ability to score sleep .",4

"Seeking evidence for a possibly effective adjunct to traditional behavioral approaches for treatment of MA dependence , this study is assessing the ability of an 8-week aerobic and resistance exercise protocol to reduce relapse to MA use during a 12-week follow-up period after discharge from residential-based treatment .",4
The study also is evaluating improvements in health and functional outcomes during and after the protocol .,4
This paper describes the design and methods of the study .,4
The short-term efficacy of NP group was similar to that of TP group .,3
"The 3-year overall survival rates , disease-free-survival rates , locoregional relapse-free survival rates and distant metastasis-free survival rates in the NP and TP groups were 84.2 % and 82.9 % , 71.1 % and 74.3 % , 89.5 % and 91.4 % , 81.6 % and 77.1 % , respectively ( P > 0.05 ) .",3
"The occurrence rates of leucopenia , anemia and acute mucositis were significantly higher in the TP group than those in the NP group ( P < 0.05 ) .",3
"The gastrointestinal toxicity , dermatitis and liver toxicity were similar in the two groups .",3
The efficacy of NP regimen induction chemotherapy plus concurrent chemordiotherapy for advanced NPC is similar to that of TP regimen .,4
"The toxicity of the NP regimen is lower than that of NP regimen , tolerable , and with a good compliance .",4
This trial will be the first to compare CBT with TAU under rigorous conditions within routine care and with a complex sample .,4
"Furthermore , cost-effectiveness of treatment and cost-of-illness of clinical depression are established which will provide new insights on depression as a disorder and its treatment .",4
None of the patients developed an acute kidney injury during the study and no significant differences were found between the serum neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin levels of the groups during the perioperative period .,3
"The choice of anesthetic drug , either propofol or sevoflurane , did not affect the serum levels of neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin during the perioperative period in laparoscopic bariatric surgery .",4
"The patients were 60 10 ( mean SD ) years old , and had HbA1c value 7.3 0.9 % .",3
"The pre-meal glucose levels before lunch were significantly lower with mitiglinide than with sitagliptin ( 116 26/131 34 mg/dl , p = 0.022 ) .",3
"The AUC measuring over 140 mg/dl 3 h after breakfast ( mitiglinide 4812 4219/sitagliptin 7807 6391 mg/dlmin , p = 0.042 ) and lunch ( mitiglinide 5658 5856/sitagliptin 8492 7161 , p = 0.050 ) was significantly lower with mitiglinide than with sitagliptin .",3
"A CGM-based comparison showed that mitiglinide and sitagliptin were different in their glucose-lowering effects , where mitiglinide significantly improved hyperglycemia after breakfast and lunch , and significantly lowered pre-meal glucose levels before lunch , compared to sitagliptin .",4
"ICD patients were randomized 2:1 to automatic HM or to Conventional monitoring , with follow-up checks scheduled at 3 , 6 , 9 , 12 , and 15 months post-implant .",3
Conventional patients were evaluated with IPE only .,3
Home Monitoring patients were assessed remotely only for 1 year between 3 and 15 month evaluations .,3
Adherence to follow-up was measured .,3
"HM and Conventional patients were similar ( age 63 years , 72 % male , left ventricular ejection fraction 29 % , primary prevention 73 % , DDD 57 % ) .",3
"Conventional management suffered greater patient attrition during the trial ( 20.1 vs. 14.2 % in HM , P = 0.007 ) .",3
Three month follow-up occurred in 84 % in both groups .,3
There was 100 % adherence ( 5 of 5 checks ) in 47.3 % Conventional vs. 59.7 % HM ( P < 0.001 ) .,3
"Between 3 and 15 months , HM exhibited superior ( 2.2 ) adherence to scheduled follow-up [ incidence of failed follow up was 146 of 2421 ( 6.0 % ) in HM vs. 145 of 1098 ( 13.2 % ) in Conventional , P < 0.001 ] and punctuality .",3
"In HM ( daily transmission success rate median 91 % ) , transmission loss caused only 22 of 2275 ( 0.97 % ) failed HM evaluations between 3 and 15 months ; others resulted from clinic oversight .",3
"Overall IPE failure rate in Conventional [ 193 of 1841 ( 10.5 % ) exceeded that in HM [ 97 of 1484 ( 6.5 % ) , P < 0.001 ] by 62 % , i.e. HM patients remained more loyal to IPE when this was mandated .",3
Automatic remote monitoring better preserves patient retention and adherence to scheduled follow-up compared with IPE .,4
"Overall 50 and 53 patients were included in the holmium laser enucleation and photoselective vapo-enucleation of the prostate groups , respectively .",3
"Operative time , hospital stay and time to catheter removal were comparable between the groups .",3
"There was significant , comparable improvement in I-PSS and post-void residual urine volume at 1 , 4 and 12 months .",3
"After 4 months prostate size reduction was significantly higher in the holmium laser enucleation of prostate group ( 74.3 % vs 43.1 % , p = 0.001 ) .",3
"At 12 months maximum urine flow rate was significantly higher in the holmium laser enucleation of prostate group ( 26.4 11.5 vs 18.4 7.5 ml per second , p = 0.03 ) .",3
"Re-intervention was needed in 2 and 3 cases in the holmium laser enucleation and photoselective vapo-enucleation of the prostate groups , respectively ( p = 1.0 ) .",3
Mean estimated cost per holmium laser enucleation of prostate procedure was significantly lower than per photoselective vapo-enucleation of the prostate procedure .,3
"Compared to holmium laser enucleation of prostate , GreenLight XPS laser photoselective vapo-enucleation of the prostate is safe , noninferior and effective in treatment of benign prostatic hyperplasia .",4
"A preplanned Data Safety Monitoring Board analysis of 30 of 48 randomized patients who completed the study revealed that the primary endpoint of hyponatremia correction was met by 16 of 17 patients who received tolvaptan and by 1 of 13 patients who received placebo ( 94 % vs 8 % ; P < .001 ) , which met the study stopping rule for superiority .",3
"The secondary endpoints between the tolvaptan and placebo groups ( meanstandard deviation ) for length of stay ( 2115 days vs 2615 days , respectively ) and change in the Mini-Mental State Examination score ( -0.351.66 vs 0.312.42 , respectively ) were not significantly different .",3
"No overcorrection of serum sodium ( > 12 mmol/L per day ) was noted in the tolvaptan group , and the main adverse events noted were dry mouth , polydipsia , and polyuria , leading to 13 % study withdrawal .",3
"Although tolvaptan was effective for correcting hyponatremia in patients with cancer , studies with a larger sample size will be required to confirm the current findings , including the outcomes of secondary endpoints .",4
There are no statistical differences between two groups in pain scores .,3
No adverse events including respiratory depression occurred throughout the study in both groups .,3
"Remifentanil infusion at 0.02 microg x kg ( -1 ) x min ( -1 ) can safely be used without any serious adverse events , while it may not be enough for postoperative analgesia .",4
The best dosage of this drug for postoperative analgesia remains to be elucidated .,4
"Of the 50 subjects in the study 16 ( 32 % ) each were in the cream and rattle groups , while the rest ( 36 % ) were in the control group .",3
"The severity of the pain before intervention in the control , cream and rattle groups was 2.22 + / - 0.88 , 2.12 + / - 0.95 and 2.25 + / - 1.06 respectively , which were not statistically significant ( p < 0.93 ) .",3
"Likewise , the mean severity of pain at the moment of intervention in the three above groups were 8.67 + / - 0.77 , 7.12 + / - 0.5 and 7.87 + / - 0.96 respectively , which was significantly different ( p < 0.001 ) .",3
"The severity of pain 15seconds after the intervention in the groups was 5.06 + / - 1.51 , 4.87 + / - 1.31 and 4.19 + / - 1.94 respectively , which were not statistically different ( p < 0.27 ) .",3
"The eutectic mixture of local anaesthetics cream and shaking rattle were effective in attenuating pain of vaccination among the infants , but the latter was not as significant as the former .",4
"The final intent-to-treat population comprised 471 patients ( 238 [ 9 mg OD ] , 233 [ 3 mg TID ] ) .",3
"The confirmatory population for the primary endpoint analysis was the interim per protocol population ( n = 377 ; 188 [ 9 mg OD ] , 189 [ 3mg TID ] ) , in which the primary endpoint was statistically non-inferior with budesonide 9 mg OD versus 3 mg TID .",3
"Clinical remission was achieved in 71.3 % versus 75.1 % , a difference of -3.9 % ( 95 % CI [ -14.6 % ; 6.4 % ] ; p = 0.020 for non-inferiority ) .",3
"The mean ( SD ) time to remission was 21.9 ( 13.8 ) days versus 21.4 ( 14.6 ) days with budesonide 9 mg OD versus 3 mg TID , respectively .",3
"In a subpopulation of 122 patients with baseline SES-CD ulcer score 1 , complete mucosal healing occurred in 32.8 % ( 21/64 ) on 9 mg OD and 41.4 % ( 24/58 ) on 3mg TID ; deep remission ( mucosal healing and clinical remission ) was observed in 26.6 % ( 17/64 ) and 32.8 % ( 19/58 ) of patients , respectively .",3
Treatment-emergent suspected adverse drug reactions were reported in 4.6 % of 9 mg OD and 4.7 % of 3 mg TID patients .,3
Budesonide at the recommended dose of 9 mg/day can be administered OD without impaired efficacy and safety compared to 3mg TID dosing in mild-to-moderately active Crohn 's disease .,4
Findings suggested that dissociation at the time of the 1st treatment session was associated with reduced response to the early intervention .,3
No other predictors were associated with treatment response .,3
"For treatment as usual , cortisol levels at the time of acute care and dissociation at the time of the traumatic event were positively associated with PTSD symptoms .",3
Dissociation at the time at which treatment starts may indicate poorer response to early intervention for PTSD .,4
"Similarly , dissociation at the time of the event was positively related to PTSD symptoms in those who received treatment as usual .",4
A total of 550 patients were included in our study in a 2-month study period .,3
"There were no significant differences between patients in terms of sex , age , weight , height , body mass index , and wrist circumference .",3
"In addition , the number of attempts ( P = .489 ) , patients ' pain level during the procedure ( P = .145 ) , and the degree of difficulty of the procedure according to the patient ( P = .109 ) and physician ( P = .554 ) were not significantly different between the groups .",3
"After arterial blood gas extraction procedure , 115 patients ( 20.9 % ) developed complications .",3
"In the conventional heparinized syringe group , the complication rate ( n = 69 ; 25.1 % ) was significantly higher compared with the group that used safety-engineered blood gas syringes ( n = 46 ; 16 % ; P = .0211 ) .",3
"Localized pain , which is one of the most common early complications , was more frequent in the conventional heparinized syringe group ( 19.3 % ) .",3
"Complications in women ( P = .003 ) and local pain ( P = .01 ) developed lesser in the second group that used safety-engineered blood gas syringes , and the patient-physician satisfaction was higher in that group , as well .",3
"In the evaluation 48 hours after the procedure , the ratios of infection and local hematoma were higher in the conventional heparinized syringe group ( P = .0213 and P < .0001 ) .",3
"In this study , we did not find any significant differences between the conventional heparinized syringes and safety-engineered blood gas syringes in terms of ease of operation , physician and patient satisfaction , and appropriateness of the taken sample .",4
"However , patients whose arterial blood gas was extracted by using safety-engineered blood gas syringes felt less pain and experienced fewer infections and hematomas at their puncture site .",4
The present study revealed that zinc supplementation significantly increased the proportion of monocytes expressing transmembrane TNF - .,3
"While the plasma TNF - levels and TNF - expressing lymphocytes were not significantly altered in the zinc-treated and placebo groups , higher proportion of TNF - bound monocytes were observed in the zinc-treated group .",3
"Because functional transmembrane TNF - was shown to be implicated in defense mechanisms , these findings suggest that zinc supplementation may benefit immune response against cancer in patients with DM and metabolic syndrome .",4
"Semi-automated volumetric measurements of functional parameters ( ADC , AE , and VE ) before and after IAT as well as change in tumor ADC , AE , or VE had better interobserver agreement ( ICC = 0.830-0 .974 ) compared with manual ROI-based axial measurements ( ICC = 0.157-0 .799 ) .",3
"Semi-automated measurements of tumor volume and size in the axial plane before and after IAT had better interobserver agreement ( ICC = 0.854-0 .996 ) compared with manual size measurements ( ICC = 0.543-0 .596 ) , and interobserver agreement for change in tumor RECIST size was also higher using semi-automated measurements ( ICC = 0.655 ) compared with manual measurements ( ICC = 0.169 ) .",3
"EASL measurements of tumor enhancement in the axial plane before and after IAT ( ( ICC = 0.758-0 .809 ) , and changes in EASL after IAT ( ICC = 0.653 ) had good interobserver agreement .",3
"Semi-automated measurements of functional changes assessed by ADC and VE based on whole-lesion segmentation demonstrated better reproducibility than ROI-based axial measurements , or RECIST or EASL measurements .",4
"We observed very small , nonsignificant changes in fructosamine ( telemonitoring , -54.9 mol ; usual care , -59.4 mol ) and systolic BP ( telemonitoring , -6.3 mm Hg ; usual care , -3.2 mm Hg ) from baseline to 6 weeks in both groups .",3
"At 6 months , we observed no significant intergroup differences in change from baseline for HbA1c , fructosamine , or self-efficacy .",3
"However , LDL cholesterol in the telemonitoring arm decreased more than in the usual care arm ( -17.1 mg/dL versus -5.4 mg/dL ; P = 0.045 ) .",3
"Although HbA1c improved significantly over 6 months in both groups , the difference in improvement between the groups was not significant .",4
"This lack of significance may be due to the relatively healthy status of the volunteers in our study and to the high level of care provided by the care managers in the Santa Rosa , CA clinic .",4
Further study in subgroups of less healthy diabetes patients is recommended .,4
"There were no significant differences between the two meals for ratings in perceived satiety , fullness , appetite and mood states .",3
"During steady-state exercise , there were no significant differences in metabolic and physiological measures .",3
"In the time-trial , distance ran was significantly lower in LGI versus CON meal trial , but with a corresponding lower perceived exertion in the LGI trial .",3
"Compared to CON , ingesting LGI as the sahur meal did not provide any metabolic , physiological or performance benefits during endurance run performed 12h post-prandial in Ramadan fasted state .",4
The exponential demand equation fit the purchase task data well across subjects and time .,3
"As predicted , demand intensity decreased and sensitivity to price ( elasticity ) increased over time .",3
"However , changes in demand intensity did not differ by treatment group .",3
"Contrary to our hypothesis that varenicline would increase sensitivity to price , the placebo group tended to become more elastic in their purchases during Weeks 2 and 3 ; the groups did not differ in elasticity at Week 4 .",3
"Breakpoint did not vary by group , time , or their interaction .",3
Simulated smoking demand can be validly assessed in the natural environment of treatment-seeking smokers .,4
Simulated demand indices of smoking reinforcement diminished as smokers approached their target quit date .,4
"However , there was no evidence that varenicline facilitated these changes over a three-week period , leaving open the mechanisms by which varenicline reduces smoking rate prior to cessation and improves long-term abstinence .",4
"A total of 81 patients were randomized in the initial supplementation study , 39 of whom received Se ( selenium group , SeG ) and 42 of whom served as controls ( control group , CG ) .",3
"When former patients were reidentified after a median follow-up of 70 months ( range = 0-136 ) , the actuarial 10-year disease-free survival rate in the SeG was 80.1 % compared to 83.2 % in the CG ( P = .65 ) , and the actuarial 10-year overall survival rate of patients in the SeG was 55.3 % compared to 42.7 % in the CG ( P = .09 ) .",3
Our extended follow-up analysis demonstrates that Se supplementation had no influence on the effectiveness of the anticancer irradiation therapy and did not negatively affect patients ' long-term survival .,4
"In view of its positive effects on RT-induced diarrhea , we consider Se supplementation to be a meaningful and beneficial adjuvant treatment in Se-deficient cervical and uterine cancer patients while undergoing pelvic radiation therapy .",4
Gastric emptying rate and satiety feelings were not affected by duration of MSF ( P 0.27 ) .,3
"However , the 700-kcal GL treatments slowed gastric emptying [ 41 % lower area under the curve ( AUC ) ] and increased satiety feelings ( 22-31 % higher AUC ) compared with the 100-kcal GL treatments ( P < 0.001 ) .",3
No interaction between MSF duration and energy density of GL was found ( P 0.44 ) .,3
Higher gastric energy density inhibited gastric emptying and increased satiety feelings in healthy young men .,4
"However , prolonging oral exposure to food did not have an additional effect .",4
This study provides more insight in satiety regulation .,4
This trial was registered at trialregister.nl as NTR3601 .,4
"Patients will be evaluated at 1 , 6 and 12 months after stenting .",3
"The primary outcomes are the in-stent restenosis rate , new stroke or aggravation of the previous ischemic stroke ipsilateral to the severe stenotic artery .",3
"Secondary outcomes include stroke of other artery territories , myocardial infarction and vascular death .",3
"Modification of stroke knowledge , exercise and diet habit , smoking cessation and available laboratory data will also be recorded .",3
"As our pilot study , tissue kallikrein would be expected to prevent the long-term in-stent restenosis after stenting of the symptomatic middle cerebral artery dramatically .",4
Thirty-three patients were lost to follow-up .,3
Forty six patients reached the primary end point during the follow-up period ( Median 39 months ) .,3
"Kaplan-Meier analysis showed a significantly higher risk of development of the primary end points in patients with skin autofluorescence levels above the optimal cut-off level of 2.31 arbitrary units , derived by receiver operator curve analysis .",3
"Cox regression analysis revealed that skin autofluorescence was an independent predictor of the primary end point , even after adjustment for age , gender , smoking history , diabetes , estimated glomerular filtration rate and proteinuria ( adjusted hazard ratio 2.58 , P = 0.004 ) .",3
"Tissue accumulation of AGEs , measured as skin autofluorescence , is a strong and independent predictor of progression of CKD .",4
Skin autofluorescence may be useful for risk stratification in this group of patients ; further studies should clarify whether AGE accumulation could be one of the therapeutic targets to improve the prognosis of CKD .,4
Two hundred five patients were enrolled and randomized to receive either a single ( n = 103 ) or multidose antibiotic regimen ( n = 102 ) for prophylaxis .,3
The incidences of SSI and urinary tract infection were similar in both groups .,3
"As the dramatic increase in antibiotic resistance has mandated the implementation of global programs to optimize the use of antibiotic agents in humans , we believe that the single dose regimen is preferred , at least in nondiabetic , non-morbidly obese , adult renal transplant recipients .",4
Prevalence of binge eating at baseline was 19.4 % ( n = 76 ) .,3
Prevalence of binge eating at any time point was 30.1 % ( n = 126 ) .,3
"Although rate of weight regain did not differ significantly between those who did or did not report binge eating at baseline , binge eating behavior across the study period ( additive value of presence or absence at each time point ) was significantly associated with different rates of weight regain .",3
Tailoring weight loss maintenance interventions to address binge eating behavior is warranted given the prevalence and the different rates of weight regain experienced by those reporting this behavior .,4
The increased detection of CIN2 + in the intervention arm decreased over time .,3
"After six years , the cumulative incidence of CIN3 + was similar in both trial arms , and after 11 years the cumulative incidence of CIN2 + became similar in both arms .",3
The longitudinal sensitivity of cytology for CIN2 + in the control arm at three years was similar to the sensitivity of HPV testing in the intervention arm at five years of follow-up : 85.94 % ( 95 % confidence interval 76.85 % to 91.84 % ) v 86.40 % ( 79.21 % to 91.37 % ) .,3
The sensitivity of HPV screening for CIN3 + after five years was 89.34 % ( 80.10 % to 94.58 % ) and for cytology after three years was 92.02 % ( 80.59 % to 96.97 % ) .,3
"Over long term follow-up , the cumulative incidence of CIN2 + was the same for HPV screening and for cytology , implying that the increased sensitivity of HPV screening for CIN2 + reflects earlier detection rather than overdiagnosis .",4
"The low long term risks of CIN3 + among women who tested negative in HPV screening , support screening intervals of five years for such women .",4
"Sex modified the relationship between perceived neighborhood drug involvement and past month tobacco use , and the association was significant among women only ( aOR = 1.49 ; 95 % CI = 1.19-1 .88 ) .",3
"Perceptions of neighborhood social cohesion ( aOR = 0.97 ; 95 % CI = 0.83-1 .13 ) , and objective neighborhood disorder ( aOR = 1.17 ; 95 % CI = 0.98-1 .38 ) were not significantly associated with past month tobacco use .",3
"Understanding the correlation between perceived and objective neighborhood disorder , and their independent association with tobacco use can potentially lead to environmentally based interventions aimed at reducing tobacco use among young adults who live in urban environments .",4
"Of the 155 patients recruited in the prenatal period , only 20 ( 12.9 % ) were eventually randomised at birth .",3
"The main reasons for the high loss were that women either did not have a vaginal delivery ( 38 , 24.5 % ) , or they did not need an episiotomy ( 72 , 46.5 % ) .",3
Rates of obstetric anal sphincter injury and other outcomes were similar between groups .,3
Anal sphincter injury during childbirth remains an important problem .,4
"Although the use of curved scissors provides a theoretical solution , we found that the high attrition rate made feasibility of conducting a suitably powered , randomised trial using the current design untenable .",4
Alternative strategies have been suggested to make any future study more viable .,4
"Median reductions in serum HBV DNA levels at 52 weeks ( log 10 copies/mL ) were as follows : LAM , 3.98 ; ETV , 3.89 ; LDT , 4.11 ; and CLA , 3.36 .",3
"The corresponding HBV DNA undetectability rates were 83 % , 96 % , 91 % , and 89 % , respectively .",3
These two measures showed no significant intergroup differences .,3
Clinical efficacy appeared related to HBV DNA level reduction after 24 weeks of therapy .,3
"Patients were divided into three groups based on HBV DNA levels at week 24 : Undetectable ( < 10 ( 3 ) copies/mL ) , detectable but < 10 ( 4 ) copies/mL , and > 10 ( 4 ) copies/mL .",3
"Patients with levels below quantitation limit ( QL ) were analyzed at 52 weeks for HBV DNA undetectability rate ( 94 % ) , ALT normalization rate ( 83 % ) , and viral breakthrough rate ( 0 % ) .",3
"The corresponding values in the QL-10 ( 4 ) copies/mL group were 50 % , 75 % , and 13 % , whereas those in the above 10 ( 4 ) copies/mL group were 53 % , 65 % , and 18 % .",3
There were significant differences at week 52 for HBV DNA levels and viral breakthrough rate between the three groups .,3
Different nucleos ( t ) ide ( NUC ) analogues tested exhibited no significant differences in effectiveness for Chinese NUC-naive HBV patients during 1-year treatment period .,4
"There were no significant differences in age , gender , duration of dialysis , and causative factor for dialysis between both groups ( P > 0.05 ) .",3
"The mean of IL-8 and TNF - after the intervention in case group was 26.20 15.34 and 21.25 9.61 , respectively ; the difference between both groups was not statistically significant ( P > 0.05 ) .",3
"Based on the better feeling and other beneficial effects of ALA were found in our study ; we can conclude that it is a beneficial and recommended supplement , especially , for diabetic and dialysis patients .",4
"Overall , 301 patients were evaluated for inclusion in the study and 225 were randomized .",3
VTE occurred in 11 of 113 patients randomized to short ( 9.7 % ) and in none of the 112 patients randomized to extended heparin prophylaxis ( P = 0.001 ) .,3
"The incidence of VTE at 3 months was 9.7 % and 0.9 % in patients randomized to short or to extended heparin prophylaxis , respectively ( relative risk reduction : 91 % , 95 % confidence interval : 30 % -99 % ; P = 0.005 ) .",3
The rate of bleeding was similar in the 2 treatment groups .,3
"Two patients died during the study period , 1 in each treatment group .",3
"After laparoscopic surgery for colorectal cancer , extended antithrombotic prophylaxis is safe and reduces the risk for VTE as compared with 1-week prophylaxis ( NCT01589146 ) .",4
"One-time ingestion of apple juice significantly decreased the area under the plasma concentration-time curve ( AUC0-24 ) for ( R ) - and ( S ) - fexofenadine by 49 and 59 % , respectively , and prolonged the time to reach the maximum plasma concentration ( t max ) of both enantiomers ( P < 0.001 ) .",3
"Although apple juice greatly reduced the amount of ( R ) - and ( S ) - fexofenadine excretion into urine ( Ae0-24 ) by 54 and 58 % , respectively , the renal clearances of both enantiomers were unchanged between the control and apple juice phases .",3
"For in vitro uptake studies , the uptake of both fexofenadine enantiomers into OATP2B1 complementary RNA ( cRNA ) - injected oocytes was significantly higher than that into water-injected oocytes , and this effect was greater for ( R ) - fexofenadine .",3
"In addition , apple juice significantly decreased the uptake of both enantiomers into OATP2B1 cRNA-injected oocytes .",3
These results suggest that OATP2B1 plays an important role in the stereoselective pharmacokinetics of fexofenadine and that one-time apple juice ingestion probably inhibits intestinal OATP2B1-mediated transport of both enantiomers .,4
"In addition , this study demonstrates that the OATP2B1 inhibition effect does not require repeated ingestion or a large volume of apple juice .",4
A total of 347 patients were enrolled .,3
"Of the 344 eligible patients , 319 ( 93 % ) achieved complete remission .",3
"After completing three courses of consolidation therapy , 269 patients underwent maintenance random assignment .",3
"The relapse-free survival ( RFS ) rate at 4 years was 84 % for the ATRA arm and 91 % for the tamibarotene arm ( hazard ratio [ HR ] , 0.54 ; 95 % CI , 0.26 to 1.13 ) .",3
"When the analysis was restricted to 52 high-risk patients with an initial WBC count 10.0 10 ( 9 ) / L , the intergroup difference was statistically significant , with 4-year RFS rates of 58 % for the ATRA arm and 87 % for the tamibarotene arm ( HR , 0.26 ; 95 % CI , 0.07 to 0.95 ) .",3
"For patients with non-high-risk disease , the HR was 0.82 ( 95 % CI , 0.32 to 2.01 ) .",3
The test for interaction between treatment effects and these subgroups resulted in P = .075 .,3
Both treatments were generally well tolerated .,3
"In this trial , no difference was detected between ATRA and tamibarotene for maintenance therapy .",4
"In an exploratory analysis , there was a suggestion of improved efficacy of tamibarotene in high-risk patients , but this requires further study .",4
"There was a large positive increase in the self-perceived competence of weighing patient preferences , appropriateness , and costs of medical care in the intervention group ( n = 71 ) ( effect sizes of 0.7 , 1.0 , and 1.2 , respectively ) , which was significantly better for the last 2 aspects than in the control group ( n = 63 ) .",3
The intervention group performed better on cost consciousness .,3
"Although the self-perceived knowledge increased substantially on some geriatric topics , this improvement was not different between the intervention and control groups .",3
"After playing the serious game , GeriatriX , medical students have a higher self-perceived competence in weighing patient preferences , appropriateness , and costs of medical care in complex geriatric medical decision making .",4
Playing GeriatriX also resulted in better cost consciousness .,4
We therefore encourage wider use of GeriatriX to teach geriatrics in medical curricula and its further research on educational and health care outcomes .,4
"Fifty-three patients ( 25 in SB group and 28 in DB group ) who were followed up for a minimum of 3 years ( mean , 69 months ; range , 36 to 140 months ) were evaluated .",3
"Preoperatively , there were no differences between the groups .",3
"Postoperatively , the Lachman and pivot-shift test results were better in the DB group ( P = .024 and P < .0001 , respectively ) .",3
"KT measurements were better in the DB group ( mean , 1.4 mm v 2.7 mm ; P = .0023 ) .",3
The Tegner score was also better in the DB group ( P = .033 ) .,3
"There were no significant differences in range of motion , muscle strength , Lysholm score , subjective rating scale , graft retear , and secondary meniscal tear .",3
"In ACL reconstruction using the transtibial approach , DB reconstruction was significantly better than SB reconstruction regarding anterior and rotational stability during the 3 - to 12-year follow-up .",4
"The results of KT measurements and the Lachman and pivot-shift tests were significantly better in the DB group , whereas there was no difference in the anterior drawer test results .",4
"The Tegner score was also better in the DB group ; however , there were no differences in the other subjective findings .",4
Qualifying VH-IVUS data from 91 patients were included in the final analysis .,3
"There were no significant differences between group and with respect to the primary endpoint , nominal change in normalized total atheroma volume ( TAV ) of the index intermediate coronary lesion ( -12.617.7 vs. -14.220.2 mm ( 3 ) , p = 0.691 ) , or plaque composition .",3
Plaque regression was observed in more than 70 % of patients in both groups .,3
"Diabetes was the only significant independent determinant of changes in TAV ( = 0.22 , p = 0.037 ) .",3
"There were greater decreases in total cholesterol ( -51.833.0 vs. -25.439.1 mg/dL , p0 .001 ) and LDL ( -33.530.5 vs. -20.330.8 mg/dL , p = 0.044 ) levels in group than in group .",3
"However , HDL cholesterol ( -11.28.5 vs. 2.77.7 mg/dL , p0 .001 ) and apoA1 ( -18.221.4 vs. 10.016.5 mg/dL , p0 .001 ) levels were also significantly decreased in group compared with group .",3
There were no significant differences in changes in plaque volume or composition between the cilostazol and probucol combination therapy and cilostazol monotherapy group despite different impacts of the treatments on lipid biomarkers .,4
Most participants with PD did not have a consistent two-cough response to 200 M capsaicin .,3
"UTC ratings and total number of coughs produced at 200 M capsaicin were significantly influenced by dysphagia severity but not by general PD severity , age , or disease duration .",3
Increasing levels of dysphagia severity resulted in significantly blunted cough sensitivity ( UTC ) .,3
UTC ratings may be important in understanding the mechanism underlying morbidity related to aspiration pneumonia in people with PD and dysphagia .,4
Further understanding of decreased UTC in people with PD and dysphagia will be essential for the development of strategies and treatments to address airway protection deficits in this population .,4
Adults and children clinically diagnosed with uncomplicated enteric fever were enrolled in the study to receive gatifloxacin ( 10 mg/kg/day ) in a single dose or ofloxacin ( 20 mg/kg/day ) in two divided doses for 7 days .,3
Patients were followed for six months .,3
The primary outcome was treatment failure in patients infected with nalidixic acid resistant isolates .,3
627 patients with a median age of 17 ( IQR 9-23 ) years were randomised .,3
"Of the 218 patients with culture confirmed enteric fever , 170 patients were infected with nalidixic acid-resistant isolates .",3
"In the ofloxacin group , 6 out of 83 patients had treatment failure compared to 5 out of 87 in the gatifloxacin group ( hazard ratio [ HR ] of time to failure 0.81 , 95 % CI 0.25 to 2.65 , p = 0.73 ) .",3
"The median time to fever clearance was 4.70 days ( IQR 2.98-5 .90 ) in the ofloxacin group versus 3.31 days ( IQR 2.29-4 .75 ) in the gatifloxacin group ( HR = 1.59 , 95 % CI 1.16 to 2.18 , p = 0.004 ) .",3
The results in all blood culture-confirmed patients and all randomized patients were comparable .,3
"Gatifloxacin was not superior to ofloxacin in preventing failure , but use of gatifloxacin did result in more prompt fever clearance time compared to ofloxacin .",4
"This trial will provide much-needed information on the potential relationships among safety planning , improved mental health , reduced violence as well as decreased decisional conflict related to safety in the abusive relationship .",4
"The novel web-based safety decision aid intervention may provide a cost-effective , easily accessed safety-planning resource that can be translated into clinical and community practice by multiple health disciplines and advocates .",4
The trial will also provide information about how women in abusive relationships safely access safety information and resources through the Internet .,4
"Finally , the trial will inform other research teams on the feasibility and acceptability of fully automated recruitment , eligibility screening , consent and retention procedures .",4
Clinical evaluations revealed that improvement from pre-operation to 24months post-operation occurred in both groups ( p < 0.05 ) .,3
"At all follow-up intervals , m-AMI demonstrated significantly better functional outcomes ( motion deficit and straight leg raise strength ) than did m-ACI ( p < 0.05 ) .",3
"At all follow-up intervals , m-AMI demonstrated significantly better subjective sub-scale scores for pain , symptoms , activities of daily living and sport and recreation of the knee injury and osteoarthritis outcome score ( KOOS ) than did m-ACI ( p < 0.05 ) .",3
"Additionally , m-AMI demonstrated significantly better ( p < 0.05 ) scores than m-ACI for the quality of life sub-scale of the KOOS and visual analog scale ( VAS ) severity at the 6-month follow-up .",3
The Tegner activity score and VAS frequency were not significantly different between the two groups .,3
Graft failure was not observed on magnetic resonance imaging at the 24-month follow-up .,3
"m-AMI and m-ACI demonstrated very good-to-excellent and good-to-very good infill , respectively , with no adverse effects from the implant , regardless of the treatment .",3
"For the treatment of isolated full-thickness chondral lesion of the knee , m-AMI can be used effectively and may potentially accelerate recovery .",4
A larger patient cohort and follow-up supported by histological analyses are necessary to determine long-term outcomes .,4
"Mean drusen cube root volumes were 0.49 mm and 0.47 mm ( P = .64 ) at baseline and 0.51 mm and 0.42 mm ( P = .17 ) at 26 weeks in the eculizumab and placebo groups , respectively .",3
"In the placebo group , one eye had a decrease in drusen volume of at least 50 % and two eyes developed neovascularization through 26 weeks .",3
Systemic complement inhibition with eculizumab did not significantly reduce drusen volume .,4
Drusen growth was dependent on the number of complement at-risk alleles .,4
"Future trials should consider the use of a composite clinical trial endpoint in which efficacy is defined by the treatments ability to prevent drusen growth , neovascularization , and the formation of geographic atrophy over 1 year .",4
"After a median of 8.0 months ( interquartile range , 4.0-23 .3 months ) of follow-up , 149 patients ( 58 % ) had maintained sinus rhythm and 107 patients ( 42 % ) had recurrence of AF .",3
"In our study cohort ( mean age 5911years ; mean left ventricular ejection fraction , 5810 % ) , impaired total LA ( LAtotal ) was associated with greater left ventricular mass index ( r = -0.245 , P < .001 ) and worsening left ventricular diastolic function ( ratio of transmitral flow peak early diastolic velocity to peak early diastolic velocity of the mitral annulus : r = -0.357 , P < .001 ; maximal LA volume index : r = -0.393 , P < .001 ) .",3
Patients with LAtotal < 23.2 % showed a higher incidence of AF recurrence compared with patients with LAtotal 23.2 % ( log-rank P < .001 ) .,3
"In multivariate Cox proportional-hazards analysis , LAtotal was independently related to rhythm outcomes ( hazard ratio , 0.944 ; 95 % confidence interval , 0.915-0 .975 ; P < .001 ) after AF ablation .",3
"Moreover , LAtotal provided incremental predictive value for rhythm outcomes over clinical features ( increment in global ( 2 ) = 14.63 , P < .001 ) .",3
"In patients with AF , baseline LAtotal was associated with rhythm outcome after catheter ablation .",4
"More than 47,000 children were enrolled .",3
"In 30,527 infants younger than 7 months at enrollment , 98,436 outpatient antimicrobial purchases were reported with incidence of 1.69 per person-year in the control clusters .",3
"Analysis of the main objective included 91 % of all antimicrobial purchases : 31,982 in the control and 57,964 in the PHiD-CV10 clusters .",3
Vaccine effectiveness was 8 % ( 95 % CI 1-14 ) and the incidence rate difference 0.12 per person-year corresponding to the number needed to vaccinate of five ( 95 % CI 3-67 ) to prevent one purchase during the 2 year follow-up for combined PHiD-CV10 three plus one and two plus one infant schedules .,3
The vaccine effectiveness was identical for the two infant schedules .,3
"In the catch-up schedules , the vaccine effectiveness was 3 % ( 95 % CI -4 to 10 ) .",3
Despite low relative rate reductions the absolute rate reductions were substantial because of the high incidence of the outcome .,4
"This reduction would lead to over 12,000 fewer antimicrobial purchases per year in children younger than 24 months in Finland ( birth cohort of 60,000 children ) .",4
"The scores on NIH-CPSI , IIEF-5 , HADA and HADD obtained at 4 and 8 weeks after treatment showed statistically significant differences between the two time points as well as from the baseline ( P < 0.01 ) .",3
"At 8 weeks , the scores on NIH-CPSI , IIEF-5 , HADA and HADD were 6.83 + / - 4.96 , 21.03 + / - 2.54 , 6.05 + / - 1.62 , and 5.35 + / - 3.30 in the experimental group , as compared with 7.55 + / - 4.89 , 17.68 + / - 4.15 , 6.88 + / - 2.45 , and 7.85 + / - 3.77 in the control ( P < 0.05 ) .",3
"The rate of effectiveness was significantly higher in the experimental than in the control group ( 90 % [ 36/40 ] vs 70 % [ 28/40 ] , P < 0.05 ) .",3
"Shuganyiyang Capsule combined with conventional Western medicine , such as alpha blockers and galenica , produces definite effect on chronic prostatitis complicated by ED , improves the psychological conditions of the patient , and enhances the therapeutic efficiency of chronic prostatits .",4
"All students demonstrated improvement in episode management , risk reduction/prevention , and health promotion behaviors ; Staying Healthy-Asthma Responsible & Prepared students demonstrated increased improvement in episode management and risk reduction/prevention behaviors .",3
"Working with schoolteachers , nurses can improve the use of effective asthma self-care behaviors .",4
"We randomly assigned 92 patients to the azithromycin group ( n = 47 ) or the placebo group ( n = 45 ) , of whom 41 ( 87 % ) versus 36 ( 80 % ) completed the study .",3
We recorded 84 exacerbations in patients in the azithromycin group compared with 129 in those in the placebo group .,3
The unadjusted exacerbation rate per patient per year was 194 ( 95 % CI 150-252 ) for the azithromycin group and 322 ( 262-397 ) for the placebo group .,3
"After adjustment , azithromycin resulted in a significant reduction in the exacerbation rate versus placebo ( 058 , 95 % CI 042-079 ; p = 0001 ) .",3
Three ( 6 % ) patients in the azithromycin group reported serious adverse events compared with five ( 11 % ) in the placebo group .,3
"During follow-up , the most common adverse event was diarrhoea in the azithromycin group ( nine [ 19 % ] patients vs one [ 2 % ] in the placebo group ; p = 0015 ) .",3
Maintenance treatment with azithromycin significantly decreased the exacerbation rate compared with placebo and should therefore be considered for use in patients with COPD who have the frequent exacerbator phenotype and are refractory to standard care .,4
The demographic data were not significantly different between these two groups ( P > 0.05 ) .,3
The ALT was not significantly changed after the surgery in the C group ( P > 0.05 ) but was significantly decreased 48 hours ( P = 0.002 ) and 72 hours ( P = 0.001 ) after the surgery in the U group .,3
"TBil and DBil were significantly increased 48 hours ( P = 0.012 , P = 0.000 ) and 72 hours ( P = 0.000 , P = 0.000 ) after the surgery in C group , while only that at 48 hours ( P = 0.010 , P = 0.038 ) was significantly increased in the U group .",3
"ALT 4 hours ( P = 0.026 ) , 48 hours ( P = 0.013 ) , 72 hours ( P = 0.004 ) after the surgery were significantly lower in the U group than those in C group .",3
TBil at the 72 hours postoperatively in U group was significantly lower than that in C group ( P = 0.036 ) .,3
DBil was not significantly different between C group and U group at all time points ( all P > 0.05 ) .,3
The application of ulinastatin in bilateral TKA can protect postoperative liver function .,4
"As compared to the control group , the intervention group reported higher prevalence of consistent condom use with the sole male sex partner in the last month at month 2 ( 75.3 versus 59.8 % , RR = 1.26 , 95 % CI = 1.01 , 1.57 ) and month 3 ( 77.8 versus 54.6 % , RR = 1.42 , 95 % CI = 1.13 , 1.80 ) , whilst the baseline between-group difference was statistically non-significant .",3
Some other secondary outcomes such as `` intention to request condom use in the next month even if the sexual partner dislikes using condoms '' were also statistically significant .,3
"Furthermore , the majority ( 94 % ) of the intervention group members were satisfied with the intervention .",3
"The theory-based intervention is potentially efficacious , but the follow-up period was relatively short .",4
Large-scale randomized clinical trials and subsequent translational research are greatly warranted in the future .,4
"Caffeine increased exercise capacity by 7.93 s ( +3.0 % ; P = 0.010 ) ; however , postexercise fatigue and perception of exertion were comparable with the placebo session ( P = 0.632 and P = 0.902 , respectively ) .",3
Increases in isometric grip strength trended toward significance in both dominant ( +2.9 % ; P = 0.053 ) and nondominant ( +2.1 % ; P = 0.061 ) hands in the caffeine trial compared with placebo .,3
"Caffeine ingestion did not result in improvements in performance for any of the remaining functional measures , including the timed up-and-go test , repeated chair stands , 6-m fast walk , and 6-m backward tandem walk .",3
"Systolic blood pressure and HR were significantly increased ( P = 0.006 and P = 0.040 , respectively ) upon completion of the testing battery when compared with placebo .",3
Consumption of caffeine 1 h before exercise induced improvements in exercise capacity and muscular strength in prostate cancer survivors .,4
"However , there was no change in exercise-related fatigue when compared with placebo despite reduction in timed performance of the 400-m walk .",4
Caffeine seems to enhance exercise tolerance through improved performance with no subsequent increase in fatigue or perception of exertion and may be an appropriate strategy to promote exercise participation in prostate cancer survivors .,4
"Of 6,504 individuals that met study criteria , 1,188 started on cholinesterase inhibitors were matched to 2,189 started on other medications .",3
The propensity-matched cohorts were well balanced on baseline covariates .,3
"Participants initiated on cholinesterase inhibitors had a higher risk of weight loss than matched controls at 12 months ( hazard ratio = 1.23 , 95 % confidence interval ( CI ) = 1.07-1 .41 ) .",3
"At 12 months , 29.3 % of participants taking cholinesterase inhibitors had experienced weight loss , compared with 22.8 % of nonusers , corresponding to a number needed to harm of 21.2 ( 95 % CI = 12.5-71 .4 ) over 1 year .",3
There were no significant differences in the risk of weight loss within subgroups .,3
These results are consistent with the available data from randomized controlled trials .,4
Clinicians should consider the risk of weight loss when prescribing cholinesterase inhibitors .,4
The trial was terminated following a recommendation from the Safety Monitoring Board due to hepatotoxicity concerns .,3
"At termination , the planned 660 patients had been randomized , 656 had been treated with 1 dose of study medication , and 14 had completed the trial .",3
The mean treatment duration was 48-50 days .,3
"Thirteen patients , all in the telcagepant groups , had an alanine aminotransferase ( ALT ) elevation 3 the upper limit of normal and 7 of these also had an aspartate aminotransferase elevation 3 the upper limit of normal .",3
Two patients had very high symptomatic transaminase elevations that occurred within 2-6 weeks of treatment initiation and resolved after treatment discontinuation .,3
"The originally planned efficacy analysis over 12 weeks was not performed due to limited data at later time points , but there was evidence that telcagepant resulted in a larger reduction from baseline than placebo for mean monthly headache days ( month 1 : 140 mg = -2.9 , 280 mg = -3.1 , placebo = -1.7 ; p < 0.05 ) and migraine/probable migraine days ( month 1 : 140 mg = -2.7 , 280 mg = -3.0 , placebo = -1.6 ; p < 0.05 ) .",3
These data suggest a potential role for CGRP receptor antagonism in migraine prophylaxis .,4
"However , the observed aminotransferase elevations do not support the use of telcagepant for daily administration .",4
"Overall , 362 questionnaires were collected ( 26 online , 2 by phone ) and 58 physicians were ineligible .",3
The completion rate increased from 26.7 % in physicians who received no intervention to 42.7 % in those who received the book and a phone call .,3
"The phone call increased the completion rate by 11 % percentage points ( P = 0.01 ) , while the book had no significant effect .",3
Results from multivariate logistic regressions also indicate that gynecologists ( OR = 1.6 ) and female physicians ( OR = 1.5 ) were more likely to participate than others .,3
The results suggest that phone calls substantially increase participation of physicians in sexual and reproductive health surveys but have little impact on sampling distortion .,4
Differentials in response rates by physicians ' characteristics should be considered in future SRH studies among physicians .,4
"Between June 16 , 2004 , and March 24 , 2009 , we screened 86 patients and enrolled 84 ; 42 were randomly assigned to each group .",3
"The cumulative incidence of grade 2-4 acute graft-versus-host disease was 46 % ( 95 % CI 32-62 ) in the rituximab group and 42 % ( 95 % CI 29-59 ) in the no rituximab group ( hazard ratio [ HR ] 091 , 95 % CI 052-160 ; p = 074 ) .",3
Overall survival at 1 year for the whole study population was 52 % ( 95 % CI 41-62 ) .,3
Grade 4 haematological toxic effects and grade 3 alopecia occurred in all patients .,3
The most common non-haematological grade 5 toxic effects were pneumonia ( nine in the no rituximab group vs ten in the rituximab group ) and other infections ( seven vs four ) .,3
The lymphoma-directed myeloablative conditioning regimen developed here is promising for patients with refractory and relapsed aggressive B-cell and T-cell lymphomas .,4
"However , the addition of rituximab did not affect the incidence of graft-versus-host disease or overall survival .",4
The CDAs have positive effects on social-emotional development for children at approximately age 4 years .,3
"The nonweighted treatment-control difference is -1.56 ( 90 % CI , -2.87 to -0.22 ; P = .06 ) , but the weighted difference is nonsignificant .",3
"The effects appear to be greater for disadvantaged subsamples , such as low-income households ( weighted mean difference,-2 .21 ; 90 % CI , -4.01 to -0.42 ; P = .04 ) .",3
"As a complement to other early education and health interventions , CDAs may improve social-emotional development in early childhood .",4
Their effects may be explained as a mediating process that influences parents .,4
"Child Development Accounts may influence parental attitudes , behaviors , expectations , and involvement ; in turn , these may affect child development .",4
Anakinra pretreatment significantly diminished airway neutrophilia compared with placebo .,3
"LPS-induced IL-1 , IL-6 , and IL-8 levels were significantly reduced during the anakinra treatment period compared with those seen after placebo .",3
Subjects tolerated the anakinra treatment well without an increased frequency of infections attributable to anakinra treatment .,3
Anakinra effectively reduced airway neutrophilic inflammation and resulted in no serious adverse events in a model of inhaled LPS challenge .,4
Anakinra is a potential therapeutic candidate for treatment of asthma with neutrophil predominance in diseased populations .,4
"The coronal free-breathing GOLD sequence and the axial breath-hold standard gradient echo sequence showed good agreement of the gastric half emptying time ( 6 3 min , P = 0.053 ) .",3
"The GOLD sequence demonstrated sensitivity to reduction of gastric secretion volumes induced by PPI treatment ( 55 5 mL , P < 0.001 ) .",3
"The GOLD sequence allowed for free breathing , multislice , combined imaging and T1 mapping of the stomach content .",4
"GOLD presents a promising multipurpose , noninvasive imaging tool for monitoring gastric function in clinical studies .",4
Both groups were similar at baseline .,3
The homocysteine decreased in both groups but statistically non-significant ( P > 0.05 ) .,3
"The changes of the serum level of vitamin B12 , osteocalcin , and cross laps were significant between groups after 6months ( P0 .05 ) .",3
The trend of changes of bone biomarkers after 6months folic acid supplementation shows that homocysteine concentration and/or folic acid supplementation have impact on the rate of bone metabolism .,4
"However , further investigations by larger sample size and differentiating age and gender are still needed to clarify the exact role of folate , homocysteine and vitamin B12 .",4
"Overall , there was no significant difference in the degree of clinical improvement between active and sham cTBS groups .",3
"However , in patients whose medication status remained unchanged before the trial ( n = 8 ) and in those who were medication-free ( n = 3 ) , active cTBS resulted in a significantly greater reduction of Hamilton depression scores as compared to sham cTBS .",3
"A small sample size , confounding effect of medication and short treatment period .",4
"Our results suggest that the antidepressant effect of cTBS is modest , yet it might be beneficial to patients nonresponsive to ongoing pharmacological treatment .",4
A direct comparison between cTBS and conventional rTMS protocols is warranted .,4
"The intraoperative AECP , postoperative corneal incision edema , and postoperative visual recovery showed no significant differences between the groups ( p > 0.05 ) .",3
"At 1 month postoperatively , the corneal endothelial cell loss rate and hexagonal cell percentage ( postoperative compared to preoperative ) in groups A and B were 0.117 0.12 and 9.97 9.52 % and 0.15 0.73 and 8.5 4.60 % , respectively , with no significant difference noted ( p > 0.05 ) .",3
"The endothelial cell mutation rate was significantly lower in group A than in group B at 6.41 6.78 % and 28.27 27.95 % , respectively ( p < 0.05 ) .",3
"The frequency of intraoperative shallow anterior chamber was significantly lower in group A than in group B ( 2 vs 17 times , p < 0.05 ) .",3
"Continuous ultrasonic phacoemulsification with ACM is a safe , effective , simple , and easy method to treat hard nuclear cataract and causes minimal damage to corneal endothelial cells .",4
It is an ideal surgical option and is worth popularizing .,4
"We evaluated 47 ( 96 % ) of 49 residents , all 971 admissions , 5894 patient-days and 452 staff surveys .",3
"We found no effect of schedule ( 24 - , 16 - or 12-h shifts ) on adverse events ( 81.3 , 76.3 and 78.2 events per 1000 patient-days , respectively ; p = 0.7 ) or on residents ' sleepiness in the daytime ( mean rating 2.33 , 2.61 and 2.30 , respectively ; p = 0.3 ) or at night ( mean rating 3.06 , 2.73 and 2.42 , respectively ; p = 0.2 ) .",3
Seven of 8 preventable adverse events occurred with the 12-hour schedule ( p = 0.1 ) .,3
Mortality rates were similar for the 3 schedules .,3
"Residents ' somatic symptoms were more severe and more frequent with the 24-hour schedule ( p = 0.04 ) ; however , burnout was similar across the groups .",3
ICU staff rated residents ' knowledge and decision-making worst with the 16-hour schedule .,3
Our findings do not support the purported advantages of shorter duty schedules .,4
They also highlight the trade-offs between residents ' symptoms and multiple secondary measures of patient safety .,4
Further delineation of this emerging signal is required before widespread system change .,4
"The primary end point of postpericardiotomy syndrome occurred in 35 patients ( 19.4 % ) assigned to colchicine and in 53 ( 29.4 % ) assigned to placebo ( absolute difference , 10.0 % ; 95 % CI , 1.1 % -18.7 % ; number needed to treat = 10 ) .",3
"There were no significant differences between the colchicine and placebo groups for the secondary end points of postoperative AF ( colchicine , 61 patients [ 33.9 % ] ; placebo , 75 patients [ 41.7 % ] ; absolute difference , 7.8 % ; 95 % CI , -2.2 % to 17.6 % ) or postoperative pericardial/pleural effusion ( colchicine , 103 patients [ 57.2 % ] ; placebo , 106 patients [ 58.9 % ] ; absolute difference , 1.7 % ; 95 % CI , -8.5 % to 11.7 % ) , although there was a reduction in postoperative AF in the prespecified on-treatment analysis ( placebo , 61/148 patients [ 41.2 % ] ; colchicine , 38/141 patients [ 27.0 % ] ; absolute difference , 14.2 % ; 95 % CI , 3.3 % -24.7 % ) .",3
"Adverse events occurred in 21 patients ( 11.7 % ) in the placebo group vs 36 ( 20.0 % ) in the colchicine group ( absolute difference , 8.3 % ; 95 % CI ; 0.76 % -15.9 % ; number needed to harm = 12 ) , but discontinuation rates were similar .",3
No serious adverse events were observed .,3
"Among patients undergoing cardiac surgery , perioperative use of colchicine compared with placebo reduced the incidence of postpericardiotomy syndrome but not of postoperative AF or postoperative pericardial/pleural effusion .",4
The increased risk of gastrointestinal adverse effects reduced the potential benefits of colchicine in this setting .,4
"Among 786 participants , average atazanavir clearance was slower in females ( n = 131 ) than males ( n = 655 ) .",3
Atazanavir clearance was associated with time to virological failure ( P = 0.053 ) and this relationship differed significantly by sex ( P = 0.003 ) .,3
Females in the fast atazanavir clearance group had shorter time to virological failure ( HR 3.49 ; 95 % CI 1.24-9 .84 ) compared with the middle ( reference ) atazanavir clearance group .,3
"Among males , the slow atazanavir clearance group had a higher risk of virological failure ( HR 2.10 ; 95 % CI 1.16-3 .77 ) .",3
Atazanavir clearance differed by sex .,4
Females with fast clearance and males with slow clearance had increased risk of virological failure .,4
"Patients from the control ( no CPAP ) group had significantly increased concentrations of interleukin ( IL ) -1 , IL-1 , IL-10 , tumour necrosis factor-alpha , macrophage inflammatory protein ( MIP ) -1 , pulmonary and activation-regulated chemokine ( PARC ) , and IL-8 in the collapsed ( right ) lung when compared with patients from the CPAP group ( P < 0.05 ) .",3
The ventilated ( left ) lung of the control group showed increased concentrations of monocyte chemoattractant protein ( MCP ) -1 and MIP-1 ( P < 0.05 ) .,3
"Serum concentrations of cytokines and chemokines increased during surgery , but did not differ between the control and CPAP groups .",3
A significantly lower local immune response was observed during one-lung ventilation when CPAP was applied to the collapsed lung .,4
The findings suggest a beneficial effect of CPAP on the collapsed lung during oesophagectomy with one-lung ventilation .,4
"Depression-anxiety factor was the most powerful predictor of LoM at both time points , followed by sexual problems of ADT side effects ( breast changes and hot flushes ) .",3
Urinary dysfunction was not a consistent predictor of LoM .,3
Depression-anxiety was also the most significant factor distinguishing between those men who reported LoM and those who did not .,3
"Although LoM is often reported as arising from ADT , the relative power of depression-anxiety in predicting LoM , both at the selected time points and using a time-lagged analysis , plus the finding that depression-anxiety was the most consistent difference between men who reported LoM and those who did not , argues for the presence of adverse mood states as being the key ingredient in deciding if PCa patients experience loss of their feelings of masculinity .",4
Surgical tissue samples were available from 33 patients deemed inoperable .,3
IGF1R status varied according to histopathology .,3
"Patients with tumors positive for IGF1R mRNA expression had a shorter progression-free and overall survival when compared to the negative sub-group ( 6.1 vs. 7.4 months , p = 0.039 and 10.9 vs. 14.3 months , p = 0.038 , respectively ) .",3
"IGF1R protein expression showed a similar , although non-significant tendency .",3
IGF1R mRNA expression may be a prognostic biomarker in advanced NSCLC and should be investigated in a larger population .,4
There were 26 ( 43.3 % ) patients in the subparaneural group and 22 ( 36.7 % ) in the extraneural group .,3
"Block onset time was shorter in the subparaneural group than in the extraneural group ( 11 [ 3-21 ] minutes ; mean [ 95 % confidence interval ] , 11 [ 8.97-13 .02 ] minutes and 17 [ 6-30 ] minutes ; mean [ 95 % confidence interval ] 18.37 [ 14.17-22 .57 ] minutes , respectively ; P = 0.002 ) .",3
The duration of sensory blockade increased ( 397 [ 178-505 ] minutes vs 265 [ 113-525 ] minutes ; P = 0.04 ) .,3
The success rate of the block also increased .,3
Unintentional intraepineural injection occurred in 8 % of patients ( 3 patients in the subparaneural group and 1 patient in the extraneural group ; NS ) .,3
"Block onset time was shorter than for the subparaneural and extraneural groups ( 6 [ 3-12 ] minutes , 12 [ 3-21 ] minutes , and 18 [ 6-30 ] minutes ; P = 0.01 ) .",3
A subparaneural injection accelerated the onset time and increased the duration of tibial nerve sensory blockade compared with circumferential extraneural injection .,4
"With unintentional intraepineural spread , the onset time was significantly shorter than for the other groups .",4
"A total of 128 recipients were enrolled in this study ; 59 of them were randomized to the long-term arm and 62 were randomized to the short-term arm , forming the modified intent-to-treat ( mITT ) set .",3
"The incidence of IFD within day +90 , the primary endpoint , was not significantly different between the 2 arms for the mITT set ( 6.78 % in the long-term arm vs. 6.45 % in the short-term arm , P = 0.94 ) , or for the per-protocol set ( 6.90 % in the long-term arm vs. 6.67 % in the short-term arm , P = 0.96 ) .",3
"From day +30 to day +90 , the incidence of IFD was 0 % and 6.45 % , respectively , in the patients with long-term and short-term prophylaxis for the mITT set ( P = 0.11 ) .",3
The mean trough serum concentrations of ITCZ was maintained at > 500 ng/mL throughout administration .,3
"The incidences of withdrawal because of drug-related adverse events in patients with long-term and short-term prophylaxis were 6.78 % and 0 % , respectively ( P = 0.05 ) .",3
Long-term and short-term administration of ITCZ both seemed effective in preventing IFD in recipients of allo-HSCT .,4
Further study with large sample size should be performed to evaluate this result .,4
ITCZ shows the same pharmacokinetics in recipients of allo-HSCT as in non-recipients .,4
"In all , 107 patients were accrued : gemcitabine-docetaxel plus placebo ( n = 54 ) and gemcitabine-docetaxel plus bevacizumab ( n = 53 ) .",3
Accrual was stopped early for futility .,3
No statistically significant differences in grade 3 to 4 toxicities were observed .,3
"Median PFS was 6.2 months for gemcitabine-docetaxel plus placebo versus 4.2 months for gemcitabine-docetaxel plus bevacizumab ( HR , 1.12 ; P = .58 ) .",3
"Median OS was 26.9 months for gemcitabine-docetaxel plus placebo and 23.3 months for gemcitabine-docetaxel plus bevacizumab ( HR , 1.07 ; P = .81 ) .",3
Objective responses were observed in 17 ( 31.5 % ) of 54 patients randomly assigned to gemcitabine-docetaxel plus placebo and 19 ( 35.8 % ) of 53 patients randomly assigned to gemcitabine-docetaxel plus bevacizumab .,3
Mean duration of response was 8.6 months for gemcitabine-docetaxel plus placebo versus 8.8 months for gemcitabine-docetaxel plus bevacizumab .,3
"The addition of bevacizumab to gemcitabine-docetaxel for first-line treatment of metastatic uLMS failed to improve PFS , OS , or ORR .",4
Gemcitabine-docetaxel remains a standard first-line treatment for uLMS .,4
A total of 26 gastrointestinal cancer patients could be randomized .,3
Twenty-one patients completed the 12 weeks of intervention .,3
"The median adherence rate to exercise training of all 26 patients was 65 % , while in patients who were able to complete 12 weeks , adherence was 75 % .",3
The fatigue score of all patients decreased from 66 to 43 post-intervention .,3
Sleeping duration increased in both groups and muscular strength increased in the RET group .,3
A higher number of steps in daily living was associated with higher levels of physical and social functioning as well as lower scores for pain and fatigue .,3
RET and AET are feasible in gastrointestinal cancer patients undergoing palliative chemotherapy .,4
Both training programs seem to improve cancer-related symptoms as well as the patient 's physical activities of daily living .,4
"QCG compared to a control was more effective in controlling hemorrhage , withstanding increases in systolic blood pressure , more latitude in resuscitation fluid , and movement ( p < 0.05 ) .",3
Data of 53 subjects - 26 on silodosin and 27 on tamsulosin were analyzed .,3
Final IPSS at 12-week was significantly less than baseline for both groups .,3
"However , groups remained comparable in terms of IPSS at all visits .",3
There was a significant impact on sexual function ( assessed by IPSS sexual function score ) in silodosin arm compared with tamsulosin .,3
Prostate size and uroflowmetry parameters did not change .,3
Both treatments were well-tolerated .,3
Retrograde ejaculation was encountered only with silodosin and postural hypotension only with tamsulosin .,3
Silodosin is comparable to tamsulosin in the treatment of BPH in Indian men .,4
"However , retrograde ejaculation may be troublesome for sexually active patients .",4
"Comparing macrolides group and cephalosporins group , there is not statistically significant ( P > 0.05 ) .",3
"Treatment with macrolides cefixime tablet ineffective treatment of patients for 3 months , compared before and after treatment was statistically significant ( P < 0.01 ) .",3
"Treatment with cefixime tablet macrolides ineffective treatment of patients for 3 months , compared before and after treatment was not statistically significant ( P > 0.05 ) .",3
"Long-term low-dose applications of macrolides have a good effect in patients with chronic rhinosinusit , particularly for refractory chronic rhinosinusit have a significant effect .",4
"A total of 120 subjects were randomized , 60 each to sublingual asenapine or placebo .",3
"Mean ( SE ) baseline PANSS-EC scores for the asenapine-treated and placebo-treated subjects were 19.4 0.66 and 20.1 0.61 , respectively .",3
Mean PANSS-EC scores at endpoint ( LOCF ) was 7.4 0.65 for the asenapine-treated subjects and 14.7 0.98 for the placebo-treated subjects .,3
Change in PANSS-EC score at 2 h was statistically significantly greater for the asenapine-treated subjects compared with the placebo-treated subjects .,3
NNT for response vs. placebo was 3 ( 95 % CI 2-4 ) .,3
Sublingual asenapine was efficacious in the treatment of agitation with an effect size comparable to that observed in prior studies of intramuscular antipsychotics .,4
"After six months , compared to the control group , the intervention group showed a significant improvement on fatigue ( = -3.76 , P < 0.001 ) , sleep quality ( = -0.59 , P = 0.007 ) , strenuous physical activity ( = 0.17 , P = 0.028 ) , and snacking behavior ( = -0.81 , P < 0.001 ) .",3
No significant effects were found for other outcome measures .,3
The MORE Energy mHealth intervention reduced self-reported fatigue compared to a minimal intervention .,4
"Some aspects of health-related behavior ( physical activity and snacking behavior ) and sleep ( sleep quality ) improved as well , but most did not .",4
The results show offering tailored advice through an mHealth intervention is an effective means to support employees who have to cope with irregular flight schedules and circadian disruption .,4
This kind of intervention might therefore also be beneficial for other working populations with irregular working hours .,4
"Intrahepatic recurrence rate of HAIC group and the control group was respectively 19.05 % and 39.53 % , P < 0.05 .",3
"Disease-free survival rate was respectively 57.14 % and 44.19 % , P < 0.05 .",3
"Overall survival rate was 66.67 % and 46.51 % , P < 0.05 .",3
All patients in HAIC group tolerated the therapy .,3
No adverse effect above grade 3 was reported in HAIC group .,3
HAIC effectively and safely prevents intrahepatic recurrence and improves the prognosis of patients with HCC after curative resection .,4
"A total of 130 subjects were recruited but 14 with subsyndromal delirium were excluded , leaving 116 subjects ( mean age 83.6 years ) .",3
Forty-eight percent had prior dementia .,3
"RC from pre-delirium to admission was 42 % for the Mini-Mental State Examination , 41 % for Selective IADL , 34 % for 5-DSF , 54 % for 6-DSF , and 37 % for the Apathy Evaluation Scale .",3
"Improvements after admission ( RC and RC/MPC ratios ) were 32 % / 98 % for 5-DSF , 54 % / 82 % for 6-DSF , and 45 % / 80 % for the Delirium Index .",3
General medicine and geriatric medicine groups had similar outcomes .,3
"This delirium phenotype selects for a rapid high amplitude critical decline in attention , executive function , IADL , and apathy that recovers almost as rapidly .",4
A total of 87 patients were enrolled .,3
There was no difference in demographic data between the groups .,3
No pulmonary emboli were identified .,3
"The control group had a DVT rate of 16 % , while the experimental group had a rate of 14 % ( p = nonsignificant ) .",3
"The experimental group 's median enoxaparin dosage , 50 mg twice a day , was significantly higher than that of the control ( p < 0.01 ) .",3
TEG R was not different between the control and experimental groups .,3
"Beginning at Day 3 , anti-Xa levels were higher in the experimental group ( p < 0.05 ) .",3
There was no difference in AT-III activity between the two groups ; 67 % of the patients demonstrated AT-III deficiency .,3
"TEG adjusted enoxaparin dosing led to significant increases in anti-Xa activity , which did not correlate with a decreased DVT rate .",4
Failure to reduce the DVT rate and increase R despite increased dosing and increased anti-Xa activity is consistent with the high rate of AT-III deficiency detected in this study cohort .,4
These data suggest that the future of DVT prevention may not lie in the optimization of low molecular weight heparin therapy but rather in compounds that increase antithrombin directly or operate independently of the AT-III pathway .,4
"Seven months after intervention , the mean ( SD ) of the sexual distress score decreased and sexual composite score increased significantly in both groups ( P < 0.001 ) .",3
The overall analysis of repeated measure manova revealed borderline significance differences for combined outcomes between two groups ( P = 0.051 ) .,3
"Due to the considerable human resource , time , and cost spent conducting the PLISSIT , it seems that group education based on SHM could be more cost-efficient and nearly as effective .",4
This conclusion may be more applicable in communities where the treatment of sexual problems is in the beginning stages and where people have not received any sexual education or knowledge during their lifetime .,4
A total of 219 patients entered the LTE ; 114 ( 52.1 % ) completed 7 years of treatment with abatacept plus MTX .,3
"Cumulative ( DB + LTE ) incidence rates of serious adverse events , serious infections , malignancies , and autoimmune events were 17.6 , 3.2 , 1.8 , and 1.2 / 100 patient-years , respectively .",3
Safety was consistent between the DB ( n = 220 ) and cumulative ( n = 287 ) periods .,3
"Improvements in American College of Rheumatology responses , disease activity , and normalisation of physical function and health-related quality of life were maintained over time .",3
"Approximately 80 % of patients who achieved low disease activity or normalised modified Health Assessment Questionnaire scores at Year 1 , and who remained in the study , sustained these responses in each subsequent year .",3
IV abatacept in combination with MTX demonstrated consistent safety and sustained efficacy over 7 years in MTX inadequate responders with established RA .,4
"Furthermore , some patients demonstrated a normalisation of physical function and health-related quality of life that was sustained over time .",4
"There were U-shaped associations of vitamin D with total cancer risk : compared with the first quintile , HRs were 0.83 [ 95 % confidence interval ( CI ) , 0.66-1 .03 ; P = 0.092 ] , 0.74 ( 95 % CI , 0.59-0 .92 ; P = 0.008 ) , 0.86 ( 95 % CI , 0.69-1 .07 ; P = 0.181 ) , and 0.98 ( 95 % CI , 0.78-1 .21 ; P = 0.823 ) , for the second through fifth quintiles , respectively .",3
"For Gleason 7-10 cancer , corresponding HRs were 0.63 ( 95 % CI , 0.45-0 .90 ; P = 0.010 ) , 0.66 ( 95 % CI , 0.47-0 .92 ; P = 0.016 ) , 0.79 ( 95 % CI , 0.56-1 .10 ; P = 0.165 ) , and 0.88 ( 95 % CI , 0.63-1 .22 ; P = 0.436 ) .",3
"Among African American men ( n = 250 cases ) , higher vitamin D was associated with reduced risk of Gleason 7-10 cancer only : in the a posteriori contrast of quintiles 1-2 versus 3-5 , the HR was 0.55 ( 95 % CI , 0.31-0 .97 ; P = 0.037 ) , with no evidence of dose-response or a U-shaped association .",3
"Both low and high vitamin D concentrations were associated with increased risk of prostate cancer , and more strongly for high-grade disease .",4
The optimal range of circulating vitamin D for prostate cancer prevention may be narrow .,4
Supplementation of men with adequate levels may be harmful .,4

"CCQ total scores deteriorated in both groups , with no significant difference between them .",3
"CCQ symptom domain did show a significant and clinically relevant difference in favor of the on-demand-group , -0.4 0.21 , CI95 % -0.87 ; -0.02 , p = 0.04 .",3
Similar tendency was found for the SGRQ whereas results for SF-36 were inconsistent .,3
"Patients in the on-demand-group visited GP significantly less ( p = 0.01 ) , but PNP significantly more , p = 0.003 .",3
Visits to pulmonologists and exacerbations were equally frequent in both groups .,3
"Mean total costs per patient were lower in the on-demand-group in comparison with usual care , difference of -518 ( -1993 ; 788 ) from healthcare provider and -458 ( -2700 ; 1652 ) insurance perspective .",3
"The on-demand-system was comparable with usual care , had a cost-saving tendency , and can be instituted with confidence in the COPD outpatient care setting .",4
Lullaby reduced heart rate ( p < 0.001 ) and respiratory rate ( p = 0.004 ) .,3
"These effects extended in the period after the exposure ( p < .001 and p = 0.001 , respectively ) .",3
Classical music reduced heart rate ( p = 0.018 ) .,3
The effects of classical music disappeared once the music stopped .,3
Oxygen saturation did not change during intervention .,3
Music can affect vital signs of preterm infants ; this effect can possibly be related to the reduction of stress during hospitalization .,4
The implications of these findings on clinical and developmental outcomes need further study .,4
Drugs ' ability of alleviate oral pain or pain on swallowing and the onset time was not significantly different between the 2 groups ( P > 0.05 ) .,3
Effective duration in experimental group was longer than that in control group ( P < 0.05 ) .,3
DICORAL can alleviate and cease pain caused by radiation-induced oral mucositis effectively .,4
Number of comorbidities ranged from 0 to 10 ( median 2 ) ; the comorbidity burden score ranged from 0 to 25 ( median 3 ) .,3
The most common conditions were arthritis ( 58 % ) and hypertension ( 55 % ) .,3
"Comorbidity was associated with shorter OS , but not with toxicity or TTR .",3
"The hazard of death increased by 18 % for each comorbidity ( hazard ratio [ HR ] = 1.18 , 95 % CI = 1.06 to 1.33 ) after adjusting for age , tumor size , treatment , node and receptor status .",3
"Comorbidity burden score was similarly associated with OS ( HR = 1.08 ; 95 % CI , 1.03 to 1.14 ) .",3
"Among older women enrolled onto a clinical trial , comorbidity was associated with shorter OS , but not toxicity or relapse .",4
"At 1 year , 13.7 % were abstinent and 26.0 % utilized adjunct treatment .",3
None of the contrasting factor levels differentially influenced abstinence or treatment utilization at 12 months .,3
"In the modified ITT sample , smokers receiving testimonials were less likely to use adjunct treatment at 6 months ( odds ratio = 0.54 , 95 % confidence interval = 0.30-0 .98 , p = .04 ) .",3
None of the design features enhanced treatment outcome .,4
"The negative effect observed for testimonials is provocative , but it should be viewed with caution .",4
This study offers a model for future research testing the `` active ingredients '' of online interventions .,4
"Following mixed effects regression models and path analyses , small-to-moderate effects were shown on letter knowledge , phoneme awareness and taught vocabulary .",3
"However , these were fragile and short lived , and there was no reliable effect on the primary outcome of word-level reading .",3
"This new intervention was theoretically motivated and based on previous successful interventions , yet failed to show reliable effects on language and literacy measures following a rigorous evaluation .",4
We suggest that the intervention may have been too short to yield improvements in oral language ; and that literacy instruction in and beyond the classroom may have weakened training effects .,4
We argue that reporting of null results makes an important contribution in terms of raising standards both of trial reporting and educational practice .,4
The median survival was 13 months for the patients in the sequential arm and 19 months for those in the concurrent treatment arm ( p = 0.0039 ) .,3
The disease-free survival ( DFS ) was 9 months in the sequential arm and 16 months in the concurrent treatment arm ( p = 0.0023 ) .,3
"The following prognostic factors significantly influenced the survival of the patients treated with combination of RT and chemotherapy : age ( p < 0.05 ) , performance status ( PS ) ( p < 0.001 ) , weight loss ( p < 0.001 ) , tumor size ( p < 0.05 ) , nodal involvement ( p < 0.05 ) .",3
"Given the higher toxicity in the second arm , this should be reserved for younger patients ( < 70 years ) , having good PS and minimal weight loss .",4
We highly recommend precise stage and prognostic factors definitions in such patients so that they receive the most beneficial treatment .,4
"Thirty-four patients in 20 mg statin group , 40 in 40 mg statin group , and 38 in 60 mg statin group completed this study .",3
"In all the 3 groups , hs-CRP level significantly increased at 12 and 24 h after PCI compared with the preoperative levels ( P < 0.05 ) .",3
"The patients in 60 mg statin group showed significantly lower levels of CKMB , cTNI , and hs-CRP at 24 h after PCI than those in 20 mg statin group ( P < 0.05 ) , and had also a significantly lower incidence of total MACE within 30 days after PCI ( 2.6 % vs 26.5 % , P = 0.003 ) resulting primarily from significantly reduced myocardial infarction associated with PCI ( 2.6 % vs 20.6 % , P = 0.016 ) .",3
The adverse drug reactions were comparable among the 3 groups ( P > 0.05 ) .,3
Intensive pretreatment with 60 mg/day atorvastatin calcium can significantly reduce myocardial infarction related to PCI with good safety in elderly patients with CHD .,4
"At the end of treatment , HbA1c was significantly decreased from baseline in the luseogliflozin 2.5 mg group ( -0.63 % ) versus the placebo group ( 0.13 % ) , with a between-group difference of -0.75 % ( p < 0.001 ) .",3
"Additionally , significant reductions in FPG , PPG , body weight , and abdominal circumference were noted with luseogliflozin compared with placebo ( all p < 0.05 ) .",3
"Luseogliflozin was well tolerated ; there was no significant difference between groups in the incidence of AEs ( luseogliflozin , 59.5 % ; placebo , 57.0 % ) .",3
No AEs led to study drug discontinuation .,3
"Most AEs were mild in severity , with no severe AE reported .",3
Limitations of this study include its short study duration and small sample size .,3
Luseogliflozin monotherapy for 24 weeks was superior to placebo in reducing HbA1c levels .,4
"It also reduced FPG , PPG , body weight , and abdominal circumference and was well tolerated in Japanese patients with T2DM .",4
Baseline HbA1c predicted incident diabetes in all treatment groups .,3
Diabetes incidence defined by HbA1c 6.5 % was reduced by 44 % by metformin and 49 % by lifestyle during the DPP and by 38 % by metformin and 29 % by lifestyle throughout follow-up .,3
"Unlike the primary DPP and DPPOS findings based on glucose criteria , metformin and lifestyle were similarly effective in preventing diabetes defined by HbA1c .",3
HbA1c predicted incident diabetes .,4
"In contrast to the superiority of the lifestyle intervention on glucose-defined diabetes , metformin and lifestyle interventions had similar effects in preventing HbA1c-defined diabetes .",4
The long-term implications for other health outcomes remain to be determined .,4
"Of the 59 patients , 29 were randomized to the rufinamide group and 30 to the placebo group .",3
"The frequency of epileptic seizures was significantly decreased in the rufinamide group than in the placebo group ; the median percent change in frequency of tonic-atonic seizures was -24.2 % and -3.3 % , respectively , ( p = 0.003 ) and that of total seizures was -32.9 % and -3.1 % , respectively ( p < 0.001 ) .",3
Subgroup analyses indicated that the efficacy of rufinamide was consistent independent of clinical background characteristics .,3
"The common treatment-related adverse events in the rufinamide group were decreased appetite ( 17.2 % ) , somnolence ( 17.2 % ) , and vomiting ( 13.8 % ) .",3
"Transient seizure aggravations were observed in 13 ( 22.0 % ) of the 59 patients , though a causal relationship with rufinamide was suspected in only one patient .",3
All adverse events were mild to moderate in severity .,3
The mean plasma concentration of rufinamide between 1 and 9 within 12h after administration was 17.2 g/mL .,3
The present results showed a favorable risk-benefit profile for rufinamide as an adjunctive therapy for patients with LGS .,4
This study is the first randomized controlled trial in the ( cost ) - effectiveness of a blended exercise intervention for patients with osteoarthritis of the hip and/or knee .,4
The findings will help to improve the treatment of patients with osteoarthritis .,4
"We studied 7166 participants in the PREvencin with DIeta MEDiterrnea trial testing a Mediterranean diet ( MedDiet ) intervention versus a control diet for cardiovascular prevention , with a median follow-up of 4.8 years .",3
"Diet , lipids , MLXIPL polymorphisms , and cardiovascular events were assessed .",3
Data were analyzed at baseline and longitudinally .,3
We used multivariable-adjusted Cox regression to estimate hazard ratios for cardiovascular outcomes .,3
"The MLXIPL-rs3812316 was associated with lower baseline triglycerides ( P = 5.510 ( -5 ) ) and lower hypertriglyceridemia ( odds ratio , 0.73 ; 95 % confidence interval [ CI ] , 0.63-0 .85 ; P = 1.410 ( -6 ) in G-carriers versus CC ) .",3
This association was modulated by baseline adherence to MedDiet .,3
"When adherence to MedDiet was high , the protection was stronger ( odds ratio , 0.63 ; 95 % CI , 0.51-0 .77 ; P = 8.610 ( -6 ) ) than when adherence to MedDiet was low ( odds ratio , 0.88 ; 95 % CI , 0.70-1 .09 ; P = 0.219 ) .",3
"Throughout the follow-up , both the MLXIPL-rs3812316 ( P = 3.810 ( -6 ) ) and the MedDiet intervention ( P = 0.030 ) were significantly associated with decreased triglycerides .",3
Likewise in G-carriers MedDiet intervention was associated with greater total cardiovascular risk reduction and specifically for myocardial infarction .,3
"In the MedDiet , but not in the control group , we observed lower myocardial infarction incidence in G-carriers versus CC ( hazard ratios , 0.34 ; 95 % CI , 0.12-0 .93 ; P = 0.036 and 0.90 ; 95 % CI , 0.35-2 .33 ; P = 0.830 , respectively ) .",3
Our novel results suggest that MedDiet enhances the triglyceride-lowering effect of the MLXIPL-rs3812316 variant and strengthens its protective effect on myocardial infarction incidence .,4
"Recurrent urinary tract infection developed in 39 of 302 children who received prophylaxis as compared with 72 of 305 children who received placebo ( relative risk , 0.55 ; 95 % confidence interval [ CI ] , 0.38 to 0.78 ) .",3
"Prophylaxis reduced the risk of recurrences by 50 % ( hazard ratio , 0.50 ; 95 % CI , 0.34 to 0.74 ) and was particularly effective in children whose index infection was febrile ( hazard ratio , 0.41 ; 95 % CI , 0.26 to 0.64 ) and in those with baseline bladder and bowel dysfunction ( hazard ratio , 0.21 ; 95 % CI , 0.08 to 0.58 ) .",3
"The occurrence of renal scarring did not differ significantly between the prophylaxis and placebo groups ( 11.9 % and 10.2 % , respectively ) .",3
"Among 87 children with a first recurrence caused by Escherichia coli , the proportion of isolates that were resistant to trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole was 63 % in the prophylaxis group and 19 % in the placebo group .",3
"Among children with vesicoureteral reflux after urinary tract infection , antimicrobial prophylaxis was associated with a substantially reduced risk of recurrence but not of renal scarring .",4

The effect of venlafaxine XR on neuropathic pain was similar to that of placebo .,3
"However venlafaxine XR resulted in statistically significant and clinically meaningful reductions in nociceptive pain site intensity and interference even after controlling for anxiety , depression , and multiple pain sites within the same individual .",3
"For those who achieved a minimally effective dose of venlafaxine XR , some additional evidence of effectiveness was noted for those with mixed ( both neuropathic and nociceptive ) pain sites .",3
Venlafaxine XR could complement current medications and procedures for treating pain after SCI and MDD that has nociceptive features .,4
Its usefulness for treating central neuropathic pain is likely to be limited .,4
Research is needed to replicate these findings and determine whether the antinociceptive effect of venlafaxine XR generalizes to persons with SCI pain without MDD .,4
Group B and A performed significantly better than group C on station 1 and 2 .,3
Gender factor did not seem to influence the score .,3
A total of 99 % students reported that combination of the 2 teaching modes is the best option .,3
"They believed it offers more clear understanding with interest ( 61 % ) , long term memory ( 21 % ) , use of both senses ; seeing & hearing ( 10 % ) & better focus of attention ( 3 % ) .",3
"Even half an hour of movie-based simulation training with traditional instructor-based training may improve student performance significantly , and the students prefer a combination of the both .",4
"Out of 283 eligible patients who achieved a pCR , 40 ( 14.1 % ) and 28 ( 9.9 % ) presented an event of interest for the RFI and DRFI analyses , respectively .",3
"Five-year RFI , DRFI and overall survival ( OS ) were 85.3 % ( 95 % confidence interval ( CI ) , 80.1-89 .3 ) , 89.6 % ( 95 % CI , 85.0-92 .9 ) and 91.9 % ( 95 % CI , 87.2-94 .9 ) , respectively .",3
No predictors for RFI after pCR were identified .,3
"For DRFI , tumour size was the only predictor : Hazard ratio ( HR ) T3 versus T1-2 = 3.62 ( 95 % CI , 1.66-7 .89 ) ; HR T4 versus T1-2 : HR , 2.80 ( 95 % CI , 0.62-12 .64 ) p = 0.0048 .",3
"In this study , clinical tumour size emerged as the only predictor for DRFI after pCR , with T3 and T4 tumours having an increased risk for distant recurrence compared to T1-2 tumours .",4
Intra-rater reliability using novice raters for the two applications ranged from an intraclass correlation coefficient ( ICC ) of 0.79 to 0.81 with SG at 0.82 .,3
Inter-rater reliability ( novice/expert ) for the two applications ranged from an ICC of 0.92 to 0.94 with SG at 0.91 .,3
Concurrent validity ( when compared to SG ) ranged from 0.93 to 0.94 .,3
There were no significant differences between the novice and experienced raters .,3
Both applications were found to be reliable and comparable to SG .,4
A photo-based application potentially offers a superior method of measurement as visualizing the landmarks may be simplified in this format and it provides a record of measurement .,4
Further study using patient populations may find the two studied applications are useful as an adjunct for clinical practice .,4
Thirteen infants were enrolled ; 1 died 3 months after birth .,3
One laser-treated eye progressed to stage 5 retinal detachment .,3
The remaining 23 eyes had favorable structural results at the 9-month follow-up and provided FA results .,3
"At 9 months of age , all eyes treated with a bevacizumab injection were noted to have abnormalities at the periphery ( large avascular area , abnormal branching , shunt ) or the posterior pole ( hyperfluorescent lesion , absence of foveal avascular zone ) .",3
These posterior and peripheral lesions were not observed in the majority of the lasered eyes .,3
This study documents significant vascular and macular abnormalities of eyes in the bevacizumab group .,4
Long-lasting implications of these abnormalities for visual function of the child need to be studied .,4
"The trial is now in the implementation phase and a number of threats to successful completion , such as recruitment and retention challenges in a vast , rural geographic area , have been addressed .",4
The protocol provides a unique model for oral health interventions using principles of community-based participatory research and is currently on schedule to meet study objectives .,4

There was no difference between the groups regarding demographic characteristics and perioperative course .,3
"SSI was diagnosed in 8.2 % ( GCS group ) , 13.5 % ( collagen group ) , and 11.3 % ( control group ) of patients .",3
No significant difference was found among the groups .,3
The local administration of GCS showed no significant benefit regarding wound infection after standardized laparoscopic colorectal resections .,4
"However , there was a trend toward reduced SSI in the GCS group .",4
"Therefore , a larger trial or meta-analysis is necessary to validate this result .",4
All groups lost weight at 12 months ( CONTROL -4.5 kg vs. Fish -4.3 kg vs. Fish + S -3.3 kg ; p < 0.001 ) and percentage body fat (,3
Advice to consume 2 fish meals per week did not enhance the effects on weight loss of a healthy low calorie diet .,4
One hertz rTMS led to attenuation of the underlying auditory cortex response to the stimulus and a contralateral increase in cortical activity .,3
Subanalysis of the auditory tasks demonstrated that rTMS effects varied with stimulus frequency and differences between the active and sham conditions were lost at the highest frequency .,3
"This work is , to the best of our knowledge , the first to neuroimage the effects of a `` hallucinatory rTMS protocol '' on basic auditory processing in healthy controls .",4
Our data demonstrated that a so-called `` inhibitory paradigm '' can also produce distal neuronal activation and that effects can vary with neural loading .,4
"These results highlight the insufficient knowledge of the effects of rTMS on normal physiology , and this , combined with a lack of consensus on clinical trial parameters , may be contributing to the ambivalent data in therapeutic trials .",4
"Citalopram treatment was associated with a larger increase in QTc interval than placebo ( difference in week 3 QTc adjusting for baseline QTc : 18.1 ms [ 95 % CI : 6.1 , 30.1 ] ; p = 0.004 ) .",3
"More participants in the citalopram group had an increase 30 ms from baseline to week 3 ( 7 in citalopram versus 1 in placebo ; Fisher 's exact p = 0.046 ) , but only slightly more in the citalopram group met a gender-specific threshold for prolonged QTc ( 450 ms for males ; 470 ms for females ) at any point during follow-up ( 3 in citalopram versus 1 in placebo , Fisher 's exact p = 0.611 ) .",3
One of the citalopram participants who developed prolonged QTc also displayed ventricular bigeminy .,3
No participants in either group had a cardiovascular-related death .,3
Citalopram at 30 mg/day was associated with improvement in agitation in patients with AD but was also associated with QT prolongation .,4
"From April 12 , 2007 , to Aug 19 , 2010 , in Italy , and from Jan 30 , 2009 , to Jan 10 , 2012 , in France , 121 patients with CJD were enrolled in the study , 62 of whom were randomly assigned to the treatment group and 59 to the placebo group .",3
"The first interim analysis showed absence of superiority of doxycycline compared with placebo , and the trial was stopped for futility .",3
"Efficacy analyses did not show significant differences between patients treated with doxycycline and placebo with regard to survival times ( HR 1.1 , 95 % CI 0.8-1 .7 , p = 0.50 ) .",3
"Serious adverse events were judged not to be related to treatment , whereas a relation was deemed probable or possible for five non-serious adverse events that occurred in each treatment group .",3
"Doxycycline at a dose of 100 mg per day was well tolerated but did not significantly affect the course of CJD , at variance with the results of previous observational studies .",4
Our experience could be useful in the design of large multinational controlled trials of potential anti-prion molecules in this rare disease .,4
"Baseline serum TT and FT , but not E2 or SHBG levels had small , but statistically significant associations with validated measures of sexual desire , erectile function , and sexual activity .",3
"None of these hormones was significantly associated within or across trials with FACIT-Fatigue , PHQ-9 Depression or Physical Function-10 scores , or gait speed .",3
"FT and TT levels were consistently , independently , and positively associated , albeit to a small degree , with measures of sexual desire , erectile function , and sexual activity , but not with measures of vitality or physical function in symptomatic older men with low T who qualified for the TTrials .",4
Statistical significant difference was found in the antimicrobial efficacy of NaOCl 2.5 % and BioPure MTAD when compared to saline ( p > 0.05 ) .,3
"However , no statistical significant difference was found between the efficacies of both the irrigants .",3
"NaOCl 2.5 % and BioPure MTAD , both irrigants are equally efficient against E. faecalis in necrotic primary anterior teeth .",4
"MTAD is a promising irrigant , however clinical studies are required to establish it as ideal root canal irrigant in clinical practice .",4
"Pulp exposure occurred in 2 and 27.5 % of teeth treated with PCR and TCR , respectively ( p < 0.01 ) .",3
The operative time was significantly higher for TCR than PCR .,3
"Success rates were 92 and 96 % in the PCR and TCR groups , respectively ( p = 0.34 ) .",3
The success rate tended to be lower in occlusoproximal ( 92 % ) than in occlusal ( 100 % ) lesions ( p = 0.08 ) .,3
"The clinical and radiographic success rates of PCR and TCR in primary teeth with deep carious lesions were high and did not differ significantly , indicating that PCR is a reliable minimally invasive approach in primary teeth and that the retention of carious dentin does not interfere with pulp vitality .",4
"Moreover , PCR provided other clinically relevant advantages over TCR , especially lower incidence of pulp exposure and lower operative time .",4
"222 women were randomised to receive allopurinol ( ALLO , n = 111 ) or placebo ( CONT , n = 111 ) .",3
Cord S100 was not significantly different between the two groups : 44.5 pg/mL ( IQR 20.2-71 .4 ) in the ALLO group versus 54.9 pg/mL ( IQR 26.8-94 .7 ) in the CONT group ( difference in median -7.69 ( 95 % CI -24.9 to 9.52 ) ) .,3
Post hoc subgroup analysis showed a potential treatment effect of allopurinol on the proportion of infants with a cord S100 value above the 75th percentile in girls ( ALLO n = 5 ( 12 % ) vs CONT n = 10 ( 31 % ) ; risk ratio ( RR ) 0.37 ( 95 % CI 0.14 to 0.99 ) ) but not in boys ( ALLO n = 18 ( 32 % ) vs CONT n = 15 ( 25 % ) ; RR 1.4 ( 95 % CI 0.84 to 2.3 ) ) .,3
"Also , cord neuroketal levels were significantly lower in girls treated with allopurinol as compared with placebo treated girls : 18.0 pg/mL ( 95 % CI 12.1 to 26.9 ) in the ALLO group versus 32.2 pg/mL ( 95 % CI 22.7 to 45.7 ) in the CONT group ( geometric mean difference -16.4 ( 95 % CI -24.6 to -1.64 ) ) .",3
Maternal treatment with allopurinol during fetal hypoxia did not significantly lower neuronal damage markers in cord blood .,4
Post hoc analysis revealed a potential beneficial treatment effect in girls .,4
Patients with IBS scored significantly higher on all aspects of alexithymia compared with healthy controls .,3
"The severity of pain decreased significantly in both groups , with a larger percentage of the patients in the EMT group who completed the study having a significant decrease in pain ( 54 % in the EMT group vs. 36 % in the MT group ) ; this finding was replicated in an intent-to-treat analysis .",3
"The same results were observed for frequency of pain in patients who completed the study ( 59 % in the EMT group vs 43.4 % in the MT group ) , but this finding was not replicated in an intent-to-treat analysis .",3
"These patterns were not influenced by level of alexithymia , age , or gender .",3
Adding emotional awareness training to medical treatment resulted in a better therapeutic response in abdominal pain in patients with IBS .,4
Misorientation of the split toric lenses caused a statistically significant drop in visual acuity ( F = 70.341 ; p < 0.001 ) .,3
"Comparatively better acuities were observed around 180 , as anticipated ( F = 3.775 ; p = 0.035 ) .",3
"Misaligning the split toric power produced no benefit in visual acuity retention with axis misorientation when subjects had astigmatism induced with a low ( F = 2.190 , p = 0.129 ) or high cylinder ( F = 0.491 , p = 0.617 ) or in the adapted astigmats ( F = 0.120 , p = 0.887 ) .",3
"Misalignment of toric lens power split across the front and back lens surfaces had no beneficial effect on distance visual acuity , but also no negative effect .",4
"Pain thresholds and testosterone levels were significantly lower under anxiety than at rest for all participants ( n = 46 ) , while cortisol levels , pain ratings , and anxiety ratings were significantly higher under anxiety than at rest .",3
"In the spring ( n = 25 ) , testosterone levels were significantly higher at rest than under anxiety , while there was no difference in cortisol levels between resting and anxiety conditions .",3
"In the summer ( n = 21 ) , cortisol levels were significantly higher under anxiety than at rest , while there was no difference in testosterone levels between resting and anxiety conditions .",3
There were no significant seasonal differences in pain and anxiety ratings and pain threshold .,3
These results indicate that seasonal differences in testosterone and cortisol levels under anxiety and at rest may affect pain responses .,4
These results also suggest that acute clinical pain may be relieved by managing anxiety that is related to a decrease of testosterone in spring and a large increase of cortisol in summer .,4
"Of the 934 patients randomised ( QVA149 = 476 and TIO+FOR = 458 ) , 87.9 % completed the study .",3
"At week 26 , non-inferiority was met for SGRQ-C ( QVA149 vs TIO+FOR ; difference : -0.69 units ; 95 % CI -2.31 to 0.92 ; p = 0.399 ) .",3
A significantly higher percentage of patients achieved a clinically relevant 1 point improvement in TDI total score with QVA149 ( 49.6 % ) versus TIO+FOR ( 42.4 % ; p = 0.033 ) .,3
"QVA149 significantly increased pre-dose FEV1 ( +68 mL , 95 % CI 37mL to 100mL ; p < 0.001 ) and FVC ( +74 mL , 95 % CI 24mL to 125mL ; p = 0.004 ) compared with TIO+FOR at week 26 .",3
The incidence of adverse events was comparable between both treatments ( QVA149 = 43.7 % and TIO+FOR = 42.6 % ) .,3
"QVA149 is non-inferior to TIO+FOR in improving HRQoL , with clinically meaningful and significant improvements in breathlessness and lung function in patients with COPD .",4
"We enrolled a total of 827 patients from South Africa , Zimbabwe , Botswana , and Zambia ; 28 % of patients were coinfected with the human immunodefiency virus .",3
"In the per-protocol analysis , the proportion of patients with an unfavorable response was 4.9 % in the control group , 3.2 % in the 6-month group ( adjusted difference from control , -1.8 percentage points ; 90 % confidence interval [ CI ] , -6.1 to 2.4 ) , and 18.2 % in the 4-month group ( adjusted difference from control , 13.6 percentage points ; 90 % CI , 8.1 to 19.1 ) .",3
"In the modified intention-to-treat analysis these proportions were 14.4 % in the control group , 13.7 % in the 6-month group ( adjusted difference from control , 0.4 percentage points ; 90 % CI , -4.7 to 5.6 ) , and 26.9 % in the 4-month group ( adjusted difference from control , 13.1 percentage points ; 90 % CI , 6.8 to 19.4 ) .",3
The 6-month regimen that included weekly administration of high-dose rifapentine and moxifloxacin was as effective as the control regimen .,4
The 4-month regimen was not noninferior to the control regimen .,4
"( Funded by the European and Developing Countries Clinical Trials Partnership and the Wellcome Trust ; RIFAQUIN Current Controlled Trials number , ISRCTN44153044 . )",4
This semiblinded trial include a high number of patients compared to existing randomized trials in this field .,4
"To our knowledge and according to ClinicalTrials.gov , this is the first study that compare these two treatments for a displaced proximal humeral fracture in elderly patients .",4
This may provide important information to help the surgeon to decide the best treatment in the future .,4
No differences in performance of the peg-transfer and intracorporeal knot-tying tasks were seen across ambient conditions .,3
"Assessed via use of the six bipolar scales of the SURG-TLX , we found differences in task workload between the hot and cold conditions in the areas of physical demands ( hot 10 [ 3-12 ] , cold 5 [ 2.5-9 ] , P = .013 ) and distractions ( hot 8 [ 3.5-15 .5 ] , cold 3 [ 1.5-5 .5 ] , P = .001 ) .",3
Participant perception of distraction remained greater in the hot condition on full scoring of the SURG-TLX .,3
Increasing ambient temperature to levels advocated for prevention of intraoperative hypothermia does not greatly decrease technical performance in short operative tasks .,4
"Surgeons , however , do report increased perceptions of distraction and physical demand .",4
The impact of these findings on performance and outcomes during longer operative procedures remains unclear .,4
"The results for 336 patients ( Daikenchuto , n = 174 ; placebo , n = 162 ) were available for statistical analysis .",3
The time to first bowel movement did not differ significantly between the two groups .,3
"All patients reported having diarrhea or soft stools immediately after surgery , and the time until stool normalization ( 50th percentile ) in the Daikenchuto and placebo groups was 6 days and 7 days , respectively .",3
"The placebo group had a significantly greater number of hard stools at post-operative day 8 ( P = 0.016 ) , and bowel movement frequency continued to increase until post-operative day 8 as well .",3
"In contrast , bowel movement frequency in the Daikenchuto group increased until post-operative day 6 , however decreased from post-operative day 7 and was significantly lower at post-operative day 8 compared with the placebo group ( P = 0.024 ) .",3
The moderate effects of Daikenchuto were observed 1 week after the operation .,4
"Although Daikenchuto had an effect on gastrointestinal function after open surgery in patients with colon cancer , this study did not show its clinical benefits adequately .",4
Correlations between clinical variables and disability were largely in line with the fear-avoidance model .,3
Regression analyses identified a significant contribution of fear-avoidance beliefs to baseline disability but not to disability at 3 months .,3
"Patients with subacromial pain syndrome were studied ; therefore , the results should be transferred with caution to other diagnoses .",4
"A modified version of the Fear-Avoidance Beliefs Questionnaire was used , which was not validated for this patient group .",4
Fear-avoidance beliefs contribute significantly to baseline disability but not to disability change scores after 3-month follow-up .,4
Duration of complaints and baseline disability were the main factors influencing disability change scores .,4
"Although the results help to improve understanding of the role of fear-avoidance beliefs , further studies are needed to fully understand the influence of psychological and clinical factors on the development of disability in patients with subacromial shoulder pain .",4
The overall 30-day mortality was 5 % .,3
"Within 90 days after operation , 8 % of the patients died .",3
The rates of 30-day and 90-day mortality were significantly higher in patients with high preoperative C-reactive protein values ( p = 0.001 and p < 0.0005 ) .,3
The spirometry values forced expiratory volume in 1 second and forced vital capacity exhaled ( FVCex ) were both associated with 30-day and 90-day mortality ( p = 0.001 and p < 0.0005 ; and p = 0.002 and p < 0.0005 ) .,3
"Major morbidity occurred in 30 % of the patients , significantly more often after right-sided EPP ( p = 0.01 ) and after longer operations ( p < 0.0005 ) .",3
Empyema ( p < 0.0005 ) and acute respiratory distress syndrome ( p = 0.02 ) were associated with longer duration of operation .,3
EPP after induction chemotherapy is a demanding procedure but can be performed with acceptable morbidity and mortality if patients are well selected and treated at dedicated high-volume MPM centers .,4
64 adults were enrolled ; 56 participants ( 28 in each group ) had baseline and follow up measures and were included in the intention to treat ( ITT ) analyses .,3
"43 participants completed the study , 21 in the active lubiprostone and 22 in the active Senna group .",3
"The mean age of the participants was 71.5 years ( SD = 11.4 years , range : 28-96 years ) .",3
"In the ITT analyses , participants showed significant improvement in bowel symptoms as measured by the PAC-SYM ( mean SD , -0.28 0.60 , range : -1 -2.33 ) and PAC-QOL ( mean SD , 0.33 0.81 , range : -1.5 -2.0 ) over time , but there were no significant differences between the lubiprostone and Senna groups in mean change in the PAC-SYM ( -0.20 0.60 vs -0.36 0.61 , P = 0.61 respectively ) or the PAC-QOL ( 0.29 0.76 vs 0.37 0.87 , P = 0.61 respectively ) .",3
"The mean change in each bowel symptom also did not significantly differ between treatment groups on ITT analyses , except for completeness of bowel movement , with the Senna group showing greater negative mean change in bowel movement completeness ( -0.56 1.01 vs -2.00 1.41 , P = 0.03 ) and for reduction of abdominal pain , favoring Senna ( -0.14 0.73 vs -0.73 1.08 , P = 0.04 ) .",3
Fifteen ( 75 % ) participants in the lubiprostone and in the Senna group requested rescue treatments .,3
"Participants made significant functional improvement from admission to discharge over a median LOS of 12 d , with a mean FIM change of 29.13 13.58 and no significant between group differences ( 27.0 9.2 vs 31.5 16.6 , P = 0.27 ) .",3
"Both lubiprostone and Senna improved constipation-related symptoms and QOL in opioid-induced constipation , with no significant between-group differences .",4
"Of 5135 students screened , 3422 scored 4 or greater and were randomized , and 83 % were followed up .",3
There was a significant effect on 1 of the 6 prespecified outcomes .,3
"Relative to control participants , those who received intervention consumed less alcohol per typical drinking occasion ( median 4 drinks [ interquartile range { IQR } , 2-8 ] vs 5 drinks [ IQR 2-8 ] ; rate ratio [ RR ] , 0.93 [ 99.17 % CI , 0.86-1 .00 ] ; P = .005 ) but not less often ( RR , 0.95 [ 99.17 % CI , 0.88-1 .03 ] ; P = .08 ) or less overall ( RR , 0.95 [ 99.17 % CI , 0.81-1 .10 ] ; P = .33 ) .",3
"Academic problem scores were not lower ( RR , 0.91 [ 99.17 % CI , 0.76-1 .08 ] ; P = .14 ) and effects on the risks of binge drinking ( odds ratio [ OR ] , 0.84 [ 99.17 % CI , 0.67-1 .05 ] ; P = .04 ) and heavy drinking ( OR , 0.77 [ 99.17 % CI , 0.56-1 .05 ] ; P = .03 ) were not significantly significant .",3
"In a sensitivity analysis accounting for attrition , the effect on alcohol per typical drinking occasion was no longer statistically significant .",3
A national web-based alcohol screening and brief intervention program produced no significant reductions in the frequency or overall volume of drinking or academic problems .,4
There remains a possibility of a small reduction in the amount of alcohol consumed per typical drinking occasion .,4
"When the dose of radiation was over 60 Gy , complete response rates of nasopharyngeal tumor and lymph node metastases in treatment group were significantly higher than in the control group ( 93.5 % vs 77.8 % ; 89.1 % vs 93.5 % , p < 0.05 ) .",3
"Three months after radiotherapy , complete response rate of nasopharynx cancer and lymph node metastases in treatment group was both 97.8 % , again higher than in the control group ( 84.4 % and 82.2 % ) ( p < 0.05 ) .",3
"In the treatment group , 1 , 3 , 5 year disease-free survival rates were 95.7 % , 86.7 % and 54.5 % ; and in control group , the corresponding disease-free survival rates were 93.3 % , 66.2 % and 38.6 % , respectively , the difference being statistically significant ( log-rank = 5.887 , p = 0.015 ) .",3
"One , 3 , 5 year overall survival rates in two groups of patients were 97.8 % , 93.5 % , 70.4 % and 95.5 % , 88.07 % , 48.4 % , respectively , again with a statistically significant difference ( log-rank = 6.470 , p = 0.011 ) .",3
Acute toxicity and long-term radiotherapy related toxicity in the two groups did not differ ( p > 0.05 ) .,3
Glycididazole sodium could improve curative effects without increasing adverse reactions when treating patients with locally advanced nasopharyngeal carcinoma .,4
Symptom outcomes will be assessed and estimates of cost-effectiveness made .,4

Median 2-week postinfection VL was 4.74 and 4.45 log copies per milliliter in women assigned to tenofovir gel ( n = 32 ) and placebo gel ( n = 51 ) ( P = 0.189 ) .,3
Corresponding 12-month postinfection VLs were 4.24 and 3.70 log copies per milliliter ( P = 0.016 ) .,3
"After adjusting for clinical and behavioral characteristics and protective HLA alleles , mean VLs within the first 2 years were 4.51 and 4.02 log copies per milliliter in women from the tenofovir and placebo arms ( P = 0.013 ) .",3
"Among women with vaginal tenofovir measurements , mean VLs were 4.53 and 4.60 log copies per milliliter in those with detectable versus undetectable levels ( P = 0.840 ) .",3
Overall mean CD4 counts were 463 and 514 cells per microliter in women assigned to tenofovir and placebo ( P = 0.290 ) .,3
"Thirty-two women ( 38.6 % ) reached CD4 counts of < 350 cells per microliter at median 9.4 months postinfection , 13 ( 40.6 % ) from the tenofovir and 19 ( 37.3 % ) from the placebo arms ( P = 0.786 ) .",3
Tenofovir gel had no impact on postinfection CD4 counts or the rate of CD4 decline .,4
"Although seroconvertors from the tenofovir arm experienced higher VLs , this did not result in a need for earlier antiretroviral therapy .",4
"After 6 weeks of robotic training , walking speed significantly increased for both groups , with no significant differences in walking speed gains observed between the 2 groups .",3
"In addition , 6-minute walking distance and balance significantly improved for the assistance group but not for the resistance group .",3
Applying a controlled resistance or an assistance load to the paretic leg during treadmill training may induce improvements in walking speed in individuals poststroke .,4
Resistance training was not superior to assistance training in improving locomotor function in individuals poststroke .,4
"Arterial blood pressure , heart rate , and cardiac output decreased equally , central circulation time and systemic vascular resistance increased significantly but similarly .",3
"Central blood volume , plasma volume and arterial compliance were unaltered .",3
"The QTc interval and renin levels decreased in the carvedilol group , however not significantly different from the propranolol group .",3
Arterial oxygen saturation and alveolar arterial oxygen gradient remained constant in both groups .,3
"Hepatic venous pressure gradient decreased equally in the carvedilol and propranolol groups ( -17 % and -20 % , non significant ) .",3
Systemic haemodynamics and pulmonary effects of carvedilol and propranolol are modest and this study could not demonstrate any significant difference between the two treatments .,4
Primary outcome was in-hospital all-cause mortality .,3
One hundred nine patients were included in the final analysis and 88 patients ( 80.7 % ) were HIV positive .,3
Pulmonary infections were the most common source of sepsis .,3
"In-hospital mortality rate was 64.2 % in the intervention group and 60.7 % in the control group ( relative risk , 1.05 ; 95 % CI , 0.79-1 .41 ) .",3
Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex was isolated from 31 of 82 HIV-positive patients ( 37.8 % ) with available mycobacterial blood culture results .,3
"Patients in Simplified Severe Sepsis Protocol received significantly more IV fluids in the first 6 hours ( 2.7 L vs 1.7 L , p = 0.002 ) .",3
"The study was stopped early because of high mortality rate among patients with hypoxemic respiratory failure in the intervention arm ( 8/8 , 100 % ) compared with the control arm ( 7/10 , 70 % ; relative risk , 1.43 ; 95 % CI , 0.95-2 .14 ) .",3
Factors other than tissue hypoperfusion probably account for much of the end-organ dysfunction in African patients with severe sepsis .,4
Studies of fluid-based interventions should utilize inclusion criteria to accurately capture patients with hypovolemia and tissue hypoperfusion who are most likely to benefit from fluids .,4
Exclusion of patients with severe respiratory distress should be considered when ventilatory support is not readily available .,4
The response rate was 74 % ( n = 621/844 ) .,3
"Of all the respondents , 39 % scored in the range for significant distress .",3
"Distress varied by follow-up cytology result : negative , 36 % ; BNA or mild dyskaryosis , 42 % ; other ( including high grade and inadequate ) , 55 % .",3
"After adjusting for the cytology result , risk of distress was significantly raised in women who had significant anxiety at recruitment , reported experiencing pain after the follow-up cytology , had children , or were dissatisfied with support they had received after their initial BNA test .",3
"Substantial proportions of women experience surveillance-related psychologic distress after a follow-up cytology test , even when the result is negative .",4
"This is an important , albeit unintended , consequence of cervical screening .",4
Strategies to alleviate this distress merit attention .,4
40 of 263 children ( 15 % ) were atopic .,3
Overall VAS had no significant effect on the risk of atopy ( Prevalence Ratio 1.23 ; 95 % CI 0.69-2 .18 ) .,3
The Prevalence Ratio was 1.60 ( 0.66-3 .90 ) for males and 1.00 ( 0.46-2 .15 ) for females .,3
There was no significant effect of VAS in infancy on atopy later in childhood .,4
The role of infant VAS in the development of atopy is still unclear .,4
"In the 4-week monotherapy studies , dupilumab resulted in rapid and dose-dependent improvements in clinical indexes , biomarker levels , and the transcriptome .",3
"The results of the 12-week study of dupilumab monotherapy reproduced and extended the 4-week findings : 85 % of patients in the dupilumab group , as compared with 35 % of those in the placebo group , had a 50 % reduction in the EASI score ( EASI-50 , with higher scores in the EASI indicating greater severity of eczema ) ( P < 0.001 ) ; 40 % of patients in the dupilumab group , as compared with 7 % in the placebo group , had a score of 0 to 1 ( indicating clearing or near-clearing of skin lesions ) on the investigator 's global assessment ( P < 0.001 ) ; and pruritus scores decreased ( indicating a reduction in itch ) by 55.7 % in the dupilumab group versus 15.1 % in the placebo group ( P < 0.001 ) .",3
"In the combination study , 100 % of the patients in the dupilumab group , as compared with 50 % of those who received topical glucocorticoids with placebo injection , met the criterion for EASI-50 ( P = 0.002 ) , despite the fact that patients who received dupilumab plus glucocorticoids used less than half the amount of topical glucocorticoids used by those who received placebo plus the topical medication ( P = 0.16 ) .",3
"Adverse events , such as skin infection , occurred more frequently with placebo ; nasopharyngitis and headache were the most frequent adverse events with dupilumab .",3

"No differences in parental feeding practices , parenting , quality of life , child sleep , or behavior were observed .",3
"Frequent , low-dose support was effective for reducing excessive weight in predominantly mild to moderately overweight children over a 2-year period .",4
Such initiatives could feasibly be incorporated into primary care .,4
"Treatment with MEM 1414 abrogated the late phase response with a mean difference in FEV1 ( LAR 3-10 hours ) of 104ml ( 25 % ) vs placebo ( p < 0.005 ) , with no effect on the early response .",3
Biomarker responses were also attenuated with MEM 1414 treatment with reductions in LPS-stimulated whole blood assays for TNF at 8hours ( p < 0.03 ) and LTB4 at 24hours ( p = 0.0808 ) with no change in the IL-6 response .,3
The MEM 1414 treatment phase was associated with higher incidence of nausea ( 6/16 MEM 1414 vs 2/16 placebo ) and vomiting ( 3/16 vs 0/16 placebo ) .,3
"Oral MEM 1414 , a novel PDE4 inhibitor , significantly reduces the late response following inhaled allergen challenge .",4
MEM 1414 also inhibited whole blood assays of cytokine production from inflammatory cells .,4

"Instructions that the e-cigarette contained nicotine were found to reduce both intention to smoke ( p = 0.017 ) and withdrawal-related ( p = 0.018 ) craving , regardless of a-priori reported beliefs regarding the relative importance of nicotine .",3
"Nicotine content instructions were also found to be associated with a shorter latency to self-administration ( p = 0.005 ) ; however , a SexInstructionsResponse Expectancy interaction ( p = 0.008 ) revealed that this effect was specific to women who had strong a-priori nicotine content craving relief expectations .",3
Neither nicotine content instructions nor response expectancies impacted the number of puffs self-administered .,3
"Findings suggest that nicotine content expectations contribute to smokers ' responses to e-cigarettes , and that a-priori beliefs about nicotine effects may be especially important in women .",4

Cognitive behavioral and psychodynamic therapies are both evidence-based approaches that are routinely offered to panic disordered patients in Sweden .,4
"However , little is known about the relative effectiveness of these two approaches for panic/agoraphobia , work-related disability and healthcare utilization over the longer term .",4
The current trial ( POSE ) also addresses the important but understudied issue of whether patient preference for a particular psychotherapeutic approach moderates outcome .,4
"In the SGB group , BIS values and OAA/S scores significantly decreased after the intervention as compared to baseline ( P < 0.05 ) .",3
The values were also significantly decreased in the SGB group when compared to the values in sham group after the intervention ( P < 0.05 ) .,3

There were no differences in heart rate during study period between groups .,3
This study is limited by a relatively small sample size .,4
"This study showed that SGB has a sedative effect in normal healthy volunteers , as evidenced by decreased OAA/S scores and BIS values .",4
The results showed that 333 respondents ( 82.4 % ) believed that herbal medicines are safe for use and only 39 ( 9.7 % ) held the view that they may not be safe .,3
RESULTS also show that 51 ( 12.6 % ) of respondents had experienced adverse effects while 250 ( 61.9 % ) said they had never experienced adverse effects from the use of herbal medicines .,3
Herbal medicine is popular among the respondents but they appear to be ignorant of its potential toxicities .,4
It may be necessary to educate the consumers of herbal medicines on the potentials for herbs-drugs interaction and adverse effects specially as a result of indiscriminate and unguided use of herbal medicines .,4
"Of 457 index admissions in 328 participants , 85 ( 19 % ) were followed by an early readmission .",3

"For participants taking multivitamins during the study , the highest intake of dietary folate was associated with an increased risk of mild posterior subcapsular lens opacity development .",3
No statistically significant associations were found between lutein plus zeaxanthin intake and presence at baseline or development of nuclear or cortical lens opacity outcomes .,3
These findings are consistent with earlier studies suggesting that dietary intake of B vitamins may affect the occurrence of age-related lens opacities .,4
Further investigations are warranted .,4
"Two hours after treatment , 26 of 112 patients ( 23 % ) from the placebo arm had a clinically significant improvement in pain versus 38 of 112 ( 34 % ) from the antivenom arm ( difference in favor of antivenom 10.7 % ; 95 % confidence interval -1.1 % to 22.6 % ; P = .10 ) .",3
Systemic effects resolved after 2 hours in 9 of 41 patients ( 22 % ) in the placebo arm and 9 of 35 ( 26 % ) in the antivenom arm ( difference 3.8 % ; 95 % confidence interval -15 % to 23 % ; P = .79 ) .,3
There was no significant difference in any secondary outcome between antivenom and placebo .,3

"At least one additional adenoma was detected on second withdrawal in similar proportions ( 10.5 % FV and 7.5 % RV , P = 0.13 ) .",3
"Predictors of identifying adenomas on the second withdrawal included older age ( odds ratio ( OR ) = 1.04 , 95 % confidence interval ( CI ) = 1.01-1 .08 ) , adenomas seen on initial withdrawal ( OR = 2.8 , 95 % CI = 1.7-4 .7 ) , and low endoscopist confidence in quality of first examination of the right colon ( OR = 4.8 , 95 % CI = 1.9-12 .1 ) .",3
There were no adverse events .,3
Retroflexion in the right colon can be safely achieved in the majority of patients undergoing colonoscopy for colorectal cancer screening .,4
"Reexamination of the right colon in either retroflexed or forward view yielded similar , incremental ADRs .",4
"A second exam of the right colon should be strongly considered in patients who have adenomas discovered in the right colon , particularly when endoscopist confidence in the quality of initial examination is low .",4

MI rates increased within 90 days of prasugrel cessation after both 12 and 30 months treatment .,3
"Composite Global Utilization of Streptokinase and Tissue Plasminogen Activator for Occluded Coronary Arteries ( GUSTO ) moderate or severe bleeds were modestly increased ( 2.4 % versus 1.7 % ; HR , 1.438 ; P = 0.234 ) but severe bleeds were not more frequent ( 0.3 % versus 0.5 % ; HR , 0.549 ; P = 0.471 ) in the prolonged treatment group .",3
Prasugrel and aspirin continued for 30 months reduced ischemic events for the TAXUS Libert paclitaxel-eluting stent patient subset from DAPT through reductions in MI and stent thrombosis .,4
Withdrawal of prasugrel was followed by an increase in MI after both 12 and 30 months therapy .,4
"The optimal duration of dual antiplatelet therapy with prasugrel after TAXUS Libert paclitaxel-eluting stent remains unknown , but appears to be > 30 months .",4
"An abrupt pressure decrease at the moment of exiting the LF or entering the ES was more frequently observed when using the paramedian approach ( P < 0.05 ) with the odds ratio of 4.96 ( 95 % CI , 1.63 - 15.12 ) as compared with the midline approach .",3
A correlation between the abrupt pressure decrease and LOR tactile sensation has been assumed .,4
"Under the assumption that the LOR sensation is due to an abrupt decrease in pressure the moment the needle enters the ES or exits the LF , this study claims that the accuracy of accessing the cervical ES can be improved significantly using the paramedian approach .",4
"HAMD score was reduced in the 1st , 2nd and 4th weeks of treatment as compared with that before treatment in the combined therapy group ( all P < 0 01 ) .",3
HAMD score was reduced in the 2nd and 4th weeks of treatment as compared with that before treatment in the medication group ( all P < 0.01 ) .,3
"HAMD scores in the combined therapy group were lower than those in the medication group in the 1st , 2nd and 4th weeks of treatment ( all P < 0.01 ) .",3
"Before treatment , in the combined therapy group and the medication group , the levels of serum 5-HT , IL-4 and IL-10 were all lower than those in the healthy group ( all P < 0.01 ) ; the levels of IL-1 and IL-6 were higher than those in the healthy group ( all P < 0.01 ) .",3
"In the combined therapy group and the medication group , the levels of 5-HT , IL-4 and IL-10 in 4 weeks of treatment were all increased as compared with those before treatment ( all P < 0.01 ) , and the levels of IL-1 and IL-6 were lower than those before treatment ( all P < 0.01 ) .",3
"In the combined therapy group , the levels of IL-1 and IL-6 in 4 weeks of treatment were lower than those in the medication group , and the levels of 5-HT , IL-4 and IL-10 were higher than those in the medication group ( P < 0.01 , P < 0.05 ) .",3
"The combined therapy of acupuncture and SSRIs achieves much quicker and more effective re - ' sult for relieving depression in the patients of depressive disorder as compared with simple oral administration of ' SSRIs , and much more contributes to adjust the imbalance of serum 5-HT and TH1/TH2 .",4
No difference in terms if operative time was found between 2D or 3D laparoscopy for both the PY ( P = .51 ) and the PN ( P = .28 ) procedures .,3
"A better rate in terms of surgical performance score was noted by the tutors when the study participants were using 3D vs 2D , for both PY ( 3.6 [ 0.8 ] vs 3.0 [ 0.4 ] ; P = .034 ) and PN ( 3.6 [ 0.51 ] vs 3.15 [ 0.63 ] ; P = .001 ) .",3
No complications occurred in any of the procedures .,3
Most ( 77.2 % ) of the participating nave laparoscopic surgeons had the perception that 3D laparoscopy was overall easier than 2D .,3
"Headache ( 18.1 % ) , nausea ( 18.1 % ) , and visual disturbance ( 18.1 % ) were the most common issues reported by the surgeons during 3D procedures .",3
"Despite the absence of translation in a shorter operative time , the use of 3D technology seems to facilitate the surgical performance of nave surgeons during laparoscopic kidney procedures on a porcine model .",4
Seventeen ( 8.4 % ) adverse events were recorded ( 2 % major complications ) .,3
Exophytic development and smaller size were protective against adverse events .,3
"Complete ablation was obtained in 87 % RM ( 93 % 3 cm , 89 % 4 cm ) .",3
T1a threshold was a positive predictor for complete ablation and central location a negative one .,3
Three - and 5-year overall survival were 84 and 75 % ; cancer-specific survival 96 and 91 % ; and disease-free survival 80 and 75 % .,3
"Considering only the 79 patients with newly diagnosed renal cell carcinoma , T1a disease stage resulted a positive predictor for both overall survival ( 87 and 83 % at 3 and 5 years ) and cancer-specific survival ( 100 % at 5 years ) .",3
"RFA of noncentral small RM is safe and effective , and it provides favorable long-term oncological outcomes .",4
"Selection criteria for RFA can also include T1a renal cell carcinoma in patients without surgical contraindications , even though randomized controlled trials are needed to establish the best treatment .",4
Eight-one fractures had data accurately recorded ( 38 EM/43 FH ) .,3
"The average total operative time was 50 minutes ( range , 25-88 minutes ; SD , 13.9 minutes ) for the FH group and 57 minutes ( range , 40-103 minutes ; SD , 16.12 minutes ) for the EM group .",3
"The average time for distal locking was 10 minutes ( range , 4-16 minutes ; SD , 3.56 minutes ) with FH and 11 minutes ( range , 6-28 minutes ; SD , 10.24 minutes ) with EM .",3
"Average radiation dose for distal locking was significantly less ( P < 0.0001 ) for EM at 230.54 Gy ( range , 51-660 Gy ; SD , 0.17 Gy ) compared with 690.27 Gy ( range , 200-2310 Gy ; SD , 0.52 Gy ) for FH .",3
There were 2 misplaced drill bits in FH and 3 in EM .,3
This was not statistically significant ( P = 0.888 ) .,3
"The electromagnetic targeting device ( Sureshot ) significantly reduced radiation exposure during placement of distal interlocking screws , without sacrificing operative time , and was equivalent in accuracy when compared with the FH technique .",4
The control group showed significantly better clinical survival after 18 months ( p = 0.0025 ) .,3
"In both groups , no caries progression was registered on the radiographic evaluations .",3
"Sealing had similar efficacy in the arrestment of caries progression of cavitated occlusal lesions compared to partial excavation of the lesions , even though the frequency of re-treatments was significantly higher in sealed lesions .",4
We found no statistically significant differences in outcomes by original treatment group over the 10 years .,3
"Those whose care remained with ACT , or transferred to ACT or forensic services , had more inpatient days over the 10 years ( coefficient 223 , 95 % CI 83 to 363 , p = 0.002 ) than those whose care remained with the CMHTs or were discharged to primary care .",3
"Being subject to a Community Treatment Order was associated with a greater chance of being under ACT at 10 year follow-up ( OR 6.39 , 95 % CI 2.98 to 13.70 , p < 0.001 ) .",3
The ACT teams in this study showed no clinical advantage over usual care provided by CMHTs at 10 year follow-up .,4
We also found that the ACT teams accrued patients from the original study sample who had more complex needs than those who remained with or transferred to the CMHTs or primary care during this period .,4
Further well conducted trials are needed to identify the most cost-effective approaches to supporting successful community living and optimum long term outcomes for this group .,4
"This study will be most relevant for organizations and occupational settings where some degree of job flexibility , leeway , and decision-making autonomy can be afforded to affected workers .",4
The study design will provide initial assessment of a novel workplace approach and to understand factors affecting its feasibility and effectiveness .,4
206/250 participants ( 82 % ) were vitamin D insufficient at baseline .,3
"Vitamin D3 did not influence time to first severe exacerbation ( adjusted HR 1.02 , 95 % CI 0.69 to 1.53 , p = 0.91 ) or first URI ( adjusted HR 0.87 , 95 % CI 0.64 to 1.16 , p = 0.34 ) .",3
No clinically important effect of vitamin D3 was seen on any of the secondary outcomes listed above .,3
The influence of vitamin D3 on coprimary outcomes was not modified by baseline vitamin D status or genotype .,3
Bolus-dose vitamin D3 supplementation did not influence time to exacerbation or URI in a population of adults with asthma with a high prevalence of baseline vitamin D insufficiency .,4
"After 22 weeks , although the changes in the estimated glomerular filtration rate and blood pressure were not significant , the percent change in the serum urate level ( -45.38 vs. -0.08 % , P < 0.0001 ) and the percent change in urinary albumin-to-creatinine ratio ( -33.0 vs. -6.0 % , P = 0.0092 ) were found to have decreased in the topiroxostat as compared with the placebo .",3
"Although the incidence of ` alanine aminotransferase increased ' was higher in the topiroxostat , serious adverse event rates were similar in the two groups .",3
Topiroxostat 160 mg effectively reduced the serum urate level in the hyperuricemic stage 3 chronic kidney disease patients with or without gout .,4
There were 70 patients ( 35 in each group ) .,3
Mean age was 36.1 years in patients undergoing ligation of the intersphincteric fistula track vs 32.9 years in patients undergoing mucosal advancement flap ( p = 0.33 ) .,3
"Mean visual analog scale after 1 week was significantly higher in the mucosal advancement flap group than in the ligation of intersphincteric fistula track group ( 3.1 vs 4.8 , p = 0.04 ) , but no significant difference was found after 4 weeks .",3
Primary healing was achieved in 33 patients undergoing ligation of the intersphincteric fistula track vs 32 patients undergoing mucosal advancement flap ( p = 0.99 ) .,3
Mean healing time was 22.6 days in the ligation of intersphincteric fistula track group vs 32.1 days in mucosal advancement flap group ( p = 0.01 ) .,3
"After 1 year of follow-up , successful outcome was achieved in 26 patients ( 74.3 % ) undergoing ligation of intersphincteric fistula track and in 20 patients ( 65.7 % ) undergoing mucosal advancement flap ( p = 0.58 ) .",3
No significant change in Wexner score occurred 4 weeks postoperatively .,3
There was no significant difference between groups regarding Cleveland Global Quality of Life score ( p = 0.5 and 0.07 after 4 and 12 weeks ) .,3
The short-term follow-up is a probable limitation .,4
"Although the sample size was calculated to detect difference with 80 % power at a significance level of 5 % , the negative result within this relatively small number of patients might have resulted from type II statistical error .",4
"In patients with high transsphincteric anal fistulas , both ligation of intersphincteric fistula track procedure and mucosal advancement flap have a similar long-term healing rate , recurrences , continence , and quality of life .",4
"However , ligation of the intersphincteric fistula track has the advantage of less postoperative pain .",4
"As predicted from previous research , patients who did not respond to a SSRI or dual therapy showed poorer word fluency than responders , whereas this was not seen for patients treated with bupropion alone .",3
"Longer choice reaction time ( RT ) was also found in nonresponders to a SSRI or dual therapy , but the opposite trend was seen for bupropion .",3
Using a combined index of word fluency and RT ( with normative performance as a cutoff ) yielded differential predictions of response .,3
"Equal to or above normal performance predicted good response to a SSRI or dual therapy , with high positive predictive value ( 90 % ) and specificity ( 78 % ) but lower sensitivity ( 53 % ) .",3
"In contrast , less than normal performance predicted good response to bupropion alone ( positive predictive value = 82 % ; specificity = 67 % ; sensitivity = 90 % ) .",3
"Relatively small sample size , no placebo control , and combining across SSRI alone and dual treatments .",4
"Although findings are preliminary due to small sample size , brief tests of word fluency and psychomotor speed may help identify depressed patients who are unresponsive to a serotonergic agent , but who may respond to bupropion alone .",4
From 51 children 102 stable anesthetics concentrations were obtained .,3
For all age groups Pk of aEEG to multiple of age adjusted MAC was < 0.72 indicating a poor predictive power for aEEG .,3
"In contrast for the SEF90 and BIS there was evidence for better predictive properties in children aged between 6 months and 2 years , with a Pk > 0.81 .",3
The aEEG is unlikely to be a useful measure of anesthesia depth in young children .,4
Both groups had 50 neonates each with similar baseline characteristics .,3
Heart rates were in normal range in both the groups .,3
The intervention group provided an average ( s.d. ) of 16.98 ( 0.28 ) h of SSC over the first 24h period .,3
The mean temperature was significantly high in the SSC group at all time intervals starting from 1 to 48h ( P < 0.05 for all ) .,3
"In the SSC group only two newborns ( 4 % ) had mild hypothermia ( cold stress ) , and , of these two newborns , one had two episodes of hypothermia .",3
All these three episodes of hypothermia occurred within first 3h of life .,3
In the control group 16 newborns ( 32 % ) developed hypothermia ( temperature < 36.5 C ) during first 48h of life .,3
"Of them , 11 newborns had single episode , 4 newborns had two episodes and one newborn had three episodes of hypothermia .",3
"Of these 22 hypothermic episodes , 20 occurred in the first 6h of life and 2 episodes occurred at 48h of life .",3
"Moderate hypothermia was seen in two newborns , whereas rest had mild hypothermia .",3
The relative risk of developing hypothermia in the control group as compared with the SSC group was 8.00 ( 95 % CI 1.94-32 .99 ) .,3
There was no seasonal variation in incidence of hypothermia in both the groups .,3
Newborns in the SSC group achieved rapid thermal control as compared with the control group .,4
Early SSC for 24h after birth decreases incidence of hypothermia for initial 48h of life .,4
Early SSC needs to be aggressively promoted in term and late-preterm newborns to reduce incidence of hypothermia .,4
All patients received the first injection .,3
150 patients also received the second and third injections .,3
97 % Of the paper and pencil pain diaries were returned for data analysis.The triamcinolone acetonide group showed the largest decrease in pain on the VAS scores after injection compared to the hyaluronic acid and NaCl group in the first week after injection .,3
"The reduction in pain was best achieved after the first injection , the second triamcinolone acetonide injection showed a further reduction in pain .",3
The third triamcinolone acetonide injection only showed a slight improvement in pain reduction .,3
In this study we could show a booster effect in pain reduction after repeated triamcinolone acetonide injection .,4
The triamcinolone acetonide group showed a faster reduction in pain after injection compared to the hyaluronic acid and NaCl group .,4
"The effect was best seen after the first and second triamcinolone acetonide injection , it is therefore questionable whether it is necessary to repeat triamcinolone acetonide injections more than two times .",4
Twenty-one infants completed the study .,3
The infants were born with a median EGA of 27 weeks and studied at a median age of 17 days and weight of 1.08 kg .,3
"Their median FiO2 was 0.32 ; 8 were intubated , and the rest noninvasively supported ( 7 positive pressure ventilation and 6 CPAP ) .",3
"The control in both arms was excellent , and required less than 2 manual FiO2 adjustments per day .",3
There were no differences in the three primary endpoints .,3
"The narrower/higher set control range resulted in tighter control ( IQR 3.0 vs. 4.3 p < 0.001 ) , and less time with the SpO2 between 80-86 ( 6.2 % vs. 8.4 % , p = 0.006 ) .",3
We found that a shift in the median of the set control range of an automated FiO2-SpO2 control system had a proportional effect on the median and distribution of SpO2 exposure .,4
We found that a dramatic narrowing of the set control range had a disproportionally smaller impact .,4
Our study points to the potential to optimize SpO2 targeting with an automated control system .,4
"Of the 186 participants , 53.7 % ( n = 100 ) were female , median BMI was 22.5 [ IQR : 20.4-27 .0 ] , 85.5 % ( n = 159 ) were Ad5 seropositive , and 18.8 % ( n = 35 ) drank heavily .",3
"All vaccine recipients responded to both clade B ( n = 87 ; 47 % ) and/or C ( n = 74 ; 40 % ) , p = 0.17 .",3
"In multivariate analysis , female sex [ Adjusted Odds Ratio ( AOR ) : 6.478 ; p = 0.0159 ] , overweight/obese BMI ( AOR : 0.186 ; p = 0.0452 ) , and heavy drinking ( AOR : 0.270 ; p = 0.048 ) significantly predicted immune response to clade C for any antigens .",3
A marginally significant predictor of clade C-pol antigen was female sex ( AOR : 3.182 ; p = 0.0500 ) .,3
"Sex , BMI , and heavy drinking affected vaccine-induced HIV-1 specific immune responses to clade C antigens .",4
"The role of female sex and overweight/obese BMI boosting and suppressing vaccine-induced HIV-1 specific immune responses , respectively , requires elucidation , including any effect on HIV vaccine efficacy , especially in the era of colliding epidemics ( HIV and obesity ) .",4
Explicit beliefs were influenced more when people perceived that others ' views were inconsistent with their own in a public setting than an anonymous setting or when they received trait prevalence feedback .,3
"However , levels of weight bias on a separate measure were unchanged .",3
"Strong , public manipulations of social feedback have great potential to impact , at least , the short-term expression of stereotypes towards obese people .",4
"In this randomized , double-blind , placebo-controlled study , 50 eligible patients with active mild to moderate UC were supplemented with either a 500-mg resveratrol or placebo capsule for 6 weeks .",3
"Serum inflammatory markers , activity of NF-B in peripheral blood mononuclear cells ( PBMC ) and quality of life were assessed at baseline and at the end of the study .",3
"Resveratrol supplementation led to a significant reduction in plasma levels of TNF - ( 19.70 12.80 to 17.20 10.09 pg/mL ) and hs-CRP ( 4764.25 2260.48 to 2584.50 1792.80 ng/mL ) and activity of NF-B in PBMCs ( 0.19 0.05 to 0.10 0.04 OD ) ( p < 0.001 ) , whereas there were no significant changes of these factors in placebo group .",3
"Also , the score of inflammatory bowel disease questionnaire -9 ( IBDQ-9 ) increased , whereas the clinical colitis activity index score decreased significantly in the resveratrol group ( 32.72 7.52 to 47.64 8.59 ) ( p < 0.001 ) and when compared with the placebo group ( 35.54 9.50 to 41.08 6.59 ) ( p < 0.001 ) .",3
Our results indicate that 6 weeks supplementation with 500 mg resveratrol can improve quality of life and disease clinical colitis activity at least partially through inflammation reduction in patients with UC .,4
Whether these effects will be continued in longer duration of treatment remains to be determined .,4
"Over 10 years , women with a history of GDM assigned to placebo had a 48 % higher risk of developing diabetes compared with women without a history of GDM .",3
"In women with a history of GDM , ILS and metformin reduced progression to diabetes compared with placebo by 35 % and 40 % , respectively .",3
"Among women without a history of GDM , ILS reduced the progression to diabetes by 30 % , and metformin did not reduce the progression to diabetes .",3
Women with a history of GDM are at an increased risk of developing diabetes .,4
"In women with a history of GDM in the DPP/Diabetes Prevention Program Outcomes Study , both lifestyle and metformin were highly effective in reducing progression to diabetes during a 10-year follow-up period .",4
"Among women without a history of GDM , lifestyle but not metformin reduced progression to diabetes .",4
"Patients from racial/ethnic minority groups , patients with lower income , and patients with lower educational attainment gave trainees higher ratings on the end-of-life care subscale of the QOC ( QOCeol ) .",3
"In path models , patient educational attainment and income had a direct effect on outcomes , while race/ethnicity did not .",3
"Lower family educational attainment was also associated with higher trainee ratings on the QOCeol , while family non-white race was associated with lower trainee ratings on the QEOLC and general subscale of the QOC .",3
"Patient race is associated with perceptions of the quality of communication about end-of-life care provided by physicians-in-training , but the association was opposite to our hypothesis and appears to be mediated by socioeconomic status .",4
Family member predictors of these perceptions differ from those observed for patients .,4
Further investigation of these associations may guide interventions to improve care delivered to patients and families .,4
We found no differences in pain between the 20-second and 60-second roller-massager conditions .,3
"During 60 seconds of roller massage , pain was 13.5 % ( 5.7 0.70 ) and 20.6 % ( 6.2 0.70 ) greater at 40 seconds and 60 seconds , respectively , than at 20 seconds ( P < .05 ) .",3
"During roller massage , VL and biceps femoris root mean square ( RMS ) EMG was 8 % and 7 % , respectively , of RMS EMG recorded during maximal voluntary isometric contraction .",3
"Knee-joint ROM was 10 % and 16 % greater in the 20-second and 60-second roller-massager conditions , respectively , than the control condition ( P < .05 ) .",3
"Finally , average lunge VL RMS EMG decreased as roller-massage time increased ( P < .05 ) .",3
"Roller massage was painful and induced muscle activity , but it increased knee-joint ROM and neuromuscular efficiency during a lunge .",4
This trial will determine the effects of antibiotic mixing and cycling on the unit-wide prevalence of ARGNB in ICUs .,4
"Acute and chronic inflammation and both were detected in 46 baseline biopsies ( 1 % ) , 3931 baseline biopsies ( 63 % ) , and 892 baseline biopsies ( 14 % ) , respectively .",3
Acute and chronic inflammation were found to be significantly associated with each other ( P < .001 ) .,3
"Acute inflammation at baseline biopsy was associated with younger age , lower prostate-specific antigen levels , and a smaller prostate ( all P < .01 ) , whereas chronic inflammation was associated with older age and larger prostate glands ( all P < 0.01 ) .",3
"At the 2-year biopsy , the prevalence of PCa was 14 % ( N = 900 patients ) .",3
"On univariable and multivariable analysis , both acute and chronic inflammation were found to be significantly associated with a lower PCa risk ( acute univariable : odds ratio [ OR ] , 0.65 [ P < .001 ] and multivariable : OR , 0.75 [ P = .012 ] and chronic univariable : OR , 0.61 [ P < .001 ] and multivariable : OR , 0.65 [ P < .001 ] ) .",3
"At the time of 4-year biopsy , only acute inflammation was found to be associated with a lower PCa risk .",3
Baseline acute and chronic inflammation were both found to be independently associated with a lower PCa risk .,4
"From a clinical standpoint , inflammation in negative biopsies for PCa may lower the risk of subsequent PCa detection .",4
"Mean activity limitation and quality of life at baseline were 30.1 ( SD , 12.5 ) and 0.51 ( SD , 0.24 ) , respectively , for advice and 30.2 ( SD , 13.2 ) and 0.54 ( SD , 0.24 ) for rehabilitation , increasing to 64.3 ( SD , 13.5 ) and 0.85 ( SD , 0.17 ) for advice vs 64.3 ( SD , 15.1 ) and 0.85 ( SD , 0.20 ) for rehabilitation at 3 months .",3
"Rehabilitation was not more effective than advice for activity limitation ( mean effect at 3 months , 0.4 [ 95 % CI , -3.3 to 4.1 ] ) or quality of life ( -0.01 [ 95 % CI , -0.06 to 0.04 ] ) .",3
Treatment effects were not moderated by fracture severity or age and sex .,3
A supervised exercise program and advice did not confer additional benefits in activity limitation or quality of life compared with advice alone for patients with isolated and uncomplicated ankle fracture .,4
These findings do not support the routine use of supervised exercise programs after removal of immobilization for patients with isolated and uncomplicated ankle fracture .,4
"A total of 142 mild heroin dependence patients performed the experiments ( including 48 in the Ji-Tai tablet group , 48 in the Ji-Tai tablet with buprenorphine group and 46 in the control group ) .",3
"The scores of baseline withdrawal symptoms were 43.52019.786 , 42.64017.648 and 47.10024.450 , respectively , with no significant differences among the 3 groups ( all P > 0.05 ) .",3
"During the 10-day treatment , the reduction rate of acute withdrawal symptoms scores increased daily , the acute withdrawal syndrome scores and the anxiety symptoms scores declined from day 0 to day 10 , there was also no significant difference among the 3 groups ( all P > 0.05 ) .",3
"Ji-Tai tablet did not affect vital signs such as blood pressure , heart rate , and respiration rate .",3
Ji-Tai tablet or Ji-Tai tablet combined with buprenorphine had no effect on acute withdrawal symptoms of mild heroin dependence .,4
"We enrolled 16 healthy Asian men between Sept 28 and Dec 28 , 2012 , and randomly assigned 13 to one or five doses of F ( ab ' ) and three to placebo .",3
"F ( ab ' ) was well tolerated , and no deaths or serious adverse events occurred .",3
"Three patients had mild adverse events ( one each of blepharospasm , sinusitis , and pyrexia ) .",3
"The pyrexia ( 38C ) was regarded as probably related to the infusion , and resolved after 37 min .",3
"Our laboratory assessments of blood and urine samples and physical examinations of heart rate , electrocardiogram readings , and weight showed no clinically significant safety issues .",3
Mean peak plasma concentrations were 193 g/mL ( SD 35 ) with the one dose schedule and 230 g/mL ( 45 ) with the five-dose schedule .,3
F ( ab ' ) were still detectable in plasma on average up to 5 days after five doses .,3
"Haemagglutination inhibition was only increased after the third dose , but in-vitro seroneutralisation activity was transiently increased after each of the five doses to concentrations regarded as clinically beneficial in infected patients .",3
"F ( ab ' ) showed good safety , tolerability , and therapeutic potential for managing of H5N1 exposed patients .",4
"Compared with placebo , IMT increased maximal inspiratory pressure ( +34 % 43 % , P = 0.008 ) , diaphragm thickness at residual volume ( +38 % 39 % , P = 0.03 ) , and peak inspiratory flow ( +35 % 42 % , P = 0.049 ) but did not change other spirometry measures , plasma cytokine concentrations , DNA damage levels in peripheral blood mononuclear cells , dynamic inspiratory muscle function , inspiratory muscle endurance , exercise performance , PAL , or QoL .",3
"These novel data indicate that in healthy older adults , IMT elicits some positive changes in inspiratory muscle function and structure but neither attenuates systemic inflammation and oxidative stress nor improves exercise performance , PAL , or QoL .",4
"In total , 23 women agreed to participate in the study and 16 women completed the intervention .",3
The results showed that the behavioral medicine in physical therapy intervention was feasible .,3
No effects were seen on the primary effect outcomes .,3
The experimental intervention seemed to improve the level of physical activity and self-efficacy for exercise .,3
Some of the participants in both groups perceived that they could manage their everyday life in a better way after participation in the study .,3
"Results from this study are encouraging , but the study procedure and interventions have to be refined and tested in a larger feasibility study to be able to evaluate the effects of these kinds of interventions on pain-related disability , pain-related beliefs , self-efficacy in everyday activities , and morale in the target group .",4
"Further research is also needed to refine and evaluate effects from individualized reminder routines , support to collect self-report data , safety procedures for balance training , and training of personnel to enhance self-efficacy .",4
A total of 51 subjects completed the study .,3
The PK profile of cilnidipine was not significantly affected by coadministered valsartan ; the geometric mean ratio and 90 % confidence interval ( 90 % CI ) of AUC ( last ) for cilnidipine with and without valsartan was 1.04 ( 0.98-1 .10 ) .,3
"Likewise , cilnidipine did not affect the PK of valsartan ; the geometric mean ratio ( 90 % CI ) of AUC ( last ) for valsartan with and without cilnidipine was 0.94 ( 0.83-1 .07 ) .",3
Coadministration of cilnidipine and valsartan reduced blood pressure in an additive way .,3
"No serious AEs were reported , and both cilnidipine and valsartan were well tolerated .",3
"Coadministered cilnidipine and valsartan do not cause a significant PK or PD interaction , and they are well tolerated .",4
The mean ( SD ) IOP before washout was 18.5 ( 4.0 ) mm Hg .,3
"The mean increase in IOP after washout , using the mean of the 3 measurements , was 5.3 ( 4.2 ) mm Hg .",3
"The percentage of eyes in which the increase in IOP using a single postwashout IOP differed from the increase in IOP using the mean of 3 measurements by more than 1.5 mm Hg was 35.1 % , 25.6 % , 34.2 % , 30.0 % , and 31.4 % when the single measurement was made at 8 am , 12 pm , 4 pm , a randomly chosen single measure of those 3 times , and the time closest to that of the prewashout IOP , respectively .",3
"By logistic regression , the 12 pm postwashout IOP had the lowest proportion of eyes differing from the mean ( P < .001 ) and thus most closely approximated the mean diurnal IOP .",3
"Although eliminating multiple IOP measurements would simplify the conduct of surgical trials in glaucoma , our data show that using a single IOP measurement after washout does not adequately approximate the mean of multiple IOP measurements .",4
"The VAS for pain , DASH score , Oxford Elbow Score , modified Mayo score , and hand grip strength all improved significantly from pre-injection to the 6-month follow-up in the PRP and CS groups .",3
"However , in the CS group , the scores generally peaked at 3 months and then deteriorated slightly at 6 months indicating recurrence of symptoms , which involved 46.7 % of the CS patients .",3
"At 6 months , the number of patients positive for various ulrasonographic findings generally decreased .",3

"Of 400 patients randomized , 396 were included in the intent-to-treat ( ITT ) population ( PBO n = 98 , BRV 5 mg/day n = 97 , BRV 20 mg/day n = 100 , BRV 50 mg/day n = 101 ) and 392 comprised the modified ITT ( mITT ) population .",3
A total of 361 ( 91.2 % ) of 396 patients completed the study .,3
Most patients ( 78.3 % ) were receiving two concomitant AEDs .,3
"Percent reduction in partial-onset seizure frequency/week over PBO was -0.9 % ( p = 0.885 ) for BRV 5 mg/day , 4.1 % ( p = 0.492 ) for BRV 20 mg/day , and 12.8 % ( p = 0.025 ) for BRV 50 mg/day ( mITT population ) .",3
Statistical significance was also achieved for the percent reduction over PBO in baseline-adjusted partial-onset seizure frequency/28 days for BRV 50 mg/day ( 22.0 % ; p = 0.004 ) but not for the other BRV dose groups .,3
"In the BRV 50 mg/day group , statistical significance was also seen for the 50 % responder rate ( BRV 32.7 % vs. PBO 16.7 % ; p = 0.008 ) and median percent reduction from baseline in partial-onset seizure frequency/week ( BRV 30.5 % vs. PBO 17.8 % ; p = 0.003 ) .",3
"In the exploratory subanalysis by seizure subtype , median percent reduction from baseline in seizure frequency/week and 50 % responder rate were numerically greater than PBO in the BRV 20 and 50 mg/day groups for simple partial , complex partial , and secondarily generalized seizures .",3
"BRV was generally well tolerated , with the majority of TEAEs being mild-to-moderate in intensity .",3
"Of the TEAEs reported by 5 % patients , those with a frequency > 3 % higher than PBO for any dose of BRV compared with PBO were somnolence , dizziness , fatigue , influenza , insomnia , nasopharyngitis , vomiting , diarrhea , urinary tract infection , and nausea .",3
Adjunctive BRV at a daily dose of 50 mg was associated with statistically significant reductions in seizure frequency compared with PBO .,4
All doses of BRV showed good tolerability throughout the study .,4
"The estimated incidence of HIV in the intervention group was 1.52 % versus 1.81 % in the control group with an estimated reduction in HIV incidence of 13.9 % ( relative risk [ RR ] 0.86 , 95 % CI 0.73-1 .02 ; p = 0.082 ) .",3
"HIV incidence was significantly reduced in women older than 24 years ( RR = 0.70 , 0.54-0 .90 ; p = 0.0085 ) , but not in other age or sex subgroups .",3
"Community-based voluntary counselling and testing increased testing rates by 25 % overall ( 12-39 ; p = 0.0003 ) , by 45 % ( 25-69 ; p < 00001 ) in men and 15 % ( 3-28 ; p = 0.013 ) in women .",3
No overall effect on sexual risk behaviour was recorded .,3
Social norms regarding HIV testing were improved by 6 % ( 95 % CI 3-9 ) in communities in the intervention group .,3
"These results are sufficiently robust , especially when taking into consideration the combined results of modest reductions in HIV incidence combined with increases in HIV testing and reductions in HIV risk behaviour , to recommend the Project Accept approach as an integral part of all interventions ( including treatment as prevention ) to reduce HIV transmission at the community level .",4
All subjects completed the study according to protocol .,3
Most subjects had high levels of baseline measles antibody .,3
No adverse events were reported .,3
MVDP produced serologic responses similar to subcutaneous vaccination .,3
MVDP was well tolerated in all subjects .,4
"Most subjects had high baseline measles antibody titer which limited ability to measure the serologic responses , and may have limited the adverse events following vaccination .",4
Additional studies in subjects without pre-existing measles antibody are needed to further elucidate the safety and immunogenicity of MVDP .,4
A total of 120 hospitalized patients scheduled for diagnostic colonoscopy were randomized .,3
"The mean total Ottawa score was slightly superior for the morning-only arm , and the upper bound of 95 % confidence interval ( CI ) for difference between arms was less than our prespecified noninferiority margin of 1.5 ( difference = -0.23 ; 95 % CI , -1.72 to 1.25 ) .",3
The percentage of patients with good bowel preparation was similar for all colonic segments .,3
There was a trend toward more side effects among patients in the morning-only compared with the split-dose arm ( 71 % vs. 54 % ; P = 0.08 ) .,3
"Compared with morning-only preparation , more patients in the split-dose arm were willing to undergo similar preparation for future colonoscopies ( 71 % vs. 89 % ; P = 0.02 ) .",3
Morning-only PEG is not inferior to split-dose preparation regarding bowel cleansing efficacy for colonoscopy in hospitalized patients .,4
"However , split-dose preparation was preferred by patients because of less side effects .",4
"Three themes were abstracted from the data , reflecting carers ' beliefs about the usefulness of the manual : promoting carers ' well-being , increasing carers ' understanding of and support for the young person with first-episode psychosis , and accessibility and delivery modes of the programme .",3
This process evaluation highlights that guided self-help is useful in informing and supporting carers of affected young people .,4
"While there is scope for broadening the delivery modes , the approach is easy to use and accessible , and can be used as a cost-effective adjunct to standard support provided to carers , by community mental health nurses and other clinicians .",4
One hundred subjects were enrolled ( 25 each to 7 - and 14-day regimens with probiotic or placebo ) .,3
Antibiotic susceptibility tests showed 36.7 % metronidazole and 1.1 % clarithromycin resistance .,3
"CYP2C19 genotyping revealed 40.8 % , 49 % and 10.2 % were rapid , intermediate and poor metabolizers , respectively .",3
The eradication rates of 7 - or 14 regimens with probiotics were 100 % .,3
"Regarding adverse events , the incidence of bitter taste was significantly lower in the 7 - day regimen with the probiotic group compared with 7 - day regimen with placebo ( 40 % vs. 64 % ; p = 0.04 ) .",3
"The 7-day standard triple therapy plus bismuth and probiotic can provide an excellent cure rate of H. pylori ( 100 % ) in areas with low clarithromycin resistance such as Thailand , regardless of CYP2C19 genotype .",4
Adding a probiotic also reduced treatment-related adverse events .,4
The interim analysis included 81 patients with at least 1 year follow-up .,3
Sixty-three patients ( 65 % ) were culture-positive .,3
"Safety analysis : 7 eyes were eviscerated ( 3 dexamethasone , 4 placebo ) ; 4 eyes had no light perception ( 2 dexamethasone , 2 placebo ) ; and 4 eyes had less than 5/200 vision ( 3 dexamethasone , 1 placebo ) .",3
Treatment outcome : 70 % of patients had a visual acuity of at least 20/40 .,3
The safety analysis does not warrant premature discontinuation of the study .,4
"So far , the overall outcome of our treatment regimen , consisting of merely a diagnostic biopsy instead of a vitrectomy and an optimized antibiotic dosing , compares favourably to published literature .",4
"Multivariate linear regression indicated that both IPT ( b = .41 , p < .05 ) and medication ( b = .47 , p < .05 ) yielded a significant reduction in suicide symptoms compared to placebo on the HRSD .",3
Multivariate linear regression indicated that after adjustment for change in depression these treatment effects were no longer significant .,3
Moderate Cohens d effect sizes from baseline to post-test differences in suicide score by treatment group are reported .,3
These analyses were completed on a single suicide item from each of the measures .,4
"Moreover , the TDCRP excluded participants with moderate to severe suicidal ideation .",4
"This study demonstrates the specific effectiveness of IPT and medications in reducing suicidal ideation ( relative to placebo ) , albeit largely as a consequence of their more general effects on depression .",4
"This adds to the growing body of evidence that depression treatments , specifically IPT and medication , can also reduce suicidal ideation and serves to further our understanding of the complex relationship between depression and suicide .",4
"At baseline , log NT-proBNP did not differ between treatment arms and was correlated with baseline log ISI ( p < 0.0001 ) and WC ( p = 0.0003 ) but not with BMI ( p = 0.39 ) .",3
"After 2 years of treatment , BMI decreased in the lifestyle and metformin groups ( both p < 0.0001 ) ; WC decreased in all three groups ( p < 0.05 for all ) ; and log ISI increased in the lifestyle and metformin groups ( both p < 0.001 ) .",3
The change in log NT-proBNP did not differ in the lifestyle or metformin group vs the placebo group ( p > 0.05 for both ) .,3
"In regression models , the change in log NT-proBNP was positively associated with the change in log ISI ( p < 0.005 ) in all three study groups after adjusting for changes in BMI and WC , but was not associated with the change in BMI or WC after adjusting for changes in log ISI .",3
Circulating NT-proBNP was associated with a measure of insulin sensitivity before and during preventive interventions for type 2 diabetes in the DPP .,4
"This relationship persisted after adjustment for measures of adiposity and was consistent regardless of whether a participant was treated with placebo , intensive lifestyle intervention or metformin .",4
"The mean ( SD ) age was 61.4 ( 8.2 ) years , and the mean baseline frequency of incontinence was 2.5 ( 1.3 ) episodes/d .",3
"After 6 weeks , the total incontinence frequency decreased by 70 % ( 1.8 [ 0.9 ] fewer episodes/d ) in the yoga therapy versus 13 % ( 0.3 [ 1.7 ] fewer episodes/d ) in the control group ( P = 0.049 ) .",3
Participants in the yoga therapy group also reported an average of 71 % decrease in stress incontinence frequency ( 0.7 [ 0.8 ] fewer episodes/d ) compared with a 25 % increase in controls ( 0.2 [ 1.1 ] more episodes/d ) ( P = 0.039 ) .,3
No significant differences in reduction in urgency incontinence were detected between the yoga therapy versus control groups ( 1.0 [ 1.0 ] versus 0.5 [ 0.5 ] fewer episodes/d ; P = 0.20 ) .,3
All women starting the yoga therapy program completed at least 90 % of the group classes and practice sessions .,3
Two participants in each group reported adverse events unrelated to the intervention .,3
"Findings provide preliminary evidence to support the feasibility , efficacy , and safety of a group-based yoga therapy intervention to improve urinary incontinence in women .",4
"At long-term follow-up , there was no effect of any genotype , or gene gene interactions , on treatment response .",3
"In the subsamples , there was time by genotype interaction effects indicating an influence of the TPH2 G-703T-polymorphism on CBT short-term response , however the direction of the effect was not consistent across trials .",3
"None of the three gene variants , 5-HTTLPR , COMTval158met and TPH2 G-703T , was associated with long-term response to CBT for SAD .",4
"Experimental group showed statistically significant improvement ( P < 0.05 ) in stability in upright posture in eyes closed condition on firm surface , and in eyes open , closed , and dome conditions on foam .",3
No differences were observed between groups in the eyes open condition on firm surface nor in the sensory condition not addressed during the treatment .,3
After rehabilitation people with MS can recover from sensory impairments thus improving upright balance .,4
"Further , the improvement seems to be context-dependent and present just in the treated sensory conditions .",4
"There were no differences between experimental and control participants in BMI , weight , and waist circumference .",3
"There were small improvements in FVI ( P = .001 ) , vigorous PA in females ( P = .05 ) , fat intake ( P = .002 ) , self-instruction ( P = .001 ) , and regulation ( P = .004 ) for mealtime behavior , and hours of sleep ( P = .05 ) at postintervention , but improvements were not maintained at follow-up .",3
"At postintervention , a greater proportion of experimental participants were in the action/maintenance stages for FVI ( P = .019 ) and PA ( P = .002 ) than control .",3
Young Adults Eating and Active for Health is one of the first studies to use the community-based participatory research process of PRECEDE-PROCEED to develop a non-diet approach intervention .,4
"Although there were no differences between experimental and control participants in weight change or BMI , the intervention supported positive change in behaviors that may mediate excessive weight gain , such as increasing FVI and more healthful self-regulation mealtime behaviors immediately postintervention .",4
Additional strategies to maintain the behavior changes need to be explored .,4
"IQR increases in mean PM ( 2.5 ) ( 7.0 g/m ) and CO ( 161.7 parts per billion ) concentrations in the first 24h before the plasma nitrite measurement were associated with increased plasma nitrite concentrations ( PM ( 2.5 ) : 15.5 nanomolar ; 95 % confidence interval ( CI ) : 2.4 , 28.5 ; CO : 15.6 nanomolar ; 95 % CI : 2.4 , 28.9 ) .",3
Increased plasma nitrite associated with IQR increases in O and SO concentrations over longer lags were observed .,3
Rapid increases in plasma nitrite following exposure to ambient air pollutants support the hypothesis that ambient air pollution is associated with inducible nitric oxide synthase-mediated systemic inflammation in humans .,4
"73 % ( 166/228 ) of women in the outpatient group and 80 % ( 168/211 ) in the inpatient group reported successful treatment at six months ( intention to treat relative risk 0.91 , 95 % confidence interval 0.82 to 1.02 ; per protocol relative risk 0.92 , 0.82 to 1.02 ) .",3
"Failure to remove polyps was higher ( 19 % v 7 % ; relative risk 2.5 , 1.5 to 4.1 ) and acceptability of the procedure was lower ( 83 % v 92 % ; 0.90 , 0.84 to 0.97 ) in the outpatient group Quality of life did not differ significantly between the groups .",3
"Four uterine perforations , one of which necessitated bowel resection , all occurred in the inpatient group .",3
Outpatient polypectomy was non-inferior to inpatient polypectomy .,4
"Failure to remove a uterine polyp was , however , more likely with outpatient polypectomy and acceptability of the procedure was slightly lower .",4
PROVE IT-TIMI 22 enrolled 4162 subjects after an acute coronary syndrome ( ACS ) and randomized them to atorvastatin 80 mg/day versus pravastatin 40 mg/day .,3
"A-to-Z enrolled 4497 subjects after ACS and randomized them to a high-potency ( simvastatin 40 mg/day 1 months , then simvastatin 80 mg/day ) versus a delayed moderate-potency statin strategy ( placebo 4 months , then simvastatin 20 mg/day ) .",3
Serum creatinine was assessed centrally at serial time points .,3
Adverse events ( AEs ) relating to kidney injury were identified through database review .,3
"Across both trials , mean serum creatinine was similar between treatment arms at baseline and throughout follow-up .",3
"In A-to-Z , the incidence of a 1.5-fold or 0.3 mg/dL rise in serum creatinine was 11.4 % for subjects randomized to a high-potency statin regimen versus 12.4 % for those on a delayed moderate-potency regimen ( odds ratio [ OR ] , 0.91 ; 95 % confidence interval [ CI ] , 0.76 to 1.10 ; P = 0.33 ) .",3
"In PROVE IT-TIMI 22 , the incidence was 9.4 % for subjects randomized to atorvastatin 80 mg/day and 10.6 % for subjects randomized to pravastatin 40 mg/day ( OR , 0.88 ; 95 % CI , 0.71 to 1.09 ; P = 0.25 ) .",3
Consistent results were observed for different kidney injury thresholds and in individuals with diabetes mellitus or with moderate renal dysfunction .,3
"The incidence of kidney injury-related adverse events ( AEs ) was not statistically different for patients on a high-potency versus moderate-potency statin regimen ( OR , 1.06 ; 95 % CI , 0.68 to 1.67 ; P = 0.78 ) .",3
"For patients enrolled in 2 large randomized trials of statin therapy after ACS , the use of a high-potency statin regimen did not increase the risk of kidney injury .",4
MDSCs were characterized in HNSCC and their intratumoral presence significantly correlates with recurrence .,3
Tadalafil treatment was well tolerated and significantly reduced both MDSCs and Treg concentrations in the blood and in the tumor ( P < 0.05 ) .,3
"In addition , the concentration of blood CD8 ( + ) T cells reactive to autologous tumor antigens significantly increased after treatment ( P < 0.05 ) .",3
Tadalafil immunomodulatory activity was maximized at an intermediate dose but not at higher doses .,3
"Mechanistic analysis suggests a possible off-target effect on PDE11 at high dosages that , by increasing intracellular cAMP , may negatively affect antitumor immunity .",3
Tadalafil seems to beneficially modulate the tumor micro - and macro-environment in patients with HNSCC by lowering MDSCs and Tregs and increasing tumor-specific CD8 ( + ) T cells in a dose-dependent fashion .,4
TAZ showed stronger expression in primary cancer and lymph node metastasis compared to distant or adjacent normal mucosa in both non-RT and RT patients .,3
Strong TAZ expression was significantly higher in stages I-III and non-mucinious cancer of non-RT patients .,3
"In RT patients , strong TAZ expression in biopsy was related to distant recurrence , independent of gender , age , stages and grade ( p = 0.043 , HR , 6.160 , 95 % CI , 1.063-35 .704 ) .",3
"In silico protein-protein interaction study demonstrated that TAZ was positively related to oncoproteins , Livin , MAC30 and FXYD-3 .",3
"Strong expression of TAZ protein seems to be related to rectal cancer development and RT response , it can be a predictive biomarker of distant recurrence in patients with preoperative RT. .",4
"The two ticagrelor doses each reduced , as compared with placebo , the rate of the primary efficacy end point , with Kaplan-Meier rates at 3 years of 7.85 % in the group that received 90 mg of ticagrelor twice daily , 7.77 % in the group that received 60 mg of ticagrelor twice daily , and 9.04 % in the placebo group ( hazard ratio for 90 mg of ticagrelor vs. placebo , 0.85 ; 95 % confidence interval [ CI ] , 0.75 to 0.96 ; P = 0.008 ; hazard ratio for 60 mg of ticagrelor vs. placebo , 0.84 ; 95 % CI , 0.74 to 0.95 ; P = 0.004 ) .",3
"Rates of TIMI major bleeding were higher with ticagrelor ( 2.60 % with 90 mg and 2.30 % with 60 mg ) than with placebo ( 1.06 % ) ( P < 0.001 for each dose vs. placebo ) ; the rates of intracranial hemorrhage or fatal bleeding in the three groups were 0.63 % , 0.71 % , and 0.60 % , respectively .",3
"In patients with a myocardial infarction more than 1 year previously , treatment with ticagrelor significantly reduced the risk of cardiovascular death , myocardial infarction , or stroke and increased the risk of major bleeding .",4
"( Funded by AstraZeneca ; PEGASUS-TIMI 54 ClinicalTrials.gov number , NCT01225562 . )",4
"Implementing population interventions to prevent obesity is complex , costly and challenging .",4
"To address these barriers , evidence based interventions need to move beyond isolated efficacy trials and report outcomes related to effectiveness and implementation .",4
Large pragmatic trials provide an opportunity to inform both effectiveness and implementation leading to potential for greater impact at the population level .,4
Pragmatic trials should incorporate both effectiveness and implementation outcomes and a multidimensional methodology to inform scale-up to population level .,4
The learnings from this trial will impact on the design and implementation of population obesity prevention strategies nationally and internationally .,4
Real rTMS treatment was associated with a significant improvement in lower limb motor function .,3
This effect persisted over time ( follow-up ) and was significantly greater than that observed with sham stimulation .,3
"A significant increase in walking speed was also found after real rTMS , but this effect did not reach statistical significance in comparison with the sham stimulation .",3
"These data demonstrated that 3 weeks of high-frequency deep rTMS could induce long-term improvements in lower limb functions in the chronic poststroke period , lasting at least 1 month after the end of the treatment .",4
One hundred thirty-three patients received everolimus-erlotinib ( n = 66 ) or erlotinib alone ( n = 67 ) .,3
"The DCR at 3 months was 39.4 % and 28.4 % , respectively .",3
"The probability for the difference in disease control at 3 months to be 15 % was estimated to be 29.8 % , which was below the prespecified probability threshold of 40 % .",3
"Median PFS was 2.9 and 2.0 months , respectively .",3
"Grade 3/4 adverse events occurred in 72.7 % and 32.3 % of patients , respectively .",3
Grade 3/4 stomatitis was observed in 31.8 % of combination therapy recipients .,3
Everolimus 5 mg/day plus erlotinib 150 mg/day was not considered sufficiently efficacious per the predefined study criteria .,4
The combination does not warrant further investigation based on increased toxicity and the lack of substantial improvement in disease stabilization .,4
"Training in pregnancy did not affect the levels of cffDNA , cfmDNA or cftDNA .",3
"PCOS-women treated with metformin had lower levels of cfmDNA and cftDNA at week 32 ( mean SD : 301 162 versus 570 337 , p = 0.012 , 345 173 versus 635 370 , p = 0.019 ) ; otherwise the levels were comparable to PCOS-controls .",3
"Metformin-treated PCOS-women had higher cffDNA at inclusion , in the 1st trimester ; later on in pregnancy the levels in the metformin and placebo groups were equal .",3
"A comparison of pregnant women in the exercise study ( TRIP ) to placebo-treated pregnant PCOS-women , showed the levels of cffDNA , cfmDNA or cftDNA during mid-pregnancy ( weeks 18-36 ) to be equal .",3
"Training during pregnancy was not associated with altered levels of cffDNA cfmDNA or cftDNA , but metformin treatment may reduce cfmDNA and cftDNA in pregnant PCOS women .",4
"HP , but not HF , delayed eating initiation vs. NoS ( P < 0.05 ) .",3
Both snacks reduced appetite vs. NoS ( P < 0.001 ) with HP eliciting greater reductions than HF ( P < 0.05 ) .,3
Only HF led to reductions in corticolimbic activation in brain regions controlling food motivation/reward vs. NoS ( P < 0.01 ) .,3
"Although no treatment differences in daily energy intake were detected , HP led to greater protein consumption than NoS ( P < 0.05 ) and greater protein and lower fat consumption than HF ( both , P < 0.05 ) .",3
HP led to fewer HF/high-sugar evening snacks than NoS ( P < 0.01 ) and HF ( P = 0.09 ) .,3
"Although no treatment effects were detected for mood and cognition , HP tended to reduce confusion-bewilderment ( P = 0.07 ) and increase cognitive flexibility ( P = 0.09 ) , whereas NoS reduced tension-anxiety ( P < 0.05 ) and vigor-activity ( P < 0.05 ) .",3
"Afternoon snacking , particularly on HP soy foods , improves appetite , satiety , and diet quality in adolescents , while beneficially influencing aspects of mood and cognition .",4
This trial was registered at clinicaltrials.gov as NCT01781286 .,4
We observed that the results obtained regarding the pain reported at the end of procedures ( 2.51 1.4 for group A and 2.54 1.15 for group B ) and at the first evacuation ( 2.6 .1.52 for group A and 2.7 1.18 for group B ) are similar in both study groups .,3
"Instead , the mean score on overall satisfaction at 30 days from the treatment showed a statistical significance ( 8.32 1.72 for group A and 6.64 1.78 for group B ; p < 0.05 ) .",3
There were no reported other important issues .,3
Our results confirm the usefulness of Flavonoids to make more comfortable the post-treatment period .,4
"After two years , 79 repaired restorations were re-examined .",3
No statistically significant differences were found between the materials at baseline or at the 2-year recall ( p > 0.05 ) .,3
"Comparing baseline and 2-year recall , there was a statistically significant difference for marginal discoloration ( p = 0.029 ) in silorane-based composite restorations .",3
"After two years , the clinical performance of the silorane-based composite was similar to that of the dimethacrylate-based composite when used to make repairs .",4
Cerebral oxygen saturation values on the right side were higher in the sevoflurane group than in the TIVA group .,3
"The values on the left side were higher in the sevoflurane group than in the TIVA group , and meaningful differences were seen at the lowest temperature and at 36C .",3
Oxygen saturation was higher in the sevoflurane group than in the TIVA group .,4
"Thus , the effect of sevoflurane was useful for maintaining cerebral oxygen saturation during CBP .",4
"During a median of 5 years of follow-up , 1,031 ( 9 % ) patients died , 1,147 ( 10 % ) experienced a cardiovascular event , and 1,136 ( 10 % ) experienced a microvascular complication .",3
"Compared with patients who reported no alcohol consumption , those who reported moderate consumption had fewer cardiovascular events ( adjusted hazard ratio [ aHR ] 0.83 ; 95 % CI 0.72-0 .95 ; P = 0.008 ) , less microvascular complications ( aHR 0.85 ; 95 % CI 0.73-0 .99 ; P = 0.03 ) , and lower all-cause mortality ( aHR 0.87 ; 96 % CI 0.75-1 .00 ; P = 0.05 ) .",3
"The benefits were particularly evident in participants who drank predominantly wine ( cardiovascular events aHR 0.78 , 95 % CI 0.63-0 .95 , P = 0.01 ; all-cause mortality aHR 0.77 , 95 % CI 0.62-0 .95 , P = 0.02 ) .",3
"Compared with patients who reported no alcohol consumption , those who reported heavy consumption had dose-dependent higher risks of cardiovascular events and all-cause mortality .",3
"In patients with type 2 diabetes , moderate alcohol use , particularly wine consumption , is associated with reduced risks of cardiovascular events and all-cause mortality .",4
"Postoperative pain on day 1 was significantly lower in the polyurethane film group ( 2.05 vs. 0.79 , p = 0.035 ) as compared to the alginate group .",3
"This difference was not detected on day 5 ( 0.89 vs. 0.53 , p = 0.52 ) .",3
Time to epithelialization did not differ significantly between the two dressing groups .,3
There were more dressing changes in the polyurethane film group and problems with leakage .,3
"Whereas film dressings resulted in initially lower pain scores , alginate dressings caused fewer additional dressing changes and less leakage .",4
"Twelve out of 46 ( 26 % ) patients were reoperated within 2 years , nine out of 21 ( 43 % ) in the Biofix ( ) - group versus three out of 25 ( 12 % ) in the FasT-Fix ( ) - group ( p = 0.018 ) .",3
The relative risk of reoperation was 3.6 times higher for Biofix ( ) compared to FasT-Fix ( ) ( 95 % confidence interval 1.1-11 .5 ) .,3
"Both treatment groups had significant increase in all KOOS subscales , but there were no major differences between the groups .",3
The subgroup of reoperated patients differed from the other patients with higher Tegner score preoperatively ( median 5 vs. 4 ) ( p = 0.037 ) and at 3-month follow-up ( median 4 vs. 3 ) ( p = 0.010 ) .,3
These results indicate that FasT-Fix ( ) suture is superior to Biofix ( ) arrows with significant lower failure rate .,4
Functional outcome did not depend on repair technique .,4
Higher activity score preoperatively and at 3-month follow-up in the reoperated patients indicates that activity level may influence on the risk of reoperation .,4
"We observed more adaptive emotion regulation ( decreased use of suppression and increased use of reappraisal ) following ADM. Furthermore , the largest improvements in emotion regulation were associated with the best treatment outcomes .",3
"Because we assessed acute outcomes , it is not yet known if the effects of ADM on emotion regulation would persist over time .",4
"ADMs are associated with acute , adaptive changes in the psychobehavioral strategies used to regulate emotions .",4
The proportion of DBPCFCs considered inconclusive was comparable between the two strategy groups ( p = 0.791 ) .,3
"Participants in the symptoms first group were more likely to consider a DBPCFC as positive ( in 14 tests , 73.7 % ) than subjects in the key first group ( four tests , 21.1 % ) .",3
"The number of positive tests was higher in the symptoms first group ( median 50.0 % , interquartile range [ IQR ] 23.1-76 .9 % ) than in the key first groups ( 44.0 % , IQR 12.0-68 .0 % , p = 0.031 ) .",3
"This was independent of the participant 's profession ( pediatrician or other ) , age , gender , or years of experience ( p > 0.3 ) .",3
Clinicians differ in their interpretation of DBPCFC results when symptoms are ambiguous .,4
Opening the key of a DBPCFC before reviewing and interpreting symptoms significantly reduces the likelihood of the challenge being interpreted as positive .,4
Guidelines for performing DBPCFCs should standardize the moment of opening the challenge key .,4
"As expected , higher BFNE-R scores were related to more unpleasant responding to negative films , whereas higher FPES scores were related to more unpleasant responding to positive films .",3
"Furthermore , experience of pride following positive films correlated positively with BFNE-R , but negatively with FPES scores .",3
Participants were university students which limits representativeness .,4
The study revealed that measures of FNE and FPE show distinct relationships with positive and negative social feedback which provides further evidence for the BFOE model in a laboratory setting .,4
"After randomization , 4 patients were lost to follow-up , all after month 18 , and 1 withdrew due to an adverse event .",3
"During the 18-month treatment period , the primary outcome occurred in 6 of 184 patients ( 3.3 % ) in the warfarin group and in 25 of 187 ( 13.5 % ) in the placebo group ( hazard ratio [ HR ] , 0.22 ; 95 % CI , 0.09-0 .55 ; P = .001 ) .",3
"Recurrent venous thromboembolism occurred in 3 patients in the warfarin group and 25 patients in the placebo group ( HR , 0.15 ; 95 % CI , 0.05-0 .43 ) ; major bleeding occurred in 4 patients in the warfarin group and in 1 patient in the placebo group ( HR , 3.96 ; 95 % CI , 0.44 to 35.89 ) .",3
"During the 42-month entire study period ( including the study treatment and follow-up periods ) , the composite outcome occurred in 33 patients ( 20.8 % ) in the warfarin group and in 42 ( 24.0 % ) in the placebo group ( HR , 0.75 ; 95 % CI , 0.47-1 .18 ) .",3
"Rates of recurrent venous thromboembolism , major bleeding , and unrelated death did not differ between groups .",3
"Among patients with a first episode of unprovoked pulmonary embolism who received 6 months of anticoagulant treatment , an additional 18 months of treatment with warfarin reduced the composite outcome of recurrent venous thrombosis and major bleeding compared with placebo .",4
"However , benefit was not maintained after discontinuation of anticoagulation therapy .",4
"Seventy-four patients met the endpoint , `` invasive Candida infection , '' 40 in the high exposure arm and 34 in standard exposure arm ( relative risk = 1.2 ; 95 % CI , 0.7-1 .8 ; p = 0.52 ) .",3
"Among medical patients in the high exposure arm , the use of ciprofloxacin and piperacillin/tazobactam was 51 % and 75 % higher than in the standard exposure arm ; no difference in antibiotic exposure was observed between the randomized arms in surgical patients .",3
"Among medical intensive care patients , invasive Candida infection was more frequent in the high exposure arm ( 6.2 % ; 27/437 ) than in standard exposure arm ( 3.3 % ; 14/424 ) ( hazard ratio = 1.9 ; 95 % CI , 1.0-3 .6 ; p = 0.05 ) .",3
"Ciprofloxacin used at study entry independently predicted invasive Candida infection ( adjusted hazard ratio = 2.1 [ 1.1-4 .1 ] ) ; the risk gradually increased with duration of ciprofloxacin therapy : six of 384 in patients not exposed ( 1.6 % ) , eight of 212 ( 3.8 % ) when used for 1-2 days ( hazard ratio = 2.5 ; 95 % CI , 0.9-7 .3 ) , and 31 of 493 ( 6.3 % ) when used for 3 days ( hazard ratio = 3.8 ; 95 % CI , 1.6-9 .3 ; p = 0.002 ) .",3
"Patients with any ciprofloxacin-containing antibiotic regimen the first 3 days in the trial had a higher risk of invasive Candida infection than did patients on any antibiotic regimen not containing ciprofloxacin ( unadjusted hazard ratio = 3.7 ; 95 % CI , 1.6-8 .7 ; p = 0.003 ; adjusted hazard ratio , 3.4 ; 95 % CI , 1.4-8 .0 ; p = 0.006 ) .",3
High exposure to antibiotics is associated to increased risk of invasive Candida infection in medical intensive care patients .,4
Patients with ciprofloxacin-containing regimens had higher risk of invasive Candida infection .,4
"Other antibiotics , such as meropenem , piperacillin/tazobactam , and cefuroxime , were not associated with such a risk .",4
"Of 580 enrolled patients , 551 were evaluable : 273 received dexamethasone , and 278 received aprepitant .",3
Day 1 complete response rates were similar : 87.6 % for dexamethasone and 84.9 % for aprepitant ( P < .39 ) .,3
"From days 2 to 5 , complete response rates were the same with both antiemetic prophylaxes ( 79.5 % ; P < 1.00 ) , as were results of secondary end points ( ie , complete protection , total control , no vomiting , no nausea , score of Functional Living Index-Emesis ; P < .24 ) .",3
Incidences of insomnia ( 2.9 % v 0.4 % ; P < .02 ) and heartburn ( 8.1 % v 3.6 % ; P < .03 ) were significantly greater with dexamethasone on days 2 to 5 .,3
"In patients with breast cancer treated with anthracycline plus cyclophosphamide chemotherapy and receiving the same antiemetic prophylaxis for acute emesis , dexamethasone was not superior to aprepitant but instead had similar efficacy and toxicity in preventing delayed emesis .",4
"In the open-label phase , serum potassium levels declined from 5.6 mEq/L at baseline to 4.5 mEq/L at 48 hours .",3
"Median time to normalization was 2.2 hours , with 84 % of patients ( 95 % CI , 79 % -88 % ) achieving normokalemia by 24 hours and 98 % ( 95 % CI , 96 % -99 % ) by 48 hours .",3
"In the randomized phase , serum potassium was significantly lower during days 8-29 with all 3 zirconium cyclosilicate doses vs placebo ( 4.8 mEq/L [ 95 % CI , 4.6-4 .9 ] , 4.5 mEq/L [ 95 % CI , 4.4-4 .6 ] , and 4.4 mEq/L [ 95 % CI , 4.3-4 .5 ] for 5 g , 10 g , and 15 g ; 5.1 mEq/L [ 95 % CI , 5.0-5 .2 ] for placebo ; P < .001 for all comparisons ) .",3
"The proportion of patients with mean potassium < 5.1 mEq/L during days 8-29 was significantly higher in all zirconium cyclosilicate groups vs placebo ( 36/45 [ 80 % ] , 45/50 [ 90 % ] , and 51/54 [ 94 % ] for the 5-g , 10-g , and 15-g groups , vs 38/82 [ 46 % ] with placebo ; P < .001 for each dose vs placebo ) .",3
"Adverse events were comparable between zirconium cyclosilicate and placebo , although edema was more common in the 15-g group ( edema incidence : 2/85 [ 2 % ] , 1/45 [ 2 % ] , 3/51 [ 6 % ] , and 8/56 [ 14 % ] patients in the placebo , 5-g , 10-g , and 15-g groups ) .",3
"Hypokalemia developed in 5/51 ( 10 % ) and 6/56 patients ( 11 % ) in the 10-g and 15-g zirconium cyclosilicate groups , vs none in the 5-g or placebo groups .",3
"Among outpatients with hyperkalemia , open-label sodium zirconium cyclosilicate reduced serum potassium to normal levels within 48 hours ; compared with placebo , all 3 doses of zirconium cyclosilicate resulted in lower potassium levels and a higher proportion of patients with normal potassium levels for up to 28 days .",4
Further studies are needed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of zirconium cyclosilicate beyond 4 weeks and to assess long-term clinical outcomes .,4
"Participants in the video game group performed a median of 271 purposeful movements and 37 970 activity counts compared to 48 purposeful movements and 14,872 activity counts in the traditional group ( z = -3.0 , P = .001 and z = -1.9 , P = .05 , respectively ) .",3
"Participants in the traditional group performed a median of 26 nonpurposeful ( exercises ) compared with 0 in the video game group ( z = -4.2 , P = .000 ) .",3
"Strong significant correlations were found between the motor ability of the weak UE to repetitions of participants in both groups ( r = .86 , P < .01 ) .",3
Participants with higher motor ability performed more repetitions .,3
Video games elicited more UE purposeful repetitions and higher acceleration of movement compared with traditional therapy in individuals with chronic stroke .,4
"Mean improvement from baseline BCVA at week 24 was 15.5 and 15.8 letters in the 0.5-mg and 2.0-mg CRVO groups , and 12.1 and 14.6 letters in the 0.5-mg and 2.0-mg BRVO groups .",3
"For CRVO , but not BRVO , there was significantly greater reduction from baseline mean central subfield thickness ( CST ) in the 2.0-mg versus 0.5-mg group ( 396.1 vs. 253.5 m ; P = 0.03 ) .",3
"For the second randomization in CRVO patients , there was no significant difference from week 24 BCVA in the ranibizumab plus laser versus the ranibizumab only groups at week 48 ( -3.3 vs. 0.0 letters ) , week 96 ( +0.69 vs. -1.6 letters ) , or week 144 ( +0.4 vs. -6.7 letters ) , and a significant increase from week 24 mean CST at week 48 ( +94.7 vs. +15.2 m ; P = 0.05 ) but not weeks 96 or 144 .",3
"For BRVO , there was a significant reduction from week 24 mean BCVA in ranibizumab plus laser versus ranibizumab at week 48 ( -7.5 vs. +2.8 ; P < 0.01 ) and week 96 ( -2.0 vs. +4.8 ; P < 0.03 ) , but not week 144 , and there were no differences in mean CST change from week 24 at weeks 48 , 96 , or 144 .",3
Laser failed to increase edema resolution or to reduce the ranibizumab injections between weeks 24 and 144 .,3
"In patients with macular edema resulting from RVO , there was no short-term clinically significant benefit from monthly injections of 2.0-mg versus 0.5-mg ranibizumab injections and no long-term benefit in BCVA , resolution of edema , or number of ranibizumab injections obtained by addition of laser treatment to ranibizumab .",4
"Fifty-six girls were randomised to EE2 at 12 years ( n = 28 , 11 Ox ) or 14 years ( n = 28 , 13 Ox ) ; there were 19 girls in the late group ( 9 Ox ) and 17 girls with spontaneous puberty ( 10 Ox ) .",3
"Girls receiving EE2 at 12 versus 14 years had faster bone maturation , but neither group showed acceleration .",3
Ox increased HV without altering bone maturation or pubertal progression .,3
Girls with spontaneous puberty had greater pubertal growth ( mean PHV 8.5 cm/year ; p < 0.001 ) and height gain ( p < 0.001 ) than EE2-treated girls despite similar mean enrolment height SD and dysmorphology scores .,3
Pubertal induction with EE2 does not replicate the acceleration observed in unaffected girls or TS girls with spontaneous puberty .,4
"Over an average follow-up period of 6.8 years , 41 eyes ( 57.7 % ) showed progression in either structural or functional evaluation .",3
"Disc haemorrhage ( DH ) was observed significantly more frequently in the progressing group ( p < 0.005 ) ; however , there were no differences in mean age , gender ratio , follow-up period and ocular characteristics at baseline such as IOP , RNFL defects and global indices of VF between the non-progressing and progressing groups .",3
Thirty eyes ( 42.3 % ) showed significant angular widening of the localized RNFL defect towards the macula at a mean rate of approximately 1/year .,3
"Perimetric glaucoma developed in 19 eyes ( 26.8 % ) , and the rate of change in the mean deviation was -0.23 dB/year .",3
Preperimetric glaucoma patients with DH or IOP reductions of < 20 % from the baseline had a higher probability of RNFL deterioration than patients without DH or IOP reductions of 20 % from the baseline by multivariate analysis .,3
"Although the rates of change were typically slow , more than half of normotensive patients with PPG showed statistically significant progressive structural or functional changes in medically treated cases .",4
DH or IOP reductions of < 20 % from the baseline were shown as a significant risk factor for the progression of PPG .,4
"Patients ( n = 602 ; age , 6613 years ; 41 % female ; 51 % with systolic HF ) were randomized to 1 of 3 groups : control ( usual care ) , Fluid Watchers LITE , or Fluid Watchers PLUS .",3
Both intervention groups included a face-to-face education session delivered by a nurse focusing on self-care .,3
"The LITE group received 2 follow-up phone calls , whereas the PLUS group received biweekly calls ( mean , 5.33.6 ; range , 1-19 ) until the nurse judged the patient to be adequately trained .",3
"Over 2 years of follow-up , 35 % of patients ( n = 211 ) experienced cardiac death or hospitalization for HF , with no difference among the 3 groups in the proportion who experienced the combined clinical outcome ( P = 0.06 ) .",3
"Although patients in the LITE group had reduced cardiac mortality compared with patients in the control group over the 2 years of follow-up ( 7.5 % and 17.7 % , respectively ; P = 0.003 ) , there was no significant difference in cardiac mortality between patients in the PLUS group and the control group .",3
A face-to-face education intervention did not significantly decrease the combined end point of cardiac death or hospitalization for HF .,4
Increasing the number of contacts between the patient and nurse did not significantly improve outcome .,4
"In the exercise group , exercise capacity improved , as shown by the increase in the 6-min walk test from 365 ( 160-420 ) to 445 m ( 250-500 ) ( p = 0.01 ) , and in the 2-min step test ( p = 0.02 ) .",3
"Lower thigh circumference also increased , from 41 ( 34-53 ) to 46 cm ( 36-56 ) ( p = 0.02 ) , and the domains of SF-36 general health ( p = 0.03 ) , vitality ( p = 0.01 ) and social function ( p = 0.04 ) improved significantly .",3
"In the control group , no statistically significant changes were observed in any of the parameters .",3
We did not observe complications of cirrhosis in either group during the study .,3
"A programme of moderate physical exercise together with leucine supplements in patients with cirrhosis is safe and improves exercise capacity , leg muscle mass and HRQoL .",4
"All 933,789 people aged 40 years with diagnosed diabetes in Ontario , Canada were studied using population-level administrative databases , with additional clinical outcome data collected from a random sample of 1,592 high risk patients .",3
Family practices were randomly assigned to receive the educational toolkit in June 2009 ( intervention group ) or May 2010 ( control group ) .,3
"The primary outcome in the administrative data study , death or non-fatal myocardial infarction , occurred in 11,736 ( 2.5 % ) patients in the intervention group and 11,536 ( 2.5 % ) in the control group ( p = 0.77 ) .",3
"The primary outcome in the clinical data study , use of a statin , occurred in 700 ( 88.1 % ) patients in the intervention group and 725 ( 90.1 % ) in the control group ( p = 0.26 ) .",3
"Pre-specified secondary outcomes , including other clinical events , processes of care , and measures of risk factor control , were also not improved by the intervention .",3
A limitation is the high baseline rate of statin prescribing in this population .,3
The educational toolkit did not improve quality of care or cardiovascular outcomes in a population with diabetes .,4
"Despite being relatively easy and inexpensive to implement , printed educational materials were not effective .",4
"The study highlights the need for a rigorous and scientifically based approach to the development , dissemination , and evaluation of quality improvement interventions .",4
"In a prospective , double-blind , placebo-controlled , randomized study Lp-PLA2 , oxy-LDL , myeloperoxidase and interleukin-6 were determined at baseline , 3-5 days and 30 days during administration of omega-3 PUFA 1g/day ( n = 30 ) or placebo ( n = 24 ) .",3
"Treatment with omega-3 PUFA resulted in reduction of Lp-PLA2 mass by 10.7 % , activity by 9.3 ( p = 0.026 for both ) and oxy-LDL by 10.9 % ( p = 0.014 ) at 30 days , with no change in myeloperoxidase and interleukin-6 .",3
"Compared with placebo , patients receiving omega-3 PUFA had lower Lp-PLA2 mass by 9.42 % , activity by 9.2 ( p = 0.041 for both ) and oxy-LDL by 12.3 % ( p = 0.10 ) after one month , but not at 3-5 days .",3
There were no correlations between Lp-PLA2 and both myeloperoxidase and oxy-LDL throughout the study .,3
"The multivariate model showed that only treatment with omega-3 PUFA and baseline myeloperoxidase levels were independent predictors of Lp-PLA2 mass changes at one month ( R ( 2 ) = 0.37 , P = 0.005 ) .",3
Administration of omega-3 PUFA can decrease Lp-PLA2 in patients with stable angina undergoing PCI .,4
This novel effect may contribute to the benefits derived from omega-3 PUF .,4
"Patent IRA [ thrombolysis in myocardial infarction ( TIMI ) grade 2 or 3 ] was observed in 77 % of HTUPA-treated patients , compared to 76 % of rt-PA-treated patients ( P = 0.76 ) .",3
"TIMI grade 3 patency rates were 52 % and 44 % in the HTUPA and rt-PA groups , respectively ( P = 0.37 ) .",3
The total patency rate was 77 % ( 86/111 patients ) in the HTUPA group and 73 % ( 80/110 patients ) in the rt-PA group ( P = 0.41 ) .,3
"Adverse events were infrequent in both groups , and no significant differences were detected in mortality , re-occlusion rate , revascularization rate , adverse effects , clotting index , LVEF , or electrocardiogram between the two groups .",3
Intravenous HTUPA had a safe and efficacious profile as good as rt-PA in patients with AMI .,4
"The FEMME trial 's primary outcome is the quality of life women with symptomatic uterine fibroids experience two years after they have been treated with either UAE or myomectomy , as measured by the disease-specific Uterine Fibroid Symptom Quality-of-Life ( UFS-QoL ) questionnaire .",4
"The mean difference in sleep diary-derived sleep efficiency at 1-week posttreatment was -1.40 ( 95 % CI , -7.08 to 4.28 ) between the acupuncture and minimal acupuncture groups and was 3.10 ( 95 % CI , -3.64 to 9.84 ) between the acupuncture and placebo acupuncture groups .",3
A ( 2 ) test showed that acupuncture produced a significantly higher proportion of participants achieving sleep-onset latency 30 minutes than did minimal acupuncture at 1-week posttreatment ( P = .04 ) .,3
"However , there was no significant between-group difference in most of the other outcomes .",3
"Treatment blinding was successful , as a majority of participants did not know which treatment they had received .",3
"Acupuncture was well tolerated , but the efficacy was only mild and similar to that of minimal acupuncture and placebo acupuncture .",4
A high proportion of patients remained clinically significantly affected by insomnia after treatment .,4
The finding raises certain doubts about the value of acupuncture and underscores the difficulties in the treatment of residual insomnia in MDD .,4
"In both tasks , we found that gender moderated the effect of oxytocin , such that male participants in the oxytocin condition rated faces more negatively , compared with placebo .",3
"The opposite pattern of findings emerged for female participants : they rated faces more positively in the oxytocin condition , compared with placebo .",3
These findings contribute to a small but growing body of research demonstrating differential effects of oxytocin in men and women .,4
"At baseline ESS , mean ( SD ) was 6.1 ( 2.4 ) in the pro-AMP cream group and 5.3 ( 3 ) in the control group .",3
"In the pro-AMP group , in comparison with baseline , ESS was significantly reduced to 2.5 ( -59 % ) after 3 wks and to 1.0 ( -84 % ) at week 6 ( p = 0.0001 ) .",3
"In the control group , ESS was reduced to 3 ( -42 % ) at week 2 and to 2.6 ( -50 % ) at week 6 .",3
"At week 6 , ESS in pro-AMP cream was significantly lower than the control group ( 1.0 vs. 2.6 ; p = 0.001 ) .",3
Both products were well tolerated .,3
Pro-AMP cream has shown to be effective in the treatment of mild-to moderate chronic lesion of AE of the face .,4
Clinical efficacy was greater in comparison with an emollient cream .,4
Two ( 16.7 % ) patients out of 12 patients treated with neoadjuvant chemo-radiotherapy and 5 ( 38.5 % ) out of 13 in the surgery group survived after 36 months .,3
These rates were not significantly different with per protocol and intention-to-treat analysis .,3
"The median survival time of patients in group A and B were 13.4 and 21.6 months , respectively , again not significantly different .",3
Survival was significantly greater in patients with well differentiated adenocarcinoma in group B than in group A ( p < 0.004 ) .,3
According to this study we suggest surgery then chemoradiotherapy for patients with well differentiated gastric adenocarcinoma rather than other approaches .,4
Additional studies with greater sample size and accurate matching relying on cancer molecular behavior are recommended .,4
59 subjects were evaluable for pharmacokinetics .,3
"Test/reference ratios of the geometric least squares means ( LSM ) and 90 % confidence intervals ( CI ) for AUC0-t ( t up to 120 hours ) , AUC0 - , and Cmax for low C-form vs. ref C-form were 101 ( 94.8 , 107 ) , 101 ( 95.3 , 107 ) , and 98.7 ( 88.6 , 110 ) , respectively ; and for high C-form vs. ref C-form were 96.0 ( 92.1 , 100 ) , 96.5 ( 92.5 , 101 ) , and 90.6 ( 83.5 , 98.4 ) , respectively .",3
The incidence of treatment-emergent adverse events ( TEAE ) and treatment-related adverse events ( TRAE ) were comparable between all formulations ( TEAE range 20-24 % ; TRAE range 15-19 % ) .,3
One serious TRAE ( spontaneous abortion ) occurred in the low C-form group .,3
"For both comparisons , the 90 % CIs of the test/reference ratios were within the regulatory acceptance range ( 80-125 % ) , suggesting that both test formulations ( low Cform and high C-form ) were bioequivalent to the reference formulation for Cmax , AUC0-t , and AUC0 - .",4
"Between 1996 and 2004 , a total of 4004 patients underwent randomization .",3
The majority of patients ( 76.1 % ) underwent breast-conserving surgery .,3
"After mastectomy , 73.4 % of the patients in both groups underwent chest-wall irradiation .",3
Nearly all patients with node-positive disease ( 99.0 % ) and 66.3 % of patients with node-negative disease received adjuvant systemic treatment .,3
"At a median follow-up of 10.9 years , 811 patients had died .",3
"At 10 years , overall survival was 82.3 % in the nodal-irradiation group and 80.7 % in the control group ( hazard ratio for death with nodal irradiation , 0.87 ; 95 % confidence interval [ CI ] , 0.76 to 1.00 ; P = 0.06 ) .",3
"The rate of disease-free survival was 72.1 % in the nodal-irradiation group and 69.1 % in the control group ( hazard ratio for disease progression or death , 0.89 ; 95 % CI , 0.80 to 1.00 ; P = 0.04 ) , the rate of distant disease-free survival was 78.0 % versus 75.0 % ( hazard ratio , 0.86 ; 95 % CI , 0.76 to 0.98 ; P = 0.02 ) , and breast-cancer mortality was 12.5 % versus 14.4 % ( hazard ratio , 0.82 ; 95 % CI , 0.70 to 0.97 ; P = 0.02 ) .",3
Acute side effects of regional nodal irradiation were modest .,3
"In patients with early-stage breast cancer , irradiation of the regional nodes had a marginal effect on overall survival .",4
"Disease-free survival and distant disease-free survival were improved , and breast-cancer mortality was reduced .",4

"One thousand , one hundred sixty-eight AJ individuals were counseled , 1042 consented , 1034 were randomly assigned ( 691 women , 343 men ) , and 1017 were eligible for analysis .",3
Mean age was 54.3 ( SD = 14.66 ) years .,3
"Thirteen BRCA1/2 carriers were identified in the PS arm , nine in the FH arm .",3
Five more carriers were detected among FH-negative FH-arm participants following study completion .,3
"There were no statistically significant differences between the FH and PS arms at seven days or three months on measures of anxiety , depression , health anxiety , distress , uncertainty , and quality-of-life .",3
Contrast tests indicated that overall anxiety ( P = .0001 ) and uncertainty ( P = .005 ) associated with genetic testing decreased ; positive experience scores increased ( P = .0001 ) ; quality-of-life and health anxiety did not change with time .,3
"Overall , 56 % of carriers did not fulfill clinical criteria for genetic testing , and the BRCA1/2 prevalence was 2.45 % .",3
"Compared with FH-based testing , population-based genetic testing in Ashkenazi Jews does n't adversely affect short-term psychological/quality-of-life outcomes and may detect 56 % additional BRCA carriers .",4
"This large trial will add substantially to evidence on the effectiveness of nicotine preloading , but also on its cost effectiveness and potential mediators , which have not been investigated in detail previously .",4
"A range of recruitment strategies have been considered to try and compensate for any challenges encountered in recruiting the large sample , and the multicentre design means that knowledge can be shared between recruitment teams .",4
The pragmatic study design means that results will give a realistic estimate of the success of the intervention if it were to be rolled out as part of standard smoking cessation service practice .,4
"Compared with durable polymer SES , the noninferiority of SES with biodegradable polymer coating was established by an absolute risk difference of 0.9 % in the primary end-point ( 12.4 % vs. 13.3 % , P = 0.67 ) and an upper limit of one-sided 95 % confidence interval ( CI ) of 2.96 % ( P for noninferiority = 0.001 ) .",3
"Rate of death , recurrent MI , and TLR were 7.9 % and 8.6 % ( HR : 0.92 ; 95 % CI : 0.61-1 .38 , P = 0.67 ) , 2.9 % and 3.5 % ( HR : 0.80 ; 95 % CI : 0.42-1 .54 , P = 0.51 ) , and 2.0 % and 3.2 % ( HR : 0.62 ; 95 % CI : 0.30-1 .30 , P = 0.20 ) in the biodegradable polymer SES and durable polymer SES group at 1-year clinical follow-up , respectively .",3
"Despite similar rates of 30-day ARC definite/probable stent thrombosis , late stent thrombosis ( stent thrombosis occurring beyond 30 days ) was lower with biodegradable polymer SES ( 0.7 % vs. 2.2 % , P = 0.028 ) .",3
"In patients undergoing primary PCI for STEMI , the use of biodegradable polymer SES was associated with noninferior 1-year rates of MACE compared with durable polymer SES .",4
"The average error angle values of active and passive reposition tests of the injured ankle-joint were 4.98 + / - 1.11 and 4.78 + / - 1.3 before the treatment , and 3.67 + / - 0.58 and 3.51 + / - 0.64 after the treatment , respectively in the acupuncture group , being reduced significantly after the treatment ( both P < 0.01 ) .",3
No significant changes of the average error angle values of both active and passive reposition tests of the ankle-joint were found after the treatment in the physiotherapy group ( P > 0.05 ) .,3
"Comparison between two groups showed that the average error angle , average active and passive reposition angles of the injured ankle in the acupuncture group were evidently lower than those in the physiotherapy group ( P < 0.01 ) .",3
"Acupuncture and moxibustion can effectively improve the proprioception of the injured lateral collateral ligament of the ankle joint in athletes , which is superior to conventional physiotherapy in the therapeutic effect .",4
"There were measures within each domain , i.e. , comorbid psychological distress , IBS-related fear and avoidance behaviors , and IBS-related disability , with the exception of demographic data , that were correlated with the symptom levels at post-treatment and follow-up .",3
"However , when these were entered into a multiple regression analyses that controlled for pre-treatment levels , none remained a significant predictor of the post-treatment and follow-up symptomatic status .",3
The study did not find any individual characteristics that made patients more or less likely to respond to the exposure-based ICBT .,4
The finding that comorbid psychological distress did not predict outcome is in accordance with previous studies .,4
Reliable predictors for response to any type of psychological treatment for IBS remain to be established .,4
Demographic data were not different between the study and control groups .,3
Cycle characteristics were found to be homogeneous between groups .,3
A total of 38 pregnancies were achieved ( 15.5 % pregnancy rate per cycle ) .,3
"The clinical pregnancy rate and live birth rate per cycle in progesterone supported cycles were 18.9 % and 16.8 % , respectively .",3
There might be a clinical benefit of luteal progesterone supplementation on OI/IUI cycles for women with PCOS .,4
"Although we did not reach a statistically significant difference between the 2 groups , luteal-supported cycles demonstrated a 6.7 % higher clinical pregnancy rate and 6.1 % higher live birth rate .",4
"34 units from 11 nursing homes , including 318 residents and 376 nursing staff members participated in the cost analyses .",3
Analyses showed no difference in total costs .,3
However certain changes within costs could be noticed .,3
The intervention group showed lower costs associated with outpatient hospital appointments over time ( p = 0.05 ) than the control group .,3
"In both groups , the number of falls , costs associated with the elderly-care physician and nurse practitioner increased equally during the study ( p < 0.02 ) .",3
DCM is a cost-neutral intervention .,4
It effectively reduces outpatient hospital appointments compared to usual care .,4
"Other considerations than costs , such as nursing homes ' preferences , may determine whether they adopt the DCM method .",4
"Fifty patients completed the trial , and patients were well matched .",3
Isthmus ablation was successful in all patients ; pulmonary vein isolation was successful in 25 ( 100 % ) randomized patients .,3
Procedure ( P < .0001 ) and fluoroscopy ( P < .0001 ) times were longer in the combined ablation group .,3
More patients in the isthmus ablation-only group experienced new-onset AF during follow-up ( 52 % vs. 12 % ; P = .003 ) .,3
The 1-year AF burden also favored the combined ablation group compared with the isthmus ablation-only group ( 8.3 % vs. 4.0 % ; P = .034 ) .,3
"In the isthmus ablation-only group , 8 ( 32 % ) patients subsequently underwent another ablation for AF .",3
The performance of pulmonary vein isolation and male sex were independent predictors of freedom from AF .,3
"In the PREVENT-AF Study I randomized clinical trial of patients in whom only typical AFL had been observed clinically , the addition of pulmonary vein isolation to cavotricuspid isthmus ablation resulted in a marked reduction of new-onset AF during clinical follow-up as assessed with a continuous implantable cardiac monitor .",4
A total of 64 patients were enrolled ( 31 in the rFVIIa group and 33 in the control group ) .,3
"Treatment with rFVIIa was associated with a reduction in operation time , red blood cell and fresh froze plasma transfusion , blood loss and prothrombin time compared to the control group ( p < 0.05 for all ) .",3
Activated partial thromboplastin time and mortality were similar between the two groups ( P > 0.05 ) .,3
Treatment with rFVIIa significantly improved the extrinsic coagulation function in patients with severe acute pancreatitis and was associated with decreased risk of bleeding .,4
"However , rFVIIa did not improve intrinsic coagulation or reduce over-cause mortality .",4
In total 107 patients were enrolled : 50 in the informal and 57 in the formal group .,3
Most patients had positive answers to the customer survey .,3
"There were significant differences between formal and informal groups : recalling the oncoming and outgoing physician coming to the patient 's bed ( p = 0.000 ) , with more formal group recalling that than informal group patients ; the oncoming physician introducing him/herself ( p = 0.01 ) , with more from the formal group answering yes and the physician discussing tests and implications with formal group patients ( p = 0.02 ) .",3
"This study was done at an urban inner city ED , a fact that may have skewed its results .",4
A comparison of suburban and rural EDs would make the results stronger .,4
It also reflected a very high level of customer satisfaction within the ED .,4
This lack of variance may have meant that the correlation between customer service and handoffs was missed or underrepresented .,4
"There was no codified observation of either those using the IPASS the BATON script or those using informal procedures , so no comparison of level and types of information given between the two groups was done .",4
There could have been a bias of those attending who had internalized the IPASS the BATON procedures and used them even when they were assigned to the informal group .,4
A hand off from one physician to the next in the emergency department is best done using a formalized process .,4
IPASS the BATON is a useful tool for hand off in the ED in part because it involved the patient in the process .,4
The formal hand off increased communication between patient and doctor as its use increased the patient 's opportunity to ask and respond to questions .,4
The researchers evaluated an ED physician specific hand-off process and illustrate the value and impact of involving patients in the hand-off process .,4
"The rate of successful abortions was similar with the 24-hour and 48-hour dosing intervals ( 95.8 % and 93.6 % , respectively ; P = 0.38 ) .",3
The mean induction-to-abortion interval was also comparable between the 2 groups ( 8.64.1 hours versus 8.73.9 hours ; P = 0.37 ) .,3
Nulliparous women and women with a pregnancy duration of 16weeks or more had a longer induction-to-abortion interval in both groups .,3
The 24-hour dosing interval between misoprostol and mifepristone administration seems to be as effective as the 48-hour dosing interval for second trimester TOP .,4
Clinical Trial Registry India : CTRI/2011/05 / 001770 .,4
"Patients in the exercise intervention group had greater improvement of mean pulse wave velocity ( P < 0.001 ) , augmentation index ( P = 0.048 ) , and gait velocity ( 6-min walk test , P < 0.001 ; 10-m walk test , P < 0.001 ) than did patients in the control group .",3
"Patients in the exercise intervention group also had greater improvements in physical fitness component ( grip strength , P < 0.001 ; muscular strength of upper and lower limbs , P < 0.027 ; flexibility , P < 0.001 ) when compared with control patients .",3
The combined aerobic and resistance exercise program significantly reduced central arterial stiffness and increased gait velocity in patients with chronic poststroke hemiparesis .,4
"In patients with DED , baseline SNFL ( 17.065.78 mm/mm ( 2 ) ) was significantly lower than in controls ( 23.683.42 mm/mm ( 2 ) , P = 0.001 ) .",3
"In the artificial tear and loteprednol groups , although no significant improvement in any sign or symptom was noted in patients with low baseline SNFL ( < 16.84 mm/mm ( 2 ) ) , subjects with near-normal baseline SNFL ( 16.84 mm/mm ( 2 ) ) showed significant improvement in both symptoms and CFS score ( all P < 0.05 ) .",3
"In the loteprednol/tobramycin group , no significant change was evident for any sign or symptom in either subgroup of low or near-normal baseline SNFL .",3
Significant improvements in CFS and patient symptomatology after DED treatment were evident only in the subgroup with near-normal corneal SNFL .,4
Consideration of SNFL may assist in explaining the variability of patients ' response to DED therapy .,4
The total effective rate was 83.1 % ( 54/65 ) in the observation group and 87.7 % ( 57/65 ) in the control group .,3
The efficacy was similar between the two groups ( P > 0.05 ) .,3
"In the observation group , after treatment , 5-HT and GABA/Glu were all increased compared with those before treatment ( P < 0.05 , P < 0.01 ) and norepinephrine ( NE ) was reduced compared with that before treatment ( P < 0.05 ) .",3
The level of each index did not change significantly before and after treatment in the control group ( all P > 0.05 ) .,3
"The regulations of 5-HT , GABA/Glu in the observation group were superior to those in the control group ( all P < 0.05 ) .",3
The combined therapy of warm acupuncture and auricular point sticking method for warming yang and benefiting qi effectively improves brain neurotransmitters and essentially improves sleep quality of the patients with insomnia differentiated as yang deficiency pattern .,4
Forty-four participants returned for assessment an average of 4.8 times over 53months .,3
Mean TAED was significantly less in needle aponeurotomy triamcinolone injection patients at 6 months and between 13 and 24 months .,3
Sixty-two percent of NA group patients and 30 % of needle aponeurotomy triamcinolone injection patients returned for a second treatment on the same digit ( s ) ( retreatment ) .,3
This difference was not significant .,3
Mean time to retreatment and mean TAED immediately prior to retreatment did not differ significantly between groups .,3
Kaplan-Meier survival estimates demonstrated a significantly higher percentage of NA group patients expected to return for retreatment by 24 but not by 36 months .,3
"Younger age , more than one joint treated at the initial NA , and TAED severity throughout the follow-up period were associated with earlier retreatment .",3
Serial triamcinolone injections combined with NA was associated with lower TAED for up to 24 months .,4
A larger study would more accurately quantify the potential benefits of combining triamcinolone injections with NA for treatment of Dupuytren disease .,4
"The intervention had a significant effect on mean time for vigorous ( p = 0.008 ) , moderate ( p = 0.023 ) and total physical activity ( p = 0.001 ) when compared to the control group .",3
"The intervention group increased their vigorous activity by a mean of 24min/week , moderate activity by 23min/week and total physical activity by 72min/week .",3
A relatively minimum home based intervention was able to demonstrate modest but statistically significant improvements in physical activity in a hard to reach group .,4
These changes if maintained over a longer period are likely to improve the health of mothers and have a positive impact on their partners and children .,4

"The intention-to-treat FACT-P population included 938 patients ( enzalutamide , n = 674 ; placebo n = 264 ) with evaluable FACT-P assessments at baseline and 1 post-baseline assessment .",3
"After 25 weeks , the mean FACT-P total score decreased by 1.52 points with enzalutamide compared with 13.73 points with placebo ( P < 0.001 ) .",3
"In addition , significant treatment differences at week 25 favoring enzalutamide were evident for all FACT-P subscales and indices , whether analyzed by MMRM or PMM .",3
CDF plots revealed differences favoring enzalutamide compared with placebo across the full range of possible response levels for FACT-P total and all disease - and symptom-specific subscales/indices .,3
"In men with progressive mCRPC after docetaxel-based chemotherapy , enzalutamide is superior to placebo in health-related quality-of-life outcomes , regardless of analysis model or threshold selected for meaningful response .",4
"Enrollment was initiated in September 2012 , and until October 2013 91 patients were included .",3
The inclusion phase is expected to last until the second half of 2014 .,3

Oxytocin reduced caloric intake with a preferential effect on fat intake and increased levels of the anorexigenic hormone cholecystokinin without affecting appetite or other appetite-regulating hormones .,3
There was no effect of oxytocin on REE .,3
Oxytocin resulted in a shift from carbohydrate to fat utilization and improved insulin sensitivity .,3
Intranasal oxytocin reduces caloric intake and has beneficial metabolic effects in men without concerning side effects .,4
The efficacy and safety of sustained oxytocin administration in the treatment of obesity warrants investigation .,4
The average cost-effectiveness ratio ( ACER ) in patient 's perspective of baclofen and chlordiazepoxide was Rs .,3
"5,308.61 and Rs .",3
"2,951.95 per symptom-free day , respectively .",3
The ACER in third-party perspective of baclofen and chlordiazepoxide was Rs .,3
895.01 and Rs .,3
"476.29 per symptom-free day , respectively .",3
"Participants on chlordiazepoxide had more number of symptom-free days when compared with the baclofen group on analysis by Mann-Whitney test ( U = 253.50 , P = 0.03 ) .",3
Both study drugs provided relief of withdrawal symptoms .,4
Chlordiazepoxide was more cost-effective than baclofen .,4
Baclofen was relatively less effective and more expensive than chlordiazepoxide .,4
"Median Visual Analog Scale ( VAS ) score of group 1 was 4 ( high = 6 , low = 3 ) while for group 2 was 5.50 ( high = 8 , low = 4 ) and the p value was < 0.001 .",3
"Mean time for the demand of the first analgesic was prolonged from 1.191.05 h to 5.311.14 h with the p value of < 0.0005 , while the mean time of hospital stay was reduced from 22.53.30 h to 14.12.99 h with the p value of < 0.0005 .",3
"Preemptive analgesia with 0.75 % ropivacaine causes significant reduction in pain perception , request for an analgesic and hospital stay .",4

"Patients reported worse toxicity for all four BR23 breast symptoms at 6 months , which then improved over time ( p < 0.0001 ) .",3
"They also reported improvement in skin appearance and breast hardness over time ( p < 0.0001 ) , with no significant change for breast shrinkage ( p = 0.47 ) and overall breast appearance ( p = 0.13 ) .",3
"At 5years , PROMs assessments did not demonstrate a benefit for simple IMRT over standard radiotherapy .",3
"Large breast volume , young age , baseline surgical cosmesis and post-operative infection were the most important variables to affect PROMs .",3
This study was unable to demonstrate the benefits of IMRT on PROMs at 5years .,4
PROMs are influenced by non-radiotherapy factors and surgical factors should be optimised to improve patients ' outcome .,4
"Only a small proportion of patients report moderate-severe breast changes post radiotherapy , with most PROMs improving over time .",4
The difference in clinician assessment and PROMs outcome requires further investigation .,4
Forty patients ( 39 women ; mean age 59 years ) met the eligibility criteria ; 23 were randomized to receive SNS and 17 to PTNS .,3
Fifteen patients progressed to permanent SNS implantation and 16 received a full course of PTNS .,3
Within-group effect sizes were marginally greater for SNS than for PTNS on available-case analysis .,3
"Mean ( s.d. ) FI episodes per week at baseline , and 3 and 6 months of follow-up were : 114 ( 120 ) , 40 ( 40 ) and 49 ( 69 ) respectively for SNS compared with 106 ( 112 ) , 58 ( 69 ) and 63 ( 69 ) for PTNS .",3
"Mean ( s.d. ) Cleveland Clinic Incontinence Score values at baseline , and 3 and 6 months were : 162 ( 30 ) , 111 ( 52 ) and 104 ( 56 ) for SNS versus 151 ( 27 ) , 117 ( 44 ) and 121 ( 52 ) for PTNS .",3
Improvement of at least 50 per cent in FI episodes per week at 6 months was seen in 11 of 18 patients in the SNS group compared with seven of 15 in the PTNS group .,3
Effect estimates for SNS with chronic implanted stimulation were larger ( 10 of 15 patients at 6 months ) .,3
Disease-specific and generic quality-of-life improvements complemented clinical outcome data .,3
Qualitative analysis of interview data suggested that both treatments had high acceptability amongst patients .,3
"In the short term , both SNS and PTNS provide some clinical benefit to patients with FI .",4
Registration numbers : 2010-018728-15 and 10479 ( http://public.ukcrn.org.uk/search/StudyDetail.aspx?StudyID=10479 ) .,4
"Because of early study termination ( clinical hold ) by the US Food and Drug Administration , 77 ( intent-to-treat ) of the planned 200 patients were enrolled .",3
"The primary endpoint , the mean reduction of average daily pain at week 12 compared with baseline , showed a positive dose-response relationship ( p = 0.014 , 1-sided ) ; the pair-wise comparison between the 10-mg group and placebo was significant ( unadjusted p = 0.040 , 2-sided ) .",3
An exploratory responder analysis revealed that a greater proportion of patients in the 10-mg group reported 30 % reduction in the average DPNP intensity compared with placebo at week 12 ( p = 0.006 ) .,3
"Although not statistically significant , several secondary endpoints showed directionally similar results to the primary efficacy dose-response relationship .",3
"During the combined efficacy and safety extension phases , the top 3 treatment-emergent adverse events in the combined fulranumab group were arthralgia ( 11 % ) , edema peripheral ( 11 % ) , and diarrhea ( 9 % ) .",3
No cases of joint replacement or death were reported .,3
"Despite early study termination , fulranumab treatment resulted in dose-dependent efficacy and was generally well tolerated .",4
"919 patients were enrolled , of whom 461 were randomly assigned to the trebananib group and 458 to the placebo group .",3
"Median progression-free survival was significantly longer in the trebananib group than in the placebo group ( 72 months [ 58-74 ] vs 54 months [ 95 % CI 43-55 ] , respectively , hazard ratio 066 , 95 % CI 057-077 , p < 00001 ) .",3
Incidence of grade 3 or higher adverse events was similar between treatment groups ( 244 [ 54 % ] of 452 patients in the placebo group vs 258 [ 56 % ] of 461 patients in the trebananib group ) .,3
"Trebananib was associated with more adverse event-related treatment discontinuations than was placebo ( 77 [ 17 % ] patients vs 27 [ 6 % ] , respectively ) and higher incidences of oedema ( 294 [ 64 % ] patients had any-grade oedema in the trebananib group vs 127 [ 28 % ] patients in the placebo group ) .",3
"Grade 3 or higher adverse events included ascites ( 34 [ 8 % ] in the placebo group vs 52 [ 11 % ] in the trebananib group ) , neutropenia ( 40 [ 9 % ] vs 26 [ 6 % ] ) , and abdominal pain ( 21 [ 5 % ] vs 22 [ 5 % ] ) .",3
We recorded serious adverse events in 125 ( 28 % ) patients in the placebo group and 159 ( 34 % ) patients in the trebananib group .,3
"There was a difference of 2 % or less in class-specific adverse events associated with anti-VEGF therapy ( hypertension , proteinuria , wound-healing complications , thrombotic events , gastrointestinal perforations ) , except bleeding , which was more common in the placebo group than in the trebananib group ( 75 [ 17 % ] vs 46 [ 10 % ] ) .",3
Inhibition of angiopoietins 1 and 2 with trebananib provided a clinically meaningful prolongation in progression-free survival .,4
This non-VEGF anti-angiogenesis option for women with recurrent epithelial ovarian cancer should be investigated in other settings and in combination with additional agents .,4
"Although oedema was increased , typical anti-VEGF associated adverse events were not prominent .",4
"The mean binding potential of all five regions of interest ( total binding potential ) was significantly greater with bilastine than hydroxyzine ( mean value 0.26 vs. 0.13 , P < 0.01 ; mean difference and 95 % CI -0.130 [ -0.155 , 0.105 ] ) .",3
There was no significant difference between bilastine and placebo .,3
"Overall H1 RO by bilastine was significantly lower than that by hydroxyzine ( mean value -3.92 % vs. 53.95 % , P < 0.01 ; mean difference and 95 % CI 57.870 % [ 42.664 % , 73.075 % ] ) .",3
There was no significant linear relationship between individual bilastine plasma concentrations and total binding potential values .,3
No significant between-treatment differences were observed for sedation and psychomotor performance .,3
Twenty-six non-serious AEs were reported .,3
Sleepiness or sedation was not reported with bilastine but appeared in some subjects with hydroxyzine .,3
"A single oral dose of bilastine 20mg had minimal H1 RO , was not associated with subjective sedation or objective impairment of psychomotor performance and was devoid of treatment-related sedative AEs , thus satisfying relevant subjective , objective and PET criteria as a non-sedating antihistamine .",4
"513 of the 3,230 participants were identified as having type 2 diabetes and thus were included in the study .",3
"Telehealth was associated with lower HbA1c than usual care during the trial period ( difference 0.21 % or 2.3 mmol/mol , 95 % CI , 0.04 % to 0.38 % , p = 0.013 ) .",3
"Among the 457 patients in the secondary analysis , mean HbA1c showed little change for controls following recruitment , but fell for intervention patients from 8.38 % to 8.15 % ( 68 to 66 mmol/mol ) .",3
A higher proportion of intervention patients than controls had HbA1c below the 7.5 % ( 58 mmol/mol ) threshold that was targeted by general practices ( 30.4 % vs. 38.0 % ) .,3
"This difference , however , did not quite reach statistical significance ( adjusted odds ratio 1.63 , 95 % CI , 0.99 to 2.68 , p = 0.053 ) .",3
Telehealth modestly improved glycaemic control in patients with type 2 diabetes over 12 months .,4
"The scale of the improvements is consistent with previous meta-analyses , but was relatively modest and seems unlikely to produce significant patient benefit .",4
"Reductions in body weight ( CR , -5.3 0.8 kg ; CR + Ex , -5.1 0.7 kg ) , fat mass ( CR , -4.9 0.9 kg ; CR + Ex , -4.4 0.6 kg ) , and visceral fat ( CR , -24 5cm2 ; CR + Ex , -37 5cm2 ) were not statistically different between groups .",3
"Liver fat decreased significantly in both groups , with no difference between groups .",3
"Change in maximal oxygen uptake was significantly greater in the CR + Ex group than in the CR group ( CR , -0.7 0.7 mL/kg/min ; CR + Ex , 2.9 1.0 mL/kg/min ) .",3
"Both CR and CR + Ex resulted in an improved reduction in liver fat ; however , there was no additive effect of exercise training .",4
Fifty-five participants completed the study .,3
"The genotype order interaction was significant , F ( 1 , 47 ) = 8.42 , p = 0.006 , for DDD .",3
Three analyses of covariance were conducted for DDD during the week before each ASAE .,3
"Ondansetron compared to sertraline resulted in a significant reduction in DDD during the week before the first , F ( 1 , 47 ) = 7.64 , p = 0.008 , but not the third ASAE .",3
There was no difference in milliliters consumed during each ASAE .,3
This study modestly supports the hypothesis that ondansetron may reduce DDD in AD individuals with the LL genotype as measured naturalistically .,4
"By contrast , there was no support that ondansetron reduces drinking during the ASAEs or that sertraline reduces alcohol use in individuals who have SS/SL genotypes .",4
We provide limited support that ondansetron may reduce drinking in nontreatment-seeking individuals with the LL genotype .,4
"Acute kidney injury was significantly reduced with remote ischemic preconditioning ( 45 of 120 patients [ 37.5 % ] ) compared with control ( 63 of 120 patients [ 52.5 % ] ; absolute risk reduction , 15 % ; 95 % CI , 2.56 % -27.44 % ; P = .02 ) .",3
"Fewer patients receiving remote ischemic preconditioning received renal replacement therapy ( 7 [ 5.8 % ] vs 19 [ 15.8 % ] ; absolute risk reduction , 10 % ; 95 % CI , 2.25 % -17.75 % ; P = .01 ) , and remote ischemic preconditioning reduced intensive care unit stay ( 3 days [ interquartile range , 2-5 ] ) vs 4 days ( interquartile range , 2-7 ) ( P = .04 ) .",3
"There was no significant effect of remote ischemic preconditioning on myocardial infarction , stroke , or mortality .",3
"Remote ischemic preconditioning significantly attenuated the release of urinary insulinlike growth factor-binding protein 7 and tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases 2 after surgery ( remote ischemic preconditioning , 0.36 vs control , 0.97 ng/mL2/1000 ; difference , 0.61 ; 95 % CI , 0.27-0 .86 ; P < .001 ) .",3
No adverse events were reported with remote ischemic preconditioning .,3
"Among high-risk patients undergoing cardiac surgery , remote ischemic preconditioning compared with no ischemic preconditioning significantly reduced the rate of acute kidney injury and use of renal replacement therapy .",4
The observed reduction in the rate of acute kidney injury and the need for renal replacement warrants further investigation .,4
"The formative research suggested that RDTs were a potential source of conflict in the health worker-patient interaction , but that health workers used various techniques to resolve this , including provision of antimalarial drugs for RDT-negative patients .",3
Our reviews showed that evidence was mixed regarding the effectiveness of different methods and theories to support change in prescribing practice .,3
"Our design process is presented , drawing from this collective evidence .",3
"We describe the final TACT intervention package ( including interactive small group workshops , feedback text messages , motivational text messages and patient information leaflets and posters ) in terms of its programme theory and implementation theory .",3
Our study suggests that evidence-based design of complex interventions is possible .,4
The use of formative research to understand malaria overdiagnosis in context was central to the design of the intervention as well as empirical research to test materials and methods prior to implementation .,4
The TACT interventions may be appropriate for other settings where clinicians face similar challenges with malaria diagnostics .,4
Participants were 66 mothers who were the parents of children recruited from primary schools located in socioeconomically disadvantaged suburbs .,3
Intervention group participants viewed a slideshow focussed on healthy snack food affordability that illustrated cheaper healthier alternatives to common snack foods as well as food budgeting tips and price comparison education .,3
A mixed between-within ANCOVA was conducted to examine group differences in perceived affordability of healthy food across three time points .,3
"Results revealed no difference in perceived affordability of healthy food between the two groups at baseline whereas at post-intervention and follow-up , mothers in the intervention group perceived healthy food as more affordable than the control group .",3
Focussing on education-based interventions to improve perceptions of healthy food affordability may be a promising approach that complements existing nutrition promotion strategies .,4
No significant differences between the SSG and the Skin Stretch group were found for scar surface area .,3
"In the Skin Stretch group , a significant reduction of the surface area from 65.4 cm ( 2 ) ( 13.6-129 .1 ) to 13.4 cm ( 2 ) ( 3.0-36 .6 ) was found at 3 months ( p = 0.028 ) and at 12 months postoperatively ( 65.4 cm ( 2 ) ( 13.6-129 .1 ) to 33.0 cm ( 2 ) ( 8.9-63 .7 ) , p = 0.046 , Wilcoxon signed ranks test ) .",3
Skin Stretch for primary closure of acute burn wounds is a suitable technique and can be considered for specific circumscript full-thickness burn wounds .,4
"However , future research should be performed to provide additional scientific evidence .",4
The overall Boston Bowel Preparation Score between Kleanprep and Picoprep was not significantly different ( P = 0.182 ) .,3
"On reviewing segment scores , there were also no significant differences between Kleanprep and Picoprep .",3
Patients using Picoprep scored significantly better on the aspects of convenience and flavour of the preparation agent compared with patients using Kleanprep ( P < 0.001 ) .,3
"Side effects such as nausea ( P = 0.011 ) , vomiting ( P = 0.001 ) , headache ( P = 0.003 ) and bloating ( P < 0.001 ) were experienced less significantly by patients using Picoprep .",3
The present study did not find a difference in the effectiveness of bowel cleansing between Kleanprep and Picoprep .,4
Both were found to be adequate cleansing agents .,4
Picoprep was significantly better tolerated than Kleanprep .,4
"Therefore , we recommend Picoprep as a first-choice regimen for bowel preparation before colonoscopy .",4
"Whereas the restructuring intervention group and the control intervention group reported both increases in positive and decreases in negative affect from pre - to post-intervention , the three groups differed significantly on ERP measures .",3
Findings provide support for current models of mechanisms of action in cognitive therapies .,4
"No significant difference existed between two groups regarding age , gender , pure tone average , pretreatment tinnitus intensity , tinnitus duration or hearing loss level tinnitus duration ( P = 0.316,0.685,0.839,0.682 and 0.881 respectively ) .",3
"No significant post-treatment changes in the tinnitus severity index ( experimental group = 52 % , control group = 44 % ) were observed in either group ( P = 0.724 ) .",3
The most frequently encountered side effect was pain during injection .,3
The postaurical subcutaneous injection of triamcinolone acetonide has no obvious benefit compared with placebo for subjective tinnitus of cochlear origin refractory to medical treatment .,4
"Protocol variation rates were lower than reported in previous studies , and showed little correlation with GI toxicity outcomes .",3
Variations classified as ` major ' showed a non-significant trend for increased toxicity relative to those classified as ` minor ' .,3
"Results from a Level III phantom-based dosimetry study showed some correlation with GI toxicity , whereas ranking on a set-up accuracy study did not impact on toxicity .",3
"Toxicity in general increased with the number of participants accrued per centre , at odds with previous reports relating to disease progression , with a potential link to increases in low-mid-range rectal doses in the cohort from higher-accruing centres .",3
No QA-related variables correlated with GU toxicities .,3
"Besides non-significant trends , minimal association was observed between QA variables and toxicity rates for the RADAR trial .",4
The intention of the trial 's QA programme was to reduce treatment variations and minimise toxicity in the context of a relevantly advanced treatment approach .,4
"Nephrotoxicity , defined as an increase in serum creatinine of 0.5 mg/dl or 50 % above baseline ( whichever was larger ) , occurred in 17 ( 13.6 % ) of 125 patients .",3
No patients with VAN progressed to Loss or End stage as defined by the RIFLE criteria .,3
The incidence rate of VAN was 0.02 cases/day of vancomycin treatment .,3
"Nephrotoxicity developed at a median of 4.5 days ( interquartile range [ IQR ] 2.2-4 .9 ) peaked at 5.7 days ( IQR : 3.8-9 .6 ) , and resolved in 70.6 % of the cases within 16.5 days ( IQR : 6.0-17 .8 ) after onset .",3
"On multivariable logistic regression analysis , after controlling for hypotensive episodes , Charlson Comorbidity Index , and baseline creatinine clearance , concomitant use of piperacillin-tazobactam was associated with increased VAN ( adjusted odds ratio 5.36 , 95 % confidence interval 1.41-20 .5 ) .",3
"Vancomycin-associated nephrotoxicity is prevalent among internal medicine patients , with 5.36-fold higher odds if piperacillin-tazobactam is concomitantly administered .",4
"Pertuzumab consistently showed a PFS benefit , independent of biomarker subgroups ( hazard ratio < 1.0 ) , including estrogen receptor-negative and - positive subgroups .",3
"High HER2 protein , high HER2 and HER3 mRNA levels , wild-type PIK3CA , and low sHER2 showed a significantly better prognosis ( P < .05 ) .",3
"PIK3CA showed the greatest prognostic effect , with longer median PFS for patients whose tumors expressed wild-type versus mutated PIK3CA in both the control ( 13.8 v 8.6 months ) and pertuzumab groups ( 21.8 v 12.5 months ) .",3
"Through comprehensive prospective analyses , CLEOPATRA biomarker data demonstrate that HER2 is the only marker suited for patient selection for the trastuzumab plus pertuzumab-based regimen in HER2-positive metastatic breast cancer .",4

"Molecular analyses revealed that breast muscle from chickens consuming the HyD-42 expressed significantly higher concentrations of vitamin D receptor ( VDR ) , phospho mechanistic target of rapamycin ( Ser2481 ) , phospho ribosomal P70 S6 kinase ( RPS6K ) ( Thr421/Ser424 ) , and antigen Ki-67 ( Ki67 ) compared with the other groups .",3
"In line with the in vivo data , in vitro functional studies showed that cells treated with 25 ( OH ) D for 24 h had increased VDR expression , and activated the mechanistic target of rapamycin ( mTOR ) / S6 kinase ( S6K ) pathway , enhanced Ki67 protein concentrations , and induced QM7 cell proliferation compared with untreated or cholecalciferol-treated cells .",3
Blocking the mTOR pathway with rapamycin reversed these effects .,3
"Taken together , our findings provide evidence that the effects of 25 ( OH ) D on male broiler breast muscle are likely mediated through the mTOR-S6K pathway .",4

The score of VAS value of needle remaining for 20 min and 30 min of the control group was with significant difference ( P < 0.01 ) .,3
Comparison of the VAS scores before the treatment and the scores of the 2nd menstrual cycle were found with significant difference ( P < 0.01 ) .,3
"The VAS score of 2nd menstrual cycle was ( 28.73 + / - 16.15 ) in the observation group , which was better than ( 46.93 + / -12.18 ) in the control group ( P < 0.001 ) .",3
Comparison of the VAS score of the two groups at 5 min r emaining of the needle was without statistic significance between two groups ( P > 0.05 ) .,3
"However , the VAS impairment magnitude difference at that moment was with statistic significance ( P < 0.01 ) .",3
"From the time of needle remaining for 10 min , 20 min , 30 min until 120 min after needling , the differences of the VAS scores and impairment range were all with statistic significance ( all P < 0.01 ) .",3
The effects of the two acupuncture techniques could both be maintained up to 2 hours after needling .,3
Both methods of acupuncture have immediate and long-term analgesic effect in a certain degree on primary dysmenorrhea .,4
"However , compared with the control group , the advantage of analgesic effect in the observation group is significantly superior .",4
20 min needling remaining can reach the best analgesic effect .,4
A framework and process involving external and internal practice facilitation using the new role of PP was thought to impact CDPS .,3
The PP facilitated CDPS through on-going relationships with patients and practice team members .,3
"Key components included : 1 ) approaching CDPS in a comprehensive manner , 2 ) an individualized and personalized approach at multiple levels , 3 ) integrated continuity that included linking the patients and practices to CPDS resources , and 4 ) adaptability to different practices and settings .",3
"The BETTER framework and key components are described as impacting CDPS through a process that involved a new role , the PP .",4
The introduction of a novel role of a clinician within the primary care practice with skills in CDPS could appropriately address gaps in prevention and screening .,4
"After the treatment , of the 42 and 43 cases in the control and treatment groups , 9 ( 21.43 % ) and 20 ( 46.51 % ) were cured , 12 ( 28.57 % ) and 14 ( 32.56 % ) had a marked improvement , 13 ( 30.95 % ) and 7 ( 16.28 % ) were effective , 8 ( 19.05 % ) and 2 ( 4.65 % ) invalid , with the effective rates being 80.95 % and 95.35 % , respectively .",3

"Treatment response was observed in 90.7 % patients from methylphenidate group and 86.2 % patients of atomoxetine group at an average dose of 0.45 mg/kg/d and 0.61 mg/kg/d , respectively .",3
"The patients showed comparable improvement on VADPRS ( P = 0.500 ) , VADTRS ( P = 0.264 ) and CGI-S ( P = 0.997 ) .",3
"Weight loss was significantly higher in methylphenidate group ( -0.570.78 kg ; P = 0.001 ) , and heart rate increase was observed at higher rate in atomoxetine group ( 7 9 bpm ; P = 0.021 ) .",3
Methylphenidate and atomoxetine are efficacious in Indian children with ADHD at lesser doses than previously used .,4
Their efficacy and tolerability are comparable .,4
TRIAL REGISTRATION NO. : CTRI/2011/08 / 001981 .,4
"No genetic material of poliovirus was detected in any infant , while in 9 of them ( 18 % ) non polio EV was identified .",3
Real time PCR for EV did not amplify poliovirus from OPV samples .,3
Results suggest that no post VPO viraemia detectable by molecular methods exists .,4
"Considering that real time PCR for EV does not allow to identify polio virus , no false positives of the test are expected as a result of a recent VPO vaccination .",4
We documented presence of non polio EV in blood of healthy asymptomatic infants .,4
"The proposed study will provide information on costs and effects of Prism ; how it is used in practice , barriers and facilitators to its implementation ; and its perceived value in supporting the management of patients with and at risk of developing chronic conditions .",4
A five-trajectory model was chosen to best represent the data .,3
"For Physical-Social Functioning ( PSF ) , trajectory groups included Low Maintainer ( 8.3 % ) , Mid-Low Improver ( 10.4 % ) , Medium Decliner ( 10.7 % ) , Mid-High Maintainer ( 31.2 % ) , and High Maintainer ( 39.4 % ) ; for EF , trajectories included Low Maintainer ( 3 % ) , Mid-Low Improver ( 9 % ) , Medium Decliner ( 7.7 % ) , Mid-High Maintainer ( 22.8 % ) , and High Maintainer ( 57.5 % ) .",3
Cross-classification of the groups of trajectories demonstrated that the impact of a high and stable EF on PSF might be greater than the reverse .,3
"Low depression symptoms , low pain , and high social support were the most consistent predictors of high EF trajectories .",3
Aging women are heterogeneous in terms of positive aging indicators for up to 9 years of follow-up .,4
Interventions aimed at promoting sustainable EF might have diffused effects on other domains of healthy aging .,4
"The total effective rate was 85.43 % in the treatment group , higher than that of the control group ( 79.17 % , P < 0.05 ) .",3
"Besides , better effect in improving Chinese medical symptoms was obtained in the treatment group ( P < 0.05 ) .",3
POF patients ' serum hormone levels and clinical symptoms could be improved by WSEYIQNBM combined artificial cycle therapy .,4
"There was no difference in Dex-total between current intensities ( P = .99 ) , but a greater amount of Dex-total was recovered superficially at 1 mm compared to the 4-mm depth ( P < .0001 ) .",3
"Peak concentration mean SD values for the 1 - and 2-mA currents at 1 mm were 10.8 8.1 and 7.7 5.5 g/mL , and at 4 mm were 2.0 0.8 and 1.3 0.9 g/mL , respectively .",3
"Peak skin perfusion was 741.4 % 408.7 % and 711.6 % 260.8 % at baseline for 1 - and 2-mA intensities , respectively .",3
"Skin perfusion returned to baseline levels earlier during 1-mA intensity at a 110 mA min dose within the treatment , compared to 2 mA at 60 minutes posttreatment .",3
Transdermal delivery of Dex-P during iontophoresis was successfully measured in vivo through human skin .,4
Measurable concentrations of Dex-total were found regardless of current intensity .,4
"Although current-induced vasodilation occurred , it did not significantly affect the tissue accumulation of Dex-total .",4
"To our knowledge , this is the first study to investigate the effectiveness of smartphone-supplemented iCBT for anxiety disorders .",4
"Hence , the findings from this trial will constitute great advancements in the burgeoning and promising field of smartphone-administered psychological interventions .",4
Limitations are discussed .,4
Results of the study showed that dyads who received music therapy intervention significantly improved their nonverbal communication and mutual attunement .,3
"Similarly , parents who participated in dyadic music therapy reported themselves to be significantly less stressed by the mood of the child and to significantly improve their parent-child relationship in terms of being better at talking to and understanding their children than parents who did not receive music therapy .",3
"Both groups significantly improved in terms of increased positive and decreased negative emotional parental response , parenting stress and stress in general .",3
"There were no significant between group differences in self-perceived autonomy , attachment , and parental competence .",3
The dyadic music therapy intervention examined in this study improved emotional communication between parent and child and interaction after 6 to 10 sessions and can be considered as a viable treatment alternative or supplement for families at risk and families with emotionally neglected children .,4
We studied the relation between AF symptom severity [ quantified with the Toronto AF Severity Scale ( AFSS ) ] and cardiovascular outcome in patients included in the RACE II study .,3
The primary endpoint was a composite of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality .,3
Secondary outcome was cardiovascular hospitalizations .,3
"Of 614 permanent AF patients in RACE II , AFSS questionnaires were available in 558 patients ( 91 % ) .",3
Mean age was 68 8 years .,3
"One hundred and seventy-four patients ( 31 % ) reported a low score ( score 0-3 ; lowest tertile ) , 190 patients ( 34 % ) reported a moderate score ( score 4-9 ; middle tertile ) , and 194 ( 35 % ) reported a high score ( score 10-35 ; highest tertile ) .",3
"Patients with the most severe symptoms were more often women , had higher N-terminal prohormone of brain natriuretic peptide concentrations , and had more previous heart failure hospitalizations .",3
Median follow-up was 3.0 ( interquartile range 2.3-3 .0 ) years .,3
"The primary endpoint occurred most frequently in the highest tertile of the AFSS [ 16 ( 9 % ) , 19 ( 10 % ) , 36 ( 19 % ) , respectively , P = 0.01 ] , being mainly driven by heart failure hospitalizations [ 4 ( 2 % ) , 1 ( 1 % ) , 16 ( 8 % ) , respectively , P < 0.001 ] .",3
"After multivariable adjustment , higher AFSS scores were associated with the primary endpoint [ hazard ratio 1.38 ( 1.15-1 .66 ) , P = 0.001 ] , as well as with cardiovascular hospitalizations [ hazard ratio 1.33 ( 1.14-1 .54 ) , P < 0.001 ] .",3
"In permanent AF , after multivariable adjustment , symptom severity is associated with cardiovascular outcome .",4
"Statistically significant improvements in trough FEV1 at Day 169 ( 0.112 L , 95 % confidence interval [ CI ] : 0.081 , 0.144 ; p < 0.001 ) and weighted mean FEV1 over 06 h post-dose at Day 168 ( 0.105 L , 95 % CI : 0.071 , 0.140 ; p < 0.001 ) were observed for UMEC/VI versus TIO .",3
"In addition UMEC/VI improved health-related quality of life , and reduced requirement for the use of rescue medication compared with TIO .",3
The incidence of adverse events was similar between treatment groups .,3
UMEC/VI was associated with statistically significant and clinically meaningful improvements in lung function versus TIO .,4
UMEC/VI was well tolerated .,4
UMEC/VI 62.5 / 25 mcg could provide an effective new treatment option for patients with moderate-to-very severe COPD .,4
"Other than significantly higher fasting glucose concentrations for high vs. moderate protein intakes with a low-fat diet ( difference SE : 0.47 0.14 mmol/L ; P = 0.001 ) , there were no significant effects of dietary protein or SF on glucose metabolism , plasma insulin , or concentrations of lipids and lipoproteins .",3
"Changes in plasma BCAAs across all diets were negatively correlated with changes in the metabolic clearance rate of insulin ( = -0.18 , P = 0.03 ) and positively correlated with changes in the acute insulin response to glucose ( = 0.15 , P = 0.05 ) .",3
These findings suggest that short-term intake of BCAAs can influence insulin dynamics .,4
"However , in this group of overweight and obese individuals , neither high protein nor SF intake affected insulin sensitivity or plasma concentrations of lipids and lipoproteins .",4
This trial was registered at clinicaltrials.gov as NCT00508937 .,4
Primary efficacy endpoint was trough forced expiratory volume in one second ( FEV1 ) on Day 169 ( 23-24 h post-dose ) .,3
"Additional lung-function , symptomatic and health-related quality of life endpoints were also assessed .",3
"Safety evaluations included : adverse events , vital signs , electrocardiography and clinical laboratory measurements .",3
"All active treatments significantly improved trough FEV1 vs placebo ( 0.124-0 .238 L , all p < 0.001 ) .",3
Improvements with UMEC/VI 125/25 mcg were significantly greater than for UMEC 125 mcg or VI 25 mcg ( 0.079 L and 0.114 L ; both p0 .001 ) .,3
"Improvements for UMEC/VI 125/25 mcg vs placebo were observed for the transition dyspnea index ( 1.0 unit ; p < 0.001 ) , rescue albuterol use at Weeks 1-24 ( -1.5 puffs/day ) and St. George 's Respiratory Questionnaire ( -3.60 units , p < 0.001 ) .",3
No safety signals were observed .,3
"Once-daily UMEC/VI 125/25 mcg was well tolerated and provided greater improvements in lung function , health status , and dyspnea scores compared with monotherapy components and placebo over 24 weeks .",4
This study supports the use of UMEC/VI 125/25 mcg for the maintenance treatment of COPD .,4
"In all , 42 subjects completed the study .",3
The set-back suture provided statistically significant wound eversion .,3
"On the Likert scale , observers rated the set-back suture side 1 point better than the BVMSside .",3
"Both patient and observer total Patient and Observer Scar Assessment Scale scores were significantly lower for the set-back suture side ( subject mean 13.0 8.7 vs 16.2 12.0 [ P = .039 ] ; observer mean 24.5 10.4 vs 27.7 13.6 [ P = .028 ] , respectively ) .",3
Single institution experience and relatively short follow-up are limitations .,4
The set-back suture provides superior wound eversion and better cosmetic outcomes than the BVMS .,4
The concentration-time profile of macitentan was characterized by slow absorption ( median time to maximum plasma concentration [ t ( max ) ] 9-10 h ) and slow elimination ( mean elimination half-life [ t ] 11-15 h ) .,3
"After repeated doses of 3 , 10 , and 30 mg of macitentan over the course of 10 days , the peak concentration ( C ( max ) ) increased as the dose increased and the area under the plasma concentration-time curve during the dosing interval ( AUC ( ) ) increased in a dose-proportional manner .",3
Plasma concentrations showed approximately 1.5 - to 1.9-fold accumulation on day 10 compared with day 1 .,3
"ACT-132577 showed higher levels of exposure than macitentan , its mean half-life was 46-48 h , and it accumulated 7 - to 12-fold .",3
Macitentan increased plasma ET-1 concentrations at all doses tested and was well tolerated and elicited no serious adverse events .,3
"Multiple oral doses of 3 , 10 , and 30 mg of macitentan were well tolerated in healthy Korean subjects , and its pharmacokinetics correlated positively with ET-1 concentrations .",4
Frequencies of gE-specific CD4 ( + ) T cells were > 3-fold higher after two doses of all gE/AS01B formulations than after one dose of 100ggE/AS01B or two doses of 100ggE/saline .,3
"Frequencies were comparable after two doses of 25 , 50 , or 100ggE/AS01B .",3
Serum anti-gE antibody concentrations were comparable after two doses of 50 or 100ggE/AS01B and higher than in the other groups .,3
Immune responses persisted for at least 36 months .,3
Reactogenicities of all gE/AS01B formulations were similar but greater than with gE/saline .,3
The three formulations of gE/AS01B were immunogenic and well tolerated in adults aged 60years .,4
Two vaccinations with gE/AS01B induced higher immune responses than one and the dose of gE impacted humoral but not cellular immune responses ( NCT00434577 ) .,4
It is expected that the extended implementation strategy will reduce the number of patients referred to secondary care .,4
"It is hypothesised that the additional upfront cost of extended implementation will be counterbalanced by improvements in clinical practice and patient-related outcomes , thereby rendering the extended implementation strategy cost-effective .",4
MI patients had 18 % higher plasma levels of MAp44 ( IQR 11-25 % ) as compared to the healthy control group ( p < 0.001 .,3
"However , neither salvage index ( Spearman rho -0.1 , p = 0.28 ) nor final infarct size ( Spearman rho 0.02 , p = 0.83 ) correlated with plasma levels of MAp44 .",3
"Likewise , MASP-1 and MASP-3 were elevated in MI patients ( p = 0.002 and p < 0.001 ) , but the levels were not correlated to outcome .",3
"Plasma levels of MAp44 , MASP-1 , and MASP-3 are significantly higher in patients with MI compared to healthy control persons , but are not associated with short-term outcome measured as salvage index and final infarct .",4
"Between Nov 7 , 2005 , and Dec 20 , 2010 , 178 patients were randomly assigned to receive short-term androgen deprivation and 177 to receive long-term androgen deprivation .",3
"After a median follow-up of 63 months ( IQR 50-82 ) , 5-year biochemical disease-free survival was significantly better among patients receiving long-term androgen deprivation than among those receiving short-term treatment ( 90 % [ 95 % CI 87-92 ] vs 81 % [ 78-85 ] ; hazard ratio [ HR ] 188 [ 95 % CI 112-315 ] ; p = 001 ) .",3
5-year overall survival ( 95 % [ 95 % CI 93-97 ] vs 86 % [ 83-89 ] ; HR 248 [ 95 % CI 131-468 ] ; p = 0009 ) and 5-year metastasis-free survival ( 94 % [ 95 % CI 92-96 ] vs 83 % [ 80-86 ] ; HR 231 [ 95 % CI 123-385 ] ; p = 001 ) were also significantly better in the long-term androgen deprivation group than in the short-term androgen deprivation group .,3
"The effect of long-term androgen deprivation on biochemical disease-free survival , metastasis-free survival , and overall survival was more evident in patients with high-risk disease than in those with low-risk disease .",3
Grade 3 late rectal toxicity was noted in three ( 2 % ) of 177 patients in the long-term androgen deprivation group and two ( 1 % ) of 178 in the short-term androgen deprivation group ; grade 3-4 late urinary toxicity was noted in five ( 3 % ) patients in each group .,3
No deaths related to treatment were reported .,3
"Compared with short-term androgen deprivation , 2 years of adjuvant androgen deprivation combined with high-dose radiotherapy improved biochemical control and overall survival in patients with prostate cancer , particularly those with high-risk disease , with no increase in late radiation toxicity .",4
Longer follow-up is needed to determine whether men with intermediate-risk disease benefit from more than 4 months of androgen deprivation .,4
Nineteen athletes completed the study .,3
"After 3 weeks , the group receiving HVLA manipulation ( n = 11 ) had a statistically significant mean ( SD ) improvement in vertical jump height of 1.07 ( 1.23 ) cm ( P = .017 ) .",3
The sham treatment group ( n = 8 ) improved their vertical jump height by 0.59 ( 2.03 ) cm ( P = .436 ) .,3
"The between groups ' change was 0.47 cm ( 95 % confidence interval , -1.31 to 2.26 ; P = .571 ) in favor of the group receiving HVLA manipulation .",3
"Blinding and sham procedures were feasible , and there were no reported adverse events .",3
The results of this pilot study show that a larger-scale study is feasible .,4
Preliminary results suggest that chiropractic HVLA manipulation may increase vertical jump height in young female athletes with talocrural joint dysfunction .,4
"However , the clinical result in favor of HVLA manipulation compared with sham treatment needs statistical confirmation in a larger randomized clinical trial .",4
"The median/interquartile range of time was 39.5 / 41.7 seconds versus 18.6 / 10.0 seconds ( P < 0.001 ) and number of redirections was 3/3 .5 versus 1/0 ( P < 0.001 ) for the conventional and novel ultrasound devices , respectively .",3
"During vascular access in a vascular phantom model , the novel device decreased the time and the number of redirections significantly .",4
The device successfully improved the efficiency of the ultrasound-guided vascular access technique .,4
Cytokine measurements were available from 390 children .,3
The mortality rate ( MR ) was high ( 6.8 / 100 person-years-observation ( PYO ) ) .,3
Both low and high cytokine responses to LPS and PHA were associated with high mortality ( MR up to 25/100 PYO in the lowest 10 % and 9.2 / 100 PYO in the highest 10 % ) .,3
"In BCG-vaccinated children , higher IFN - responses to PPD were associated with better survival ( MR ratio = 0.43 ( 0.24-0 .77 ) ) .",3
Data presented a rare opportunity to explore associations between cytokine responses and mortality .,4
Both low and high cytokine responses were associated with high mortality ; a balanced response to invading pathogens seems preferable .,4
"Of 862 patients , 490 ( 56.8 % ) had one or more hospitalizations postenrollment : 257 ( 52.4 % ) PAH related , 214 ( 43.7 % ) PAH unrelated , and 19 ( 3.9 % ) of undetermined causes .",3
The most common causes of PAH-related hospitalization were congestive heart failure and placement/removal of a central venous catheter .,3
"Patients with PAH-related hospitalizations were more likely to receive parenteral therapy , be in functional class III/IV , and have higher risk scores before hospitalization at enrollment .",3
"Following discharge , 25.4 % 3.2 % and 31.0 % 4.0 % of patients with PAH-related and PAH-unrelated first hospitalization , respectively , remained hospitalization-free for 3 years ( P = .11 ) .",3
"Survival estimates at 3 years postdischarge were 56.8 % 3.5 % and 67.8 % 3.6 % ( P = .037 ) for patients with PAH-related and PAH-unrelated hospitalization , respectively .",3
"In the REVEAL Registry , PAH-related hospitalization was associated with relatively more rehospitalizations and worse survival at 3 years .",4
The results indicate that application of tranexamic acid gel is very effective for consistency and maintenance in the place of action and shows its efficacy as a procoagulant material .,3
The application of a gel solution of tranexamic acid in oral anticoagulants patients ameliorates healing time and the bleeding time within the first 48-72 h.,4
"Overall , 112 patients completed the study .",3
"Study participants were asked to complete the Inflammatory Bowel Disease Questionnaire and Simple Clinical Colitis Activity Index together with the Food Frequency Questionnaire at 0 , 6 and 24 weeks .",3
"At 24 weeks , there was a mean reduction in the Simple Clinical Colitis Activity Index score in the intervention group compared with an increase in the score in the control group [ -1.304 ( P = 0.0108 ) vs. 0.875 ( P = 0.0249 ) ] .",3
There was a mean increase in the Inflammatory Bowel Disease Questionnaire score in the intervention group compared with a reduction in the score in the control group [ 7.17 ( P = 0.126 ) vs. -3.44 ( P = 0.205 ) ] .,3
A total of 69 % of patients in the intervention group found the dietary advice significantly or moderately helpful .,3
The study suggests that there is likely to be a link between the dietary advice provided and symptomatic improvement .,4
"The effect of diet may not occur through the addition or the elimination of single nutrients ; rather , each food consumed combines many nutrients that allow for a synergistic or an antagonistic action when present in a certain composition .",4
"In total , 260 patients were randomized into five groups .",3
"The mean pain scores ( standard deviation ) were 2.63 ( 1.68 ) in the 2 % group , 2.08 ( 1.35 ) in the 3.5 % ; 2.00 ( 1.65 ) in the 5 % , 1.93 ( 1.40 ) in the 8 % and 1.83 ( 1.35 ) in the 12 % group .",3
Mean pain score among all groups was similar ( p = 0.077 ) .,3
There was no significant difference between groups in regard to keratitis mean score ( p = 0.897 ) .,3
"Lidocaine gel at concentrations from 2 to 12 % induced similar anesthetic effect for IVTs , without adverse effects on cornea and conjunctiva .",4
"At 92 weeks , patients who had treatments every 12 weeks had superior BCVA to those treated on an as-needed basis every 12 weeks ( P = 0.008 ) , with the regular treatment arm gaining a mean BCVA of 5.5 letters and the as-needed treatment arm gaining 0.6 letters .",3
"The regular treatment arm of the study showed significantly improved outcomes with respect to 5 - , 10 - , and 15-letter changes in BCVA from baseline compared with the as-needed treatment arm , as well as superior reading speed .",3
"In patients who completed the study , up to but not including week 92 , the mean number of treatments was 10.8 for the regular treatment arm and 9.1 for the as-needed treatment arm .",3
A treatment regimen with regular bevacizumab injections every 12 weeks after loading doses supplemented with as-needed top-up treatments produced a stable improvement in BCVA from baseline .,4
The improvement in BCVA was broadly similar to that obtained in other studies using anti-vascular endothelial growth factor drugs with more frequent assessments and treatments .,4
Demographic and preoperative parameters were comparable between 2 groups .,3
"For stones of different locations and sizes , single-session stone fragmentation rate of PolyScope was similar to that of URF P-5 .",3
"However , for lower calyceal stones , URF P-5 was significantly better than PolyScope ( 82.0 % vs 69.2 % ; P = .022 ) .",3
"No statistically significant difference existed in single-session or overall stone-free rate , complication rate , and hospital stay .",3
"Mean operation time of PolyScope group was 92.620.2 minutes , 9minutes ( 10.8 % ) longer than that of URF P-5 group 83.317.1 minutes ( P < .01 ) .",3
"PolyScope demonstrates similar overall stone clearance rate to a conventional flexible ureteroscope in managing renal calculi < 3cm in diameter , but for lower pole stones , it is of inferior efficacy and it is more skillfully demanding , taking longer operation time .",4
Changes in FC were found between several brain regions that were common to all 3 MT interventions .,3
Treatment-dependent changes in FC were also observed between several brain regions .,3
Improvement was seen in pain intensity after all interventions ( P < .05 ) with no difference between groups ( P > .05 ) .,3
"There were no observed changes in pain sensitivity , or an association between primary and secondary outcome measures .",3
"These results suggest that MTs ( chiropractic spinal manipulation , spinal mobilization , and therapeutic touch ) have an immediate effect on the FC between brain regions involved in processing and modulating the pain experience .",4
This suggests that neurophysiologic changes after MT may be an underlying mechanism of pain relief .,4
"Pioglitazone lowered plasma insulin ( P < 0.001 ) , improved insulin sensitivity ( P < 0.001 ) , increased HDL ( P < 0.001 ) , and reduced triglycerides ( P = 0.003 ) , free fatty acids ( P = 0.005 ) , and C-reactive protein ( P = 0.001 ) .",3
"However , pioglitazone did not affect the vasodilator response to BQ-123 in the whole group ( P = 0.618 ) and in the diagnosis or insulin sensitivity subgroups .",3
"Hence , in non-diabetic patients with hypertension or hypercholesterolemia , PPAR activation with pioglitazone does not affect endothelin-1 activity , despite enhancing insulin sensitivity and reducing plasma insulin and C-reactive protein levels .",3
"In non-diabetic patients with hypertension or hypercholesterolemia , pioglitazone improves insulin sensitivity , lipid profile , and inflammation but does not affect endothelin activity .",4
Our data suggest that the determinants of endothelin-1 vascular activity in vivo may differ and/or be more complex than those suggested by the results of previous in vitro studies .,4
"In the intention-to-treat analysis , uptake of breast screening was 59.1 % among women in the normal invitation group and 64.4 % in the text-message reminder group ( ( 2 ) = 6.47 , odds ratio ( OR ) : 1.26 , 95 % confidence intervals ( CI ) : 1.05-1 .48 , P = 0.01 ) .",3
"Of the 1122 women assigned to the text-message reminder group , only 456 ( 41 % ) had a mobile number recorded by their GP and were thereby sent a text .",3
"In the per-protocol analysis , uptake by those in the control group who had a mobile number recorded on the GP system was 59.77 % and by those in the intervention group who were sent a reminder 71.7 % ( ( 2 ) = 14.12 , OR = 1.71 , 95 % CI = 1.29-2 .26 , P < 0.01 ) .",3
Sending women a text-message reminder before their first routine breast screening appointment significantly increased attendance .,4
This information can be used to allocate resources efficiently to improve uptake without exacerbating social inequalities .,4
"We analysed the effects of the exercise programme on anxiety , depression and cancer-related symptoms by using a generalised estimating equation method .",3
"The exercise group patients exhibited significant improvements in their anxiety levels over time ( P = 0.009 and 0.006 in the third and sixth months , respectively ) and depression ( P = 0.00006 and 0.004 in the third and sixth months , respectively ) than did the usual-care group patients .",3
The home-based walking exercise programme is a feasible and effective intervention method for managing anxiety and depression in lung cancer survivors and can be considered as an essential component of lung cancer rehabilitation .,4
The mean time to full enteral feeding was 10.0 days in the Re-feeding group and 11.3 days in the Fresh-feeding group ( mean difference favouring re-feeding : -1.3 days ; 95 % CI -2.9 to 0.3 ; p = 0.11 ) .,3
"The composite safety end point of spontaneous intestinal perforation , surgical necrotising enterocolitis , or death occurred in 6 of 36 infants ( 17 % ) in the Re-feeding group versus 10 of 36 infants ( 28 % ) in the Fresh-feeding group ( p = 0.26 ) .",3
Re-feeding gastric residual volumes in extremely preterm infants does not reduce time to achieve full enteral feeding .,4
"This trial suggests that re-feeding might be as safe as fresh feeding , but further research is needed , due to lack of sufficient statistical power in this study for safety analysis .",4
The raters agreed on a pass-fail rating for fifty-five of sixty videos rated with an interclass correlation coefficient value of 0.83 .,3
Ten of thirty participants were assigned passing scores by both raters for both diagnostic arthroscopies performed in the laboratory .,3
Receiver operating characteristic analysis demonstrated that logging more than eighty arthroscopic cases or performing more than thirty-five arthroscopic knee cases was predictive of attaining a passing Arthroscopic Surgery Skill Evaluation Tool score on both procedures performed in the laboratory .,3
The Arthroscopic Surgery Skill Evaluation Tool is valid and reliable as a pass-fail examination of diagnostic arthroscopy of the knee in the simulation laboratory .,4
This study demonstrates that the Arthroscopic Surgery Skill Evaluation Tool may be a useful tool for pass-fail examination of diagnostic arthroscopy of the knee in the simulation laboratory .,4
Further study is necessary to determine whether the Arthroscopic Surgery Skill Evaluation Tool can be used for the assessment of multiple arthroscopic procedures and whether it can be used to evaluate arthroscopic procedures performed in the operating room .,4
"Three hundred women ( age : mean 61 , range 45-92 ) completed both cognitive assessments and did not use hormone replacement therapy during the trial .",3
Mean on-trial change from baseline in urine excretion of isoflavonoids was not significantly associated with change in a composite score of global cognition ( P = .39 ) .,3
Secondary analyses indicated that change in urine excretion of isoflavonoids was inversely associated with change in a factor score representing general intelligence ( P = .02 ) but not with factor scores representing verbal or visual episodic memory .,3
Mean differences in this general intelligence factor score between women in the lowest and highest quartiles of isoflavonoid change were equivalent to an approximate 4.4-year age-associated decline .,3
Analyses based on plasma isoflavonoid levels yielded similar but attenuated results .,3
"In healthy postmenopausal women , long-term changes in isoflavonoids are not associated with global cognition , supporting clinical trial results , although greater isoflavonoid exposure from dietary supplements is associated with decrements in general intelligence but not memory ; this finding requires confirmation in future studies .",4
"Eighty patients were randomized equally , with 5 in the Exposure Group and 4 in the Control Group excluded from analysis .",3
Participants were evenly matched at baseline .,3
Mean duration of PPOI did not differ between Exposure and Control Groups ( 83.7 vs 101.3 hours ; P = 0.191 ) .,3
"When considering individual markers of PPOI resolution , Gastrografin did not affect time to resolution of nausea and vomiting ( 64.5 vs 74.3 hours ; P = 0.404 ) or consumption of oral diet ( 75.8 vs 90.0 hours ; P = 0.297 ) .",3
"However , it accelerated time to flatus or stool ( 18.9 vs 32.7 hours ; P = 0.047 ) and time to resolution of abdominal distension ( 52.8 vs 77.7 hours ; P = 0.013 ) .",3
"There were no significant differences between groups in nasogastric output ; analgesia , antiemetic , or fluid requirement ; complications ; or length of stay .",3
Gastrografin is not clinically useful in shortening an episode of PPOI characterized by upper and lower gastrointestinal symptoms .,4
It may however be of therapeutic benefit in the subset of PPOI patients who display lower gastrointestinal symptoms exclusively after surgery .,4
The noninferiority of the 30 % - dose PDT compared with the 50 % - dose PDT for the primary outcomes was not demonstrated .,3
"The optical coherence tomography-based improvement rate in the 30 % - dose PDT group was less than that in the 50 % - dose PDT group both at 6 months ( 73.8 % vs 92.9 % ; = 0.0125 , P = .006 ) and at 12 months ( 75.4 % vs 94.6 % ; = 0.0125 , P = .004 ) .",3
"The fluorescein angiography-based improvement rate in the 30 % - dose PDT group was less than that in the 50 % - dose PDT group both at 6 months ( 68.9 % vs 91.1 % ; = 0.0125 , P = .003 ) and at 12 months ( 68.9 % vs 92.9 % ; = 0.0125 , P = .001 ) .",3
"The subretinal fluid recurrence rate in the 30 % - dose PDT group was greater than that in the 50 % - dose PDT group ( 24.0 % vs 5.7 % at 12 months ; P = .010 , determined by use of the log-rank test ) .",3
"The fluorescein leakage recurrent rate in the 30 % - dose PDT group was significantly higher than that in the 50 % - dose PDT group ( 16.7 % vs 3.8 % at 12 months ; P = .03 , determined by use of the log-rank test ) .",3
No ocular adverse event was encountered in the study .,3
"A 50 % dose of verteporfin may be more effective at resolving subretinal fluid and fluorescein leakage , and with better visual outcomes , than a 30 % dose for acute central serous chorioretinopathy .",4
There was neither period effect nor treatment-period interaction .,3
"Both PBAV and CV could equally identify SFJ reflux , but teaching time and total examination time in PBAV was shorter than CV .",3
PBAV is a new option to exhibit reverse venous flow at SFJ by DUS .,4
PBAV is easier and spend less time than CV,4
"There were no significant differences in age , sex distribution , body weight , body mass index , waist circumference , psoriasis duration , or PASI score between the two studied groups at base line .",3
"At week 24 , the mean ( SD ) weight loss was 12.9 1.2 kg in the diet intervention group , and -1.5 0.5 kg in the control group .",3
"The average improvement in mean PASI score was 84 % for the diet group , and 69 % for the control group .",3
"PASI 75 was achieved by 85.9 % in the diet group , and 59.3 % in the control group ( p < 0.001 ) .",3
The mean ( SD ) body surface area values at week 24 were 3.3 4.4 % and 8.1 6.9 % in the diet group and control group .,3
Body weight reduction in obese patients on biologics may increase the efficacy of the drug .,4
A single session of yoga reduced both subjective and physiological measures of state anxiety ( STAI-S and cortisol ) ; and this class-induced reduction in anxiety remained at the final session of the intervention .,3
"Multiple linear regression analyses identified allocation to yoga as predictive of greater reduction in WDEQ scores ( B = -9.59 ; BCa 95 % CI = -18.25 to -0.43 ; P = .014 ; d = -0.57 ) , while allocation to TAU was predictive of significantly increased elevation in EPDS scores ( B = -3.06 ; BCa 95 % CI = -5.9 to -0.17 ; P = .042 ; d = -0.5 ) .",3
No significant differences were observed in state or trait anxiety scores between baseline and follow-up .,3
Antenatal yoga seems to be useful for reducing women 's anxieties toward childbirth and preventing increases in depressive symptomatology .,4
"Serum vitamin D levels decreased significantly from baseline to 24 weeks among those randomized to efavirenz/lamivudine/zidovudine ( mean change : -7.94 [ 95 % Confidence Interval ( CI ) -10.42 , -5.54 ] ng/ml ) and efavirenz/emtricitabine/tenofovir-DF ( mean change : -6.66 [ 95 % CI -9.40 , -3.92 ] ng/ml ) when compared to those randomized to atazanavir/emtricitabine/didanosine-EC ( mean change : -2.29 [ 95 % CI -4.83 , 0.25 ] ng/ml ) .",3
Vitamin D levels did not change significantly between week 24 and 48 .,3
"Other factors that significantly affected serum vitamin D change included country ( p < 0.001 ) , season ( p < 0.001 ) and baseline vitamin D level ( p < 0.001 ) .",3
"Efavirenz-containing cART regimens adversely affected vitamin D levels in patients from economically , geographically and racially diverse resource-limited settings .",4
This effect was most pronounced early after cART initiation .,4
Research is needed to define the role of Vitamin D supplementation in HIV care .,4
A total of 338 adult patients with major depression ( DSM-IV ) were assessed at baseline .,3
"At 36 months , 137 patients in the intervention group and 97 in the control group were assessed ( attrition 31 % ) .",3
The severity of depression ( mean Patient Health Questionnaire-9 score ) was 0.95 points lower in the intervention group [ 6.31 versus 7.25 ; p = 0.324 ] .,3
The treatment response rate was 5.6 % higher in the intervention group than in the control group [ 66.4 % versus 60.8 % ; p = 0.379 ] and the remission rate was 9.2 % higher [ 57.7 % versus 48.5 % ; p = 0.164 ] .,3
No difference reached statistical significance .,3
The number of patients lost ( 31 % ) before follow-up may have introduced a bias .,4
Clinical benefits shown in the first year were not maintained beyond : at 36 months the differences between the control group and the intervention group reduced in all the analysed variables .,4
"Management was provided by the patient 's physician , with biannual monitoring results collected by the local site .",3
"Therapeutic targets were low-density lipoprotein , cholesterol < 100 mg/dL , systolic blood pressure < 140 mm Hg , fasting blood glucose < 126 mg/dL , and nonsmoking status .",3
Optimal control was defined as achieving all 4 goals concurrently .,3
Generalized estimating equations were used to compare risk factors at baseline with those observed in scheduled follow-up visits for up to 48 months .,3
"In the analysis cohort of 2210 , significant improvements in risk-factor control were observed across risk factors for all follow-up visits compared with baseline .",3
"At 48 months , achievement of the low-density lipoprotein cholesterol goal improved from 59.1 % to 73.6 % ( P < 0.001 ) , achievement of the systolic blood pressure goal improved from 51.6 % to 65.1 % ( P < 0.001 ) , achievement of the glucose goal improved from 74.9 % to 80.7 % ( P = 0.0101 ) , and nonsmoking improved from 74.4 % to 80.9 % ( P < 0.0001 ) .",3
"The percentage with optimal risk-factor control also improved significantly , from 16.7 % to 36.2 % ( P < 0.001 ) , but nearly 2 of 3 study participants did not achieve optimal control during the study .",3
Site-based risk-factor control improved significantly in the first 6 months and over the long term in CREST but was often suboptimal .,4
Intensive medical management should be considered for future trials of carotid revascularization .,4
The achievement of complete remission in patients with thymic T-ALL ( 100 % ) was significantly higher than in those with early ( 85.7 % ) or mature ( 70 % ) variants .,3
The patients with early and mature T-ALL as compared to those with thymic T-ALL showed high death rates in the remission induction ( 7.4 and 10 % versus 0 ) and the patients with mature T-ALL had a.higher proportion of refractory forms ( 20 % versus 0 ) .,3
"The 5-year overall and relapse-free survival rates in all the T-ALL patients were 66 and 76 % , respectively .",3
"After auto-HSCT , the risk of recurrence was 0 % versus 21 % after chemotherapy ( p = 0.03 ) .",3
"The relapse-free survival rates significantly differed in the auto-HSCT and non-auto-HSCT groups : 100 and 66 % , respectively ( p = 0.047 ) .",3
"The long-term survival rates obtained during this multicenter study in the T-ALL patients treated according to the ALL-2009 protocol , the basis for which is the principle of continuity of cytostatic effects , are exclusively optimistic .",4
"Late consolidation with auto-HSCT following non-myeloablative BEAM conditioning , followed by maintenance therapy , considerably reduces the risk of recurrence .",4
"At follow-up , the mean item change in trauma symptom score was -1.54 ( 95 % CI , -1.81 to -1.27 ) , a reduction of 81.9 % , for the TF-CBT group and -0.37 ( 95 % CI , -0.57 to -0.17 ) , a reduction of 21.1 % , for the TAU group .",3
"The mean item change for functioning was -0.76 ( 95 % CI , -0.98 to -0.54 ) , a reduction of 89.4 % , and -0.54 ( 95 % CI , -0.80 to -0.29 ) , a reduction of 68.3 % , for the TF-CBT and TAU groups , respectively .",3
The difference in change between groups was statistically significant for both outcomes ( P < .001 ) .,3
The effect size ( Cohen d ) was 2.39 for trauma symptoms and 0.34 for functioning .,3
Lay counselors participated in supervision and assessed whether the intervention was provided with fidelity in all 5 community settings .,3
The TF-CBT adapted for Zambia substantially decreased trauma and stress-related symptoms and produced a smaller improvement in functional impairment among OVC having experienced high levels of trauma .,4
The study enrolled 60 eyes of 30 patients .,3
The mean astigmatism vector reduction was 1.74 D 0.64 ( SD ) in the toric IOL group and 1.27 0.76 D in the PCRI group ; the difference was statistically significant ( P = .042 ) .,3
The mean absolute rotation of the toric IOL was 2.5 1.8 degrees ( maximum 6.3 degrees ) in the first 6 postoperative months .,3
Astigmatism increased in the PCRI group between the 1-month and 6-month follow-up ( mean 0.38 0.27 D ; maximum 1.00 D ) ( P < .001 ) .,3
"Toric IOLs and PCRIs both reduced astigmatism ; however , toric IOLs reduced astigmatism to a higher extent and they were more predictable .",4
"The ACR20/ACR50/ACR70 response rates of DB completers ( n = 98 ) were 82.7 % / 56.1 % / 34.7 % at OLE entry , and 83.7 % / 65.3 % / 48.0 % at 52 weeks , respectively .",3
"Other clinical , functional , and radiographic outcomes were sustained during long-term administration of CZP , even without MTX .",3
No new unexpected adverse events were observed during long-term CZP treatment .,3
The efficacy and safety of CZP treatment were similar between the two dosing schedules .,3
Long-term CZP administration is efficacious and safe for RA patients .,4
No obvious differences in clinical efficacy and safety were observed between the two dosing schedules .,4
The choice between two maintenace regimens adds flexibility in administration schedules for RA patients and physicians .,4
Forty-one patients completed the study .,3
"The mean ( standard deviation ) 24-h IOP was 16.82.0 mmHg at baseline , 14.42.2 mmHg on tafluprost , and 13.61.8 mmHg on travoprost .",3
"Both prostaglandin monotherapies significantly reduced mean 24-h IOP as compared with baseline ( P < 0.001 , P < 0.001 , respectively ) , and travoprost demonstrated a lower mean 24-h IOP than tafluprost ( P = 0.044 ) .",3
Both treatments significantly reduced the IOP from baseline at every point over 24h .,3
"At 3 individual time points , travoprost provided a lower IOP than tafluprost : at 4 PM ( 13.82.7 vs. 14.82.6 mmHg , P = 0.041 ) , at 6 PM ( 13.52.5 vs. 14.42.5 mmHg , P = 0.006 ) , and at 8 PM ( 13.32.5 vs. 14.52.4 mmHg , P = 0.029 ) .",3
"Both tafluprost and travoprost significantly increased the 24-h MOPP ( P = 0.008 , P = 0.002 , respectively ) , and travoprost demonstrated a greater 24-h MOPP than tafluprost ( P = 0.027 ) .",3
Both tafluprost and travoprost were effective in lowering IOP and increasing MOPP throughout 24h in NTG .,4
"However , travoprost reduced IOP greater than tafluprost in the late afternoon and evening .",4
"GAA intervention significantly increased serum and urinary GAA , Cr and creatinine as compared to placebo ( P < 0.05 ) .",3
"Differences were found for serum GAA and Cr responses between the three GAA dosages , with high-dose GAA resulting in a greater increase ( P < 0.05 ) in the plasma concentration of both variables as compared to other GAA dosages .",3
"In GAA groups , fasting plasma total homocysteine ( T-Hcy ) increased by 3.5 mol/L on average at post-administration , yet no dose-response differences were found between trials .",3
Serum B vitamins were not affected by either placebo or GAA intervention ( P > 0.05 ) .,3
Results indicate that low-to-high dosages of exogenous GAA can increase serum concentrations of Cr and T-Hcy while not depleting the B vitamins pool available for remethylation of homocysteine .,4
"A total of 96 participants were randomized , 31 to group 1 , 31 to group 2 , and 32 to group 3 .",3
There were 2 postrandomization exclusions .,3
"In the multivariate analysis , we found no evidence that the intervention had an effect on VR performance as represented by 6 calculated subscores of accuracy , time , and path length for ( 1 ) camera manipulation and ( 2 ) hand-eye coordination combined with 2-handed maneuvers ( p = 0.795 ) .",3
"Neither the comparison of the average of the intervention groups ( groups 1 and 2 ) vs control ( group 3 ) nor the pairwise comparisons revealed any significant differences in VR performance , neither multivariate nor univariate .",3
"VR performance improved with increasing performance score in the cognitive exercise warm-up ( iPad 3D puzzle ) for accuracy , time , and path length in the camera navigation task .",3
We were unable to show an effect of the 2 tested warm-up strategies on VR performance in laypersons .,4
"We are currently designing a follow-up study including surgeons rather than laypersons with a longer warm-up exercise , which is more closely related to the final task .",4
HER2 mRNA levels were obtained for 116/137 patients ( HT = 61 ; T-DM1 = 55 ) .,3
Median pretreatment HER2 mRNA was 8.9 .,3
The risk of disease progression in the overall population was lower with T-DM1 than with HT ( hazard ratio ( HR ) = 0.59 ; 95 % confidence interval ( CI ) 0.36 to 0.97 ) .,3
This effect was more pronounced in patients with HER2 mRNAmedian ( HR = 0.39 ; 95 % CI 0.18 to 0.85 ) versus < median ( HR = 0.85 ; 95 % CI 0.44 to 1.67 ) .,3
"In the T-DM1 arm , median progression-free survival ( PFS ) was not reached in patients with HER2 mRNAmedian and was 10.6 months in patients with HER2 mRNA < median .",3
"In the HT arm , PFS was 8.8 versus 9.8 months in patients with HER2 mRNAmedian versus < median , respectively .",3
The effect of HER2 mRNA expression on objective response rates was less pronounced .,3
"This exploratory analysis suggests that while overall , patients with HER2-positive MBC show improved PFS with T-DM1 relative to HT , the effect is enhanced in patients with tumor HER2 mRNAmedian .",4
There were significant differences in the AUC ( 0-5h ) for the self-reported feelings of satisfaction ( P = 0.04 ) and desire to eat ( P = 0.05 ) in the mixed model analysis .,3
"Compared to the C test meal , the AA test meal increased satisfaction by 23 % ( P = 0.05 ) and decreased the desire to eat by 28 % ( P = 0.04 ) for the AUC ( 0-5h ) .",3
"For the AUC ( 0-3h ) , the AA test meal increased satisfaction by 26 % ( P = 0.02 ) and decreased the desire to eat by 40 % ( P = 0.01 ) as compared to the C test meal .",3
"Compared to the AI meal , the AUC ( 0-3h ) for blood insulin was higher in the C and AA meals ( P = 0.04 and P = 0.05 , respectively ) .",3
The addition of approximately one half of a Hass avocado at a lunch meal can influence post-ingestive satiety over a subsequent 3 and 5 hour period in overweight adults .,4
"A caveat to these findings is that the avocado contained an additional 112 kcal , which may have accounted for the observed increase in satisfaction and decreased desire to eat .",4
Future trials are warranted to evaluate the effects of avocado intake on weight management in adults of varying BMIs and among insulin resistant individuals .,4
Paired ENFD was available from 118 patients .,3
"Median age , CD4 cell count , and height at entry were 34 years , 172 cells/l , and 162 cm , respectively .",3
"Major haplogroups included M ( 42 % ) , F ( 21 % ) , and B ( 16 % ) .",3
"Baseline ENFD , CD4 cell count , randomized ART , and biomarkers did not differ by haplogroup .",3
"Haplogroup B patients were older ( P = 0.02 ) at baseline , and had an increase in median ENFD ( +1.5 vs. -2.9 fibers/mm ; P = 0.03 ) and 8-oxo-dG break frequency ( +0.05 vs. 0.00 ; P = 0.05 ) compared to other haplogroups .",3
"In a multivariate model , haplogroup B was associated with increased ENFD ( = 3.5 , P = 0.009 ) at week 24 , whereas older age ( P = 0.02 ) , higher baseline CD4 cell count , ( P = 0.03 ) , higher complex I level ( P = 0.03 ) , and higher ENFD ( P < 0.001 ) at baseline were all associated with decreased ENFD .",3
Three of the six HIV-SN cases were haplogroup B ( P = 0.05 ) .,3
"Thai persons belonging to mtDNA haplogroup B had increased ENFD and 8-oxo-dG on ART , and were more likely to develop HIV-SN .",4
These results suggest that mtDNA variation influences early oxidative damage and ENFD changes .,4
"Overall 12 ( 20 % ) patients developed CPSP , 8 ( 30 % ) in the placebo group and 4 ( 12 % ) in the lidocaine group .",3
"Predictive factors for CPSP that remained significant after multivariate analysis included lidocaine ( associated with a 20-fold decrease in CPSP , P = 0.013 ) , breast implant placement ( associated with a 16-fold increase in CPSP , P = 0.034 ) , and radiotherapy ( associated with a 29-fold increase in CPSP , P = 0.008 ) .",3
Small sample size .,4
"Perioperative lidocaine administration was associated with a decreased incidence of CPSP , while breast implant placement and radiotherapy were associated with an increased incidence .",4
These findings suggest a protective effect of lidocaine on CPSP development in mastectomy patients .,4
Data were provided by 151 of 244 eligible survivors ( 62 % ) at a median age at assessment of 15.2 years and median interval from diagnosis of 5.8 years .,3
"Compared with standard radiation therapy , hyperfractionated radiation therapy was associated with lower ( ie , better ) z-scores for executive function in all participants ( mean intergroup difference 0.48 SDs , 95 % confidence interval 0.16-0 .81 , P = .004 ) , but health status , behavioral difficulties , and health-related quality of life z-scores were similar in the 2 treatment arms .",3
Data on hearing impairment were equivocal .,3
"Hyperfractionated radiation therapy was also associated with greater decrement in height z-scores ( mean intergroup difference 0.43 SDs , 95 % confidence interval 0.10-0 .76 , P = .011 ) .",3
"Hyperfractionated radiation therapy was associated with better executive function and worse growth but without accompanying change in health status , behavior , or quality of life .",4
The gender specific models consistently identified motor coordination and the parents ' perceptions of their child 's activity preferences during free play to be positively associated with MVPA .,3
Days with rain or no preschool attendance were negatively associated with MVPA .,3
"For boys , rural area and the size of the preschool playground were positively associated with MVPA , whereas for girls , it was the age and the relative preschool indoor area .",3
Individual and overall environmental correlates of MVPA were identified .,4
"However , most correlates were not or only weakly related to MVPA .",4
It is possible that the interaction with peers and surrounding adults might contribute the most to preschool child MVPA .,4
"Both CCT alone and combined with tDCS ameliorated depressive symptoms after the acute treatment period and at follow-up , with a response rate of approximately 25 % .",3
Older patients and those who presented better performance in the task throughout the trial ( possibly indicating greater engagement and activation of the DLPFC ) had greater depression improvement in the combined treatment group .,3
Our exploratory findings should be further confirmed in prospective controlled trials .,4
"CCT and tDCS combined might be beneficial for older depressed patients , particularly for those who have cognitive resources to adequately learn and improve task performance over time .",4
This combined therapy might be specifically relevant in this subgroup that is more prone to present cognitive decline and prefrontal cortical atrophy .,4
The primary end point was the median depth of thermal injury measured in millimeters .,3
"The secondary end points included the proportion of subjects who developed granulation tissue , induration , infection , or dehiscence at the vaginal cuff at 4weeks , 3months , or 6months postoperatively .",3
"There was no significant difference in the median depth of thermal injury in the cut/coag and V mode arms ( anterior margin : 0.68 mm vs 0.63 mm [ p = .94 ] , posterior margin : 0.66 mm vs 0.70 mm [ p = .87 ] , respectively ) .",3
"Twenty-seven percent of subjects in each arm developed at least 1 of the clinical end points at 4weeks , 3months , or 6months postoperatively ( granulation tissue : 6 % -18 % vs 8 % -21 % , induration : 0 % -2 % vs 4 % -5 % , infection : 0 % -4 % vs 0 % -10 % , dehiscence : 2 % vs 0 % in the cut/coag and V mode arms , respectively ) , with no difference between arms ( p = 1.0 ) .",3
The V mode does not reduce the depth of thermal injury compared with cut/coag electrothermal energy when used for colpotomy incision during total laparoscopic hysterectomy ( Clinical Trials.gov ID : NCT02080546 ) .,4
The mean baseline microflora recovery was 3.24 log10 cfu/cm ( 2 ) .,3
"The mean log reductions from baseline measured from underneath the CHG-containing dressings were 0.87 , 0.78 and 1.30 log10 cfu/cm ( 2 ) on days 1 , 4 and 7 , respectively , compared with log reductions of 0.67 , -0.87 and -1.29 log10 cfu/cm ( 2 ) from underneath the control film dressings .",3
"There was no significant difference between the log reductions of the two treatments on day 1 , but on days 4 and 7 the log reduction associated with the CHG adhesive was significantly higher than that associated with the control adhesive .",3
The adhesive containing CHG was associated with a sustained antimicrobial effect that was not present in the control .,4
"Incorporating the antimicrobial into the adhesive layer confers upon it bactericidal properties in marked contrast to the non-antimicrobial adhesive , which contributed to bacterial proliferation when the wear time was 4 days .",4
The SORT OUT VII trial will determine whether the biodegradable polymers O-SES is noninferior to the N-BES with respect to driven event .,4
"Between Dec 21 , 2012 , and Jan 10 , 2014 , we screened 631 patients , randomly allocating 272 patients to nivolumab and 133 to ICC .",3
"Confirmed objective responses were reported in 38 ( 317 % , 95 % CI 235-408 ) of the first 120 patients in the nivolumab group versus five ( 106 % , 35-231 ) of 47 patients in the ICC group .",3
"Grade 3-4 adverse events related to nivolumab included increased lipase ( three [ 1 % ] of 268 patients ) , increased alanine aminotransferase , anaemia , and fatigue ( two [ 1 % ] each ) ; for ICC , these included neutropenia ( 14 [ 14 % ] of 102 ) , thrombocytopenia ( six [ 6 % ] ) , and anaemia ( five [ 5 % ] ) .",3
We noted grade 3-4 drug-related serious adverse events in 12 ( 5 % ) nivolumab-treated patients and nine ( 9 % ) patients in the ICC group .,3
No treatment-related deaths occurred .,3
Nivolumab led to a greater proportion of patients achieving an objective response and fewer toxic effects than with alternative available chemotherapy regimens for patients with advanced melanoma that has progressed after ipilimumab or ipilimumab and a BRAF inhibitor .,4
Nivolumab represents a new treatment option with clinically meaningful durable objective responses in a population of high unmet need .,4
"A multivariate analysis of variance revealed significant group differences in pre-to-post changes on measures of VHI , maximum phonation time , and cepstral peak prominence ( CPP ) in connected speech and vowels ( P = 0.003 , 0.013 , 0.025 , and 0.017 respectively ) , with a significant reduction of VHI ( Cohen 's d = 1.6 ) , increase in maximum phonation time ( Cohen 's d = 1.2 ) , increase of CPP in connected speech ( Cohen 's d = 1.2 ) , and increase of CPP in vowels ( Cohen 's d = 1.1 ) in the experimental group compared to the control group .",3
"This preliminary small sample randomized controlled trial found significantly greater improvement in vocal handicap , maximum phonation time , and acoustic measures of vocal function after participants received stretch-and-flow voice therapy compared to participants receiving vocal hygiene education alone .",4
Additional research incorporating larger samples will be needed to confirm and further investigate these findings .,4
"Of 4603 clients , 3424 ( 74.4 % ) tested negative by double-read research slides .",3
"The proportion of slide-negative clients who received any antimalarial was 590/1854 ( 32 % ) in the intervention arm and 1378/1570 ( 88 % ) in the control arm ( adjusted risk ratio 0.41 ( 95 % CI 0.29 to 0.58 ) , P < 0.0001 ) .",3
Treatment was in high agreement with rapid diagnostic test result .,3
"Of those who were slide-positive , 690/787 ( 87.8 % ) in the intervention arm and 347/392 ( 88.5 % ) in the control arm received an artemisinin combination therapy ( adjusted risk ratio 0.96 ( 0.84 to 1.09 ) ) .",3
There was no evidence of antibiotics being substituted for antimalarials .,3
"Overall , 1954/2641 ( 74 % ) clients in the intervention arm and 539/1962 ( 27 % ) in the control arm received appropriate treatment ( adjusted risk ratio 2.39 ( 1.69 to 3.39 ) , P < 0.0001 ) .",3
No safety concerns were identified .,3
Most patients with fever in Africa present to the private sector .,4
"In this trial , providing rapid diagnostic tests for malaria in the private drug retail sector significantly reduced dispensing of antimalarials to patients without malaria , did not reduce prescribing of antimalarials to true malaria cases , and appeared safe .",4
Rapid diagnostic tests should be considered for the informal private drug retail sector.Registration Clinicaltrials.gov NCT01907672 .,4
After 14 days of treatment there was an absolute decrease in fibrin and necrotic tissue of 37.6 29.9 percentage points in the PA-based hydrogel group and by 16.8 23.0 percentage points in the amorphous hydrogel group .,3
The absolute increase in the proportion of ulcer area covered by granulation tissue was 36.0 27.4 percentage points in the PA-based hydrogel group and 14.5 22.0 percentage points in the control group .,3
"The differences between the groups were significant ( decrease in fibrin and necrotic tissue P = 0.004 and increase in granulation tissue P = 0.0005 , respectively ) .",3
"In particular , long-standing wounds profited from the treatment with the PA-based hydrogel .",4
"These data suggest that PA-based hydrogel dressings can stimulate normalization of the wound environment , particularly in hard-to-heal ulcers .",4
"Calves vaccinated with the MLV vaccine containing M haemolytica toxoid had significantly lower lung lesion scores , mortality rate , and clinical scores for respiratory disease , compared with results for control calves .",3
"Administration of a multivalent MLV vaccine containing M haemolytica toxoid protected calves against challenge exposure with virulent B trehalosi by reducing the mortality rate , lung lesion scores , and clinical scores for respiratory disease .",4
"The rate of ongoing pregnancy was not significantly different between the two groups ( clinic : 2.7 % phone , 2.5 % , relative risk 0.9 , 95 % confidence interval 0.99-1 .02 ) .",3
Eighty-five percent of women in the phone group did not need an additional clinic visit .,3
"Phone follow-up was highly effective in screening for ongoing pregnancy with a sensitivity and specificity of 92.8 % and 90.6 % , respectively .",3
"Specificity of the pregnancy test alone ( eg , without the symptom checklist ) was higher ( 95.7 % ) .",3
Phone follow-up offers a feasible and effective approach to identify women with ongoing pregnancy after early medical abortion .,4
"When used with the semiquantitative pregnancy test , the symptom checklist offered no additional benefit and decreased the specificity of the screening .",4
"Given its effectiveness and ease of use , the semiquantitative pregnancy test alone could replace routine clinic follow-up after early medical abortion .",4
"Using LCGA , we identified three subgroups with different trajectories of weight change , one large group ( n = 298 ) with almost no change over time , and two smaller groups ( both n = 48 ) , of which one represents participants who steadily gained weight over time , whereas the other represents participants who steadily lost weight over time .",3
Participants that had relatively low body weight around their 40th year of life and that gained weight in the year preceding the study were most likely to belong to the group that lost weight .,3
LCGA was a suitable method to identify three distinct groups of participants with different trajectories of weight change .,4
Low body weight at age 40 and weight gain in the year preceding the study were associated with a higher chance of membership of thegroup that lost weight .,4
It seems weight loss that occurred during this weight loss intervention was mostly recently gained weight .,4
Six CM patients ( 20 % ) and 2 UM patients ( 40 % ) reported visual symptoms during the study .,3
"The median time to the onset of symptoms , which were all mild and transient , was 3.5 days ( range , < 1 hour to 3 weeks ) .",3
"On OCT , subretinal fluid ( SRF ) was detected in 77 % of CM patients and 60 % of UM patients .",3
"In the 26 patients with SRF , the fovea was affected in 85 % .",3
"After the start of the medication , an EOG was performed in 19 eyes of 11 patients ; 16 of these eyes ( 84 % ) developed SRF on OCT. .",3
Fifteen of these eyes ( 94 % ) showed an abnormal Arden ratio ( < 1.65 ) .,3
"A broad pattern of anti-retinal antibodies was found in 3 CM patients and 2 UM patients tested , whereas anti-RPE antibodies were detected in all 6 tested patients .",3
A time-dependent and reversible serous retinopathy can develop both in patients with metastatic CM and UM treated with binimetinib .,4
"A minority of patients develop visual symptoms , which are generally mild and transient .",4
"A cause of binimetinib-associated serous retinopathy may be toxicity of medication , but autoantibodies also may be involved .",4
"A total of 847 patients were enrolled , and 623 were available for efficacy analysis .",3
"Out of 847 patients , 80.3 % of the patients had moderate to severe disease activity , and 67.6 % were steroid refractory .",3
"As concomitant medications , 5-aminosalicylic acids , corticosteroids , and thiopurines were administered to 94.8 % , 63.8 % , and 32.8 % of the patients , respectively .",3
"In addition , infliximab and tacrolimus were concomitantly used in 5.8 % and 12.3 % , respectively .",3
Intensive leukocytapheresis ( 4 leukocytapheresis sessions within the first 2 weeks ) was used in > 70 % of the patients .,3
"Adverse events were seen in 10.3 % ( 87/847 ) , which were severe in only 5 patients ( 0.6 % ) .",3
Any concomitant medications did not increase the incidence of adverse events .,3
Intensive leukocytapheresis was as safe as the conventional weekly procedure .,3
"The overall clinical remission rate was 68.9 % ( 429/623 ) , and the mucosal healing rate was 62.5 % ( 145/232 ) .",3
Clinical remission was achieved more frequently and rapidly in the intensive group than in the weekly group .,3
"This large-scale study indicates that leukocytapheresis , including intensive procedure , is a safe and effective therapeutic option for active ulcerative colitis .",4
"There was no significant reduction in propofol requirements after the administration of 0.5 mg/kg lidocaine from 8.5 g/ml [ confidence interval ( CI ) 6.0-11 .625 ] to 8.25 g/ml ( CI 6.75-9 .76 ) ; however , a bolus of 1.5 mg/kg lidocaine decreased the Cp50 value of propofol by 42 % from 8.5 g/ml ( CI 6.0-11 .625 ) to 4.92 g/ml ( CI 4.5-5 .78 ) ( P < 0.05 ) .",3
An intravenous bolus injection of 1.5 mg/kg lidocaine 2 % caused a significant reduction of the propofol Cp50 value .,4
The surgical outcome was assessed in 25 eyes with MCI and 21 eyes with BCI .,3
The mean ( SD ) age of treatment was 52.7 ( 18.6 ) years for MCI and 49 ( 18.8 ) years for BCI .,3
Treatment success was achieved in 19 of 25 eyes ( 76 % ) in the MCI group compared with 16 of 21 eyes ( 76.2 % ) in the BCI group .,3
Differences between the 2 groups proved to be not significant ( P = 0.9 ) .,3
The only complication was peripunctal pyogenic granuloma in 2 eyes with BCI .,3
Both MCI and BCI were successful in a similar percentage of patients with NLDS .,4
The main advantages of the former technique were simple insertion and easy removal of the tube .,4
"Mean onset time of sensorial block in 6mg group was significantly longer than that of sensorial block in 10mg , 12mg and 14mg groups ( p < 0.01 ) , 8mg was longer than 12mg and 14mg ( p < 0.01 ) , and 10mg onset time of sensorial block was significantly longer than 12mg and 14mg ( p < 0.01 ) .",3
"Mean onset time of T10 sensory level in 6mg group was significantly longer than mean onset time of T10 sensory level in 10mg , 12mg and 14mg ( p < 0.01 ) , the mean onset time of T10 sensory level in 8mg group was also significantly longer than that of 12mg , 14mg groups ( p < 0.01 ) .",3
"ED ( 50 ) and ED ( 95 ) of levobupivacaine coadministered with 25 mcg fentanyl were 7.32 mg and 10.88 mg , respectively .",3
"Levobupivacaine with opioid co-administration can be used in doses considerably lower than doses proposed for routine use as it is a safe drug depending on its hemodynamic effects , side effects .",4
Demographic data were similar in both groups .,3
Rates of additional analgesia requirement at the postoperative 60th minute and 2nd hour were significantly higher in Group 2 than Group 1 ( p < 0.05 ) .,3
"Rates of nausea-vomiting at the postoperative 60th minute and 2nd hour were significantly higher in Group 1 than Group 2 ( p < 0.05 and p < 0.01 , respectively ) .",3
Bromage scores at 60 minutes and 2 hours was significantly higher in Group 1 than in Group 2 ( p < 0.01 ) .,3
Mean VAS scores at 60 minutes and 2 hours were significantly higher in Group 2 than Group 1 ( p < 0.05 ) .,3
"While a statistically significant difference was found between systolic arterial pressure measurements at 60 minutes ( p < 0.05 ) , there was no significant difference in diastolic arterial pressure and peak heart rate .",3
"Although the analgesic effect of local infiltration is provided later than by epidural analgesia , the same level of pain control can be achieved with initial additional analgesia .",4
Local infiltration is superior to epidural analgesia in respect of few side effects and early mobilization .,4
The Akreos AO group obtained statistically significantly lower values of HOAs and spherical aberration compared with the Akreos Fit group .,3
There was a statistically significant between-group difference in contrast sensitivity under mesopic conditions at all spatial frequencies .,3
No statistically significant differences were observed in mean deviation and pattern standard deviation .,3
"The aspheric IOL exhibited higher MACS in all areas , although a statistically significant difference was reached only in the 20-degree field area ( P = 0.043 ) .",3
"Aspheric IOLs significantly reduced spherical aberration and HOAs , improving mesopic contrast sensitivity .",4
"Although there was a trend toward slightly improved FDT in the aspheric IOL group , it was not statistically significant .",4
This study increases insight into performing practice-based randomized controlled trials .,4
The outcome will help to evaluate the effect of two guidance strategies on safety violations .,4
"If these strategies are effective , implementation of these strategies through the national institute of safety and health or labor inspectorate can take place to guide construction companies in complying with safety regulations .",4
"Higher worksite NSES was associated with more walking ( OR = 1.16 , 95 % CI = 1.03 , 1.30 , p = 0.01 ) .",3
"Higher density of residential units surrounding worksites was associated with more walking and eating five or more daily servings of fruits and vegetables , independent of worksite NSES .",3
"Residential density partially explained relationships among worksite NSES , fruit and vegetable consumption , and walking .",3
Worksite neighborhood context may influence employees ' obesogenic behaviors .,4
"Furthermore , residential density around worksites could be an indicator of access to dietary and physical activity-related infrastructure in urban areas .",4
This may be important given the popularity of worksites as venues for obesity prevention efforts .,4
"Morbidities related to nondegradable packing were significantly higher than with degradable packing ( Wilcoxon signed rank test , P < .01 ) .",3
"Pain , bleeding , nasal blockage , and facial edema were significantly less with absorbable packing .",3
"No statistically significant difference was found between sinonasal cavities packed with biodegradable or nondegradable materials with regard to healing scores and percentage of re-epithelialization at 2 weeks , 1 month , 3 months , 6 months , and surgical outcomes at 1 year ( P > .05 ) .",3
"However , healing at 6 months was correlated with the preoperative Lund-Mackay radiology and surgery scores ( Spearman 's rho correlation test , P < .05 and P < .01 , respectively ) .",3
No significant healing or surgical outcome differences were found between biodegradable and nondegradable packing .,4
"However pain , bleeding , nasal blockage , and facial edema were lower with biodegradable packing .",4
"Six-month biologically-confirmed smoking cessations rates were 4 % usual care , 0 % lung age , 14 % contingency management and 0 % for combined lung age and contingency management ( p = 0.13 ) .",3
There were no differences in secondary endpoints comparing the four interventions or when pooling the lung age groups .,3
"Comparing contingency management to non-contingency management , 6-month cessation rates were not different ( 7 % vs. 2 % ; p = 0.36 ) , but total number of visits with exhaled carbon monoxide-confirmed abstinence were higher for contingency management than non-contingency management participants ( 0.38 vs. 0.06 ; p = 0.03 ) , and more contingency management participants showed reduction in their Fagerstrom score from baseline to follow-up ( 39 % vs. 18 % ; p = 0.03 ) .",3
"While lung age appeared ineffective , contingency management was associated with more short-term abstinence and lowered nicotine addiction .",4
Contingency management may be a useful tool in development of effective tobacco cessation strategies among current and former injection drug users .,4
Twenty-two women completed the study .,3
"In both normal-weight and obese women , peak serum concentration ( Cmax ) , area under the curve ( AUC ) , and average hCG concentration were higher after i.m. injection as compared with s.c. injection ( all P < .003 ) .",3
"Obese women had markedly lower Cmax , AUC , and average hCG concentration after s.c. injection as compared with normal-weight women ( P = .02 , P = .009 , and P = .008 , respectively ) .",3
"After i.m. injection , Cmax , AUC , and average concentration were similar for normal-weight and obese women ( P = .31 , P = .25 , and P = .18 , respectively ) .",3
Thirty-six percent of obese women had muscular layers beyond the reach of a standard 1.5 inch needle .,3
hCG caused a significant rise in 17-OHP in both obese and normal-weight women and an increase in T in obese but not normal-weight women ( all P < .04 ) .,3
Subcutaneous injection yields lower hCG levels in obese women .,4
Standard-length needles are insufficient to administer i.m. injections in many obese women .,4
"We demonstrate the proposed analysis technique using data from the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension ( DASH ) study , a multicenter , randomized , parallel arm feeding study that tested the effects of dietary patterns on blood pressure .",3
"The linear mixed model is relatively easy to implement ( given the complexity of the technique ) using available software , allows for straightforward testing of multiple hypotheses , and the results can be presented to research clinicians using both graphical and tabular displays .",4
Using orthonormal polynomials provides the ability to model the nonlinear trajectories of each subject with the same complexity as the mean model ( fixed effects ) .,4
There is no consensus regarding patellar resurfacing during primary TKA .,4
Current prospective studies fail to determine any differences in clinical outcome among patients after TKA with or without patellar resurfacing .,4
"This randomized controlled trial has been designed to determine the effectiveness of patellar resurfacing during TKA in patients undergoing TKA who have clinical and radiological signs of tibiofemoral and patellofemoral OA , using a specific patellofemoral outcome measurement .",4
"Fifty-one subjects ( 25 and 26 in the active treatment and placebo groups , respectively ) were assessed before and during the pollen season .",3
The mean pre - vs in-season increase in EBT was significantly smaller ( by 59.1 % ) in the active treatment than in the placebo group ( P = .030 ) .,3
"Of the other objective markers , only the blood periostin level increased significantly during the pollen season ( P = .047 ) , but without intergroup differences .",3
"Subjectively , the mean pre - vs in-season increase in the visual analog scale score was 32.3 % smaller in the active treatment than in the placebo group , although this difference did not reach statistical significance ( P = .116 ) .",3
"These results suggest that the efficacy of grass pollen sublingual immunotherapy can be assessed by EBT , a putative quantitative measurement of airway inflammation , which is superior in its power to discriminate between active and placebo treatment than a subjective assessment of symptoms assessed on a visual analog scale .",4
"Mean daily step counts were 4,765 ; participants spent 589 minutes in sedentary behaviors , 141 minutes in low-intensity activities , 30 minutes in moderate-intensity lifestyle activities , and 16 minutes in moderate - to vigorous-intensity ambulatory activities .",3
No differences were found between weekdays and weekend days .,3
"Patterns were characterized by a rise in total PA in the morning , peaking between 10 am and 3 pm , and a gradual decline toward the late evening .",3
"The proportion achieving 150 minutes of moderate - to vigorous-intensity PA per week was 27 % , and 16 % achieved 7,000 or more steps per day .",3
Nonrandomized selection of participants may limit the generalizability of the results .,4
"Physical activity levels were generally low , in terms of both total volume and intensity , with only minor variations over the course of a day or between days .",4
These results emphasize the need to develop strategies to increase PA and reduce time spent in sedentary behaviors in elderly people with mild to moderate PD .,4
"No significant differences between the 2 groups in terms of quality of life , pain control , or other somatic parameters were detected after a median of 16 years postoperatively .",3
"Mortality was comparable after Beger and Frey procedures at 39 % vs 34 % , respectively , with postoperative survivals of 13.0 1.1 years and 13.3 0.9 years , respectively ( p = 0.660 ) .",3
No statistically significant differences were found in rates of endocrine insufficiency ( Beger 87 % vs Frey 86 % ; p = 0.953 ) or exocrine insufficiency ( Beger 77 % vs Frey 83 % ; p = 0.655 ) .,3
Duodenum-preserving resections of the pancreatic head offered good and permanent pain relief and substantially increased quality of life in chronic pancreatitis .,4
"Overall , a 16-year long-term follow-up found comparable outcomes for the Beger and Frey procedures .",4
"Week 26 mean HbA1c reductions from baseline ( 8.45 % ) were -1.22 and -1.55 % with A+M 12.5 / 500 and 12.5 / 1000 versus -0.56 , -0.65 , and -1.11 % with A12 .5 , M500 and M1000 ( p < 0.001 , A+M vs. component monotherapies ) .",3
"FPG reductions were -1.76 and -2.55 mmol/L with 12.5 / 500 and 12.5 / 1000 versus -0.54 , -0.64 and -1.78 mmol/L with A12 .5 , M500 and M1000 ( p < 0.05 , A+M vs. component monotherapies ) .",3
"Significantly more A+M - treated patients achieved HbA1c < 7 % ( 47.1-59 .5 % vs. 20.2-34 .3 % with monotherapy ) , significantly fewer required hyperglycaemic rescue ( 2.6-12 .3 % vs. 10.8-22 .9 % with monotherapy ) .",3
A+M caused only mild/moderate hypoglycaemia ( 1.9-5 .3 % ) and weight loss ( 0.6-1 .2 kg ) .,3
Alogliptin plus metformin initial combination therapy was well tolerated yet more efficacious in controlling glycaemia in drug-nave T2DM patients than either as monotherapy .,4
"A significant reduction was seen in clinical parameters , inflammatory infiltrates , and the argyrophilic nucleolar organizer region count within the groups .",3
The effect of topical + intrasulcular gel was equivalent to scaling ( P > 0.05 ) .,3
Topical + intrasulcular hyaluronan gel application demonstrated a better reduction than topical hyaluronan gel alone .,3
"Hyaluronan gel is an effective topical agent for treating gingivitis , along with scaling and intrasulcular application .",4
The argyrophilic nucleolar organizer region count can be used as a histopathological indicator in cases of non-responsive gingivitis to assess the severity of gingival inflammation .,4
We analyzed 332 paired responses ( physicians with adults or with parents and children ) at study entry and 339 at exit .,3
Factor analysis showed that the full DCS is not a valid dyadic measure .,3
"However , independent analysis of each subscale showed measurement invariance for values clarity , support , and effective decision ( comparative fit index range , 0.93-1 ; root mean square error of approximation range , 0-0 .07 ; and P-value > 0.05 ) .",3
Application of our dyadic validation criterion indicated that the full DCS can not be considered a dyadic measure .,4
"However , three of its subscales , values clarity , support and effective decision , are valid dyadic measures .",4
Sixty participants ( 89.55 % ) completed the study .,3
"Those who completed the trial in the intervention group ( n = 30 ) demonstrated significantly greater improvements in knowledge than did those in the control group ( n = 30 ) , scoring , on average , almost 1 point more ( 95 % CI for the difference , 0.305-1 .602 ; P = 0.005 ) on the final questionnaire .",3
"Ethnicity had a statistically significant effect on improvement in knowledge , but sex did not .",3
No harm to any patient was noted during the trial .,3
Presenting audiovisual information through the YouTube Web site to orthodontic patients resulted in a significant improvement in patient knowledge .,4
Supplementation of verbal and written patient information with audiovisual information via the Internet is therefore worthy of consideration .,4
The proportion of foals that recovered without the need to be removed from the study was significantly higher for foals treated with gamithromycin ( 38 of 40 ) or azithromycin with rifampin ( 39 of 40 ) than for controls ( 32 of 41 ) .,3
Treatment with gamithromycin or with azithromycin-rifampin resulted in a significantly faster decrease in the clinical score and abscess score compared to the controls .,3
Adverse reactions characterized by colic ( n = 18 ) and hind limb lameness ( n = 14 ) were observed only in foals treated with gamithromycin .,3
Gamithromycin was noninferior to azithromycin with rifampin for the treatment of bronchopneumonia in the study population but had a higher frequency of adverse reactions .,4
There were 461 respondents and the response rate was 100 % .,3
"Among these 461 patients with T2DM , 74.2 % refused insulin therapy .",3
The most common reason given for refusal was a lack of confidence in insulin injection ( 85.4 % ) .,3
"Multiple logistic regression revealed that respondents who had secondary education were 55.0 % less likely to refuse insulin therapy than those who had primary or no formal education ( p = 0.009 , adjusted odds ratio [ OR ] = 0.45 , 95 % confidence interval [ CI ] = 0.25-0 .82 ) .",3
"There was also a significant inverse association between glycated haemoglobin ( HbA1c ) and insulin therapy refusal ( p = 0.047 , adjusted OR = 0.87 , 95 % CI = 0.76-1 .00 ) .",3
Insulin therapy refusal is common in Kubang Pasu .,4
Education status and HbA1c should be taken into consideration when counselling patients on insulin therapy initiation .,4
"A significant time effect was observed for 1RM bench press ( p = 0.016 ) , leg press ( p = 0.012 ) , body mass ( p = 0.03 ) , fat-free mass ( p = 0.005 ) and total myofibrillar protein ( p = 0.005 ) .",3
A trend for larger muscle fiber cross-sectional area in the type II fibers compared to type I fibers was observed following the 12-week resistance training ( p = 0.08 ) .,3

Post-exercise ingestion of creatine monohydrate does not provide greater enhancement of body composition and muscle strength compared to resistance training alone in middle to older males .,4
"Among 63,397 eligible patients with unhealthy alcohol use , 25 % ( n = 2109 ) women and 28 % ( n = 15,199 ) men had documented AUD/SUD ( p < 0.001 ) .",3
"The prevalence of AUD/SUD increased with increasing AUDIT-C risk , ranging from 13 % ( 95 % CI 13-14 % ) to 82 % ( 79-85 % ) for women and 12 % ( 11-12 % ) to 69 % ( 68-71 % ) for men in the lowest and highest AUDIT-C risk groups , respectively .",3
Patterns were similar across age groups .,3
"One-quarter of all patients with unhealthy alcohol use , and a majority of those with the highest alcohol screening scores , had clinically recognized AUD/SUD .",4
Healthcare systems implementing evidence-based alcohol-related care should be prepared to offer more intensive interventions and/or effective pharmacotherapies for these patients .,4
One hundred and nineteen patients were randomized ( 39 GC and 80 GCI ) .,3
More GCI patients were male ( 80 % GCI and 67 % GC ) and had PS 0 ( 61 % GCI and 49 % GC ) .,3
"The ORR was 25.6 % [ 95 % confidence interval ( CI ) 13.0 % -42.1 % ] with GC versus 20.0 % ( 95 % CI 11.9 % -30.4 % ) with GCI , which did not allow rejection of the null hypothesis ( ORR with GCI 20 % ; P = 0.545 ) .",3
"Median PFS was 4.3 ( 95 % CI 2.8-5 .6 ) months with GC and 5.7 ( 95 % CI 4.6-6 .6 ) months with GCI ( hazard ratio 0.89 , 95 % CI 0.56-1 .40 ) .",3
"Median OS was 8.5 ( 95 % CI 5.5 to not reached ) months with GC , and 12.0 ( 95 % CI 8.9-17 .1 ) months with GCI ( hazard ratio 0.78 , 95 % CI 0.48-1 .27 ) .",3
More GCI patients received second-line treatment ( 51 % GC and 68 % GCI ) .,3
Toxicity was similar in the two arms .,3
"Grade 3-4 toxicities included asthenia ( 28 % GC and 8 % GCI ) , nausea ( 3 % GC and 14 % GCI ) , and decreased appetite ( 10 % in each ) .",3
Addition of iniparib to GC did not improve ORR over GC alone .,4
The GCI safety profile was comparable to GC alone .,4
Imbalances in PS and gender distribution may have impacted study results regarding PFS and OS .,4
The 2 treatment groups were demographically similar .,3
"Following the infant immunization series , anticapsular IgG antibody geometric mean concentrations and OPA geometric mean titers for each serotype were within 2-fold between the 2 groups .",3
Formal noninferiority criteria for comparison of proportion of responders ( subjects with IgG titers 0.35 g/mL ) were met for 11 of the 13 serotypes .,3
Overall population responses were highly similar .,3
Anticapsular IgG responses were also within 2-fold following the toddler dose .,3
Safety profiles were similar between the 2 groups .,3
Addition of P80 to PCV13 did not adversely affect PCV13 immunogenicity or safety when compared with vaccine formulated without P80 .,4
Increased intake of fatty fish had a significant ( p < 0.05 ) increasing effect on the amount of large HDL-lipoprotein subclasses and their lipids .,3
Frequent intake of fatty fish may have beneficial effects on HDL-metabolism beyond that assumed to be related to its serum concentrations .,4
"A total of 97 patients were randomized ( arm A/B , 47/50 ) , 70 of whom underwent esophagectomy ( arm A/B , 34/36 ) .",3
"The intention-to-treat pCR rate was 23.4 % ( 95 % confidence interval [ CI ] 11.2-35 .6 % ) in arm A and 38 % ( 95 % CI 24.5 % to 51.5 % ) in arm B. With a median follow-up duration of 30.3 months , the 2-year progression-free survival rate was 58.4 % in arm A and 58.6 % in arm B , whereas the 2-year overall survival rate was 60.7 % and 63.7 % , respectively .",3
Grade 3 or 4 thrombocytopenia during CCRT was more common in arm A than in arm B ( 35.4 % vs 4.1 % ) .,3
"The relative dose intensity of S1 ( 89.5 % 20.6 % vs 98.3 % 5.2 % , P = .005 ) and oxaliplatin ( 91.4 % 16.8 % vs 99.0 % 4.2 % , P = .007 ) during CCRT was lower in arm A compared with arm B. Three patients in arm A , compared with none in arm B , died within 90 days after surgery .",3
Combination chemotherapy of S1 and oxaliplatin is an effective chemoradiotherapy regimen to treat esophageal cancer .,4
"However , we failed to show that the addition of ICT to the regimen can improve the pCR rate .",4
"At week 4 , the mean increase in bowel movements/week was 2.6 ( SD + / -1.14 , 95 % CI :1.6 -3.6 ) in the L. reuteri group and 1.0 ( SD + / -1.95 % CI :0.12 -1.88 ) in the placebo group ( p = 0.046 ) .",3
"At the end of the treatment , the mean bowel movements/week was 5.28 + / -1.93 in the L. reuteri group and 3.89 + / -1.79 in the placebo group .",3
There was a not significant difference in the stool consistency between the two groups .,3
"L. reuteri is more effective than the placebo in improving bowel movement frequency in adult patients with functional constipation as previously demonstrated in children , even if it seems to have no effect on stool consistency .",4
"Trajectory group-based modeling identified groups of non - ( n = 297 , 61.2 % ) , gradual-moderate ( n = 135 , 27.8 % ) and rapid - ( n = 53 , 10.9 % ) responders .",3
"At baseline compared to non-responders , rapid-responders had consistently significantly ( p < .05 ) higher SANS total and subscale scores .",3
"Percent SANS improvement at endpoint was greatest for the rapid-responders group , a finding that replicated stratifying by placebo and amisulpride treatment groups .",3
"Similarly , in the total sample and stratifying by placebo and amisulpride groups , dropout was not significantly associated with trajectory group membership .",3
Trajectories of treatment response to the psychopharmacological medication of the negative symptoms of schizophrenia demonstrate substantial heterogeneity .,4
"Approximately half of the patients included in our analysis showed little improvement , and the most severely ill at baseline responded the most .",4
Complete caloric deprivation significantly decreased leptin but had no effect on fetuin-A levels .,3
Normalizing leptin levels with metreleptin in hypoleptinemic subjects had no effect on circulating fetuin-A levels .,3
Leptin treatment had no effect on fetuin-A mRNA expression and secretion in vitro .,3
Circulating fetuin-A levels are not affected by short and long-term energy deprivation .,4
"Furthermore , both in vivo and in vitro experiments confirm that fetuin-A is not regulated by leptin .",4
"The full analysis included 290 women ( FCM 144 , placebo 146 ) .",3
"Fatigue was reduced in 65.3 % ( FCM ) and 52.7 % ( placebo ) of patients ( OR 1.68 , 95 % CI 1.05-2 .70 ; p = 0.03 ) .",3
A 50 % reduction of PFS score was achieved in 33.3 % FCM - vs. 16.4 % placebo-treated patients ( p < 0.001 ) .,3
"At Day 56 , all FCM-treated patients had hemoglobin levels 120 g/L ( vs. 87 % at baseline ) ; with placebo , the proportion decreased from 86 % to 81 % .",3
Mental quality-of-life ( SF-12 ) and the cognitive function scores improved better with FCM .,3
` Power of attention ' improved better in FCM-treated patients with ferritin < 15 g/L .,3
"Treatment-emergent adverse events ( placebo 114 , FCM 209 ; most frequently headache , nasopharyngitis , pyrexia and nausea ) were mainly mild or moderate .",3
"A single infusion of FCM improved fatigue , mental quality-of-life , cognitive function and erythropoiesis in iron-deficient women with normal or borderline hemoglobin .",4
"Although more side effects were reported compared to placebo , FCM can be an effective alternative in patients who can not tolerate or use oral iron , the common treatment of iron deficiency .",4
"Overall , the results support the hypothesis that iron deficiency can affect women 's health , and a normal iron status should be maintained independent of hemoglobin levels .",4
Both the CROS and BAHD significantly reduced the head shadow effect .,3
"QuickSIN scores were significantly better with noise presented to the poorer ear , as compared to the better ear , for the unaided condition , the BAHD , and the CROS .",3
"Scores showed no significant differences between the CROS and BAHD with noise presented to the better ear , but scores with the CROS were significantly poorer than in the unaided condition with noise presented to the poorer ear .",3
There were no significant differences between BAHD and CROS for the ratings on the Bern Benefit in Single-Sided Deafness and Speech Spatial Qualities questionnaires .,3
Both devices were worn an average of 10 hours per day .,3
Four participants preferred the CROS for sound quality ; three preferred the BAHD for comfort .,3
Comparisons of CROS and BAHD need to be re-evaluated as both technologies have evolved .,4
"In our pilot study , both devices seem comparable , with the CROS avoiding the risks of surgery , and we recommend a trial of CROS in our center for first line treatment of single-sided deafness .",4
"After red-light-PDT , IPL-PDT and IPL treatment , the appearance of photoaging lesion was improved .",3
"The SC hydration , L ( * ) value , elasticity and thickness increased , whereas the TEWL and MI value decreased .",3
These changes in red-light-PDT and IPL-PDT group were more obvious than IPL group .,3
The a ( * ) and EI value increased in red-light-PDT group .,3
No significant change was noticed in red-light group .,3
Partial irradiation of the thyroid did not affect the function and volume of the thyroid .,3
IPL-PDT and red-light-PDT showed better rejuvenation effect than IPL or red light alone on the neck skin .,4
"This study protocol presents the design of a RCT for evaluating the effectiveness of a web-based treatment program using intensive therapeutic support for female patients with bulimia nervosa , binge eating disorder and eating disorders not otherwise specified .",4
A total of 120 sessions of ECT were administered to 12 patients .,3
Heart rate was higher in the sevoflurane group than the propofol group .,3
"Compared with the sevoflurane group , bispectral index level was lower in the propofol group during the induction period and higher during the recovery period .",3
"Anaesthetic induction and recovery times were lower , and average motor and EEG convulsion activity was longer , in the propofol group than in the sevoflurane group .",3
"Propofol/remifentanil is more successful compared with sevoflurane/remifentanil in anaesthesia management during ECT since it provides quick induction and recovery , longer seizure activity and stable haemodynamics .",4
Average time in sleep stage 1 decreased from NT1 to NT10 irrespective of trial .,3
Overall incidence and time spent in periodic breathing increased from NT1 to NT10 in both HAMB and HBR .,3
"During NT1 , both HAMB and HBR reduced slow-wave sleep and increased light sleep , whereas NBR and HBR increased the number of awakenings/night .",3
There were fewer awakenings during HAMB than NBR .,3
"Acute exposure to both hypoxia and bedrest ( HBR ) results in greater sleep fragmentation due to more awakenings attributed to bedrest , and lighter sleep as a result of reduced slow wave sleep caused by the hypoxic environment .",4
Application of loperamide HCl in a liposomal gel formulation exerted analgesic and anti-inflammatory effects exclusively in peripheral painful inflamed tissue .,3
This formulation produced highly significant analgesic and anti-inflammatory effects over the 48-hour time course studied following topical administration in rats with CFA-induced inflammation of the paw .,3
"As expected , the diclofenac gel group showed significant antinociception over the duration of the study ; however , this effect was lower in comparison to the loperamide HCl liposomal gel formulation .",3
All other control groups showed no significant antinociceptive effects .,3
"In addition , all control groups ( 1 % diclofenac gel , free loperamide gel , and empty liposomal gel ) did not demonstrate a significant change in paw volume over 48 hours .",3
In vivo studies were performed in the well-established rodent model of acute inflammatory pain .,4
We are currently studying this approach in chronic pain models known to have clinical activation of the peripheral immune-derived opioid response .,4
The study demonstrates that topically applied loperamide encapsulated within liposomal systems has improved therapeutic efficacy over conventional formulations for the local treatment of acute peripheral inflammatory pain conditions where the skin has remained intact .,4
"Once in the inflamed peripheral tissue , loperamide provides analgesic and anti-inflammatory effects in a similar manner to peripheral endogenous opioids .",4
This preparation optimises the retention of drug at the site where action is required .,4
Twenty patients completed the study .,3
"RIPC was not associated with improvements in peak VO2 ( 15.6 + / -4.2 vs 15.3 + / -4.6 mL/kg/min ; p = 0.53 , sham and RIPC , respectively ) .",3
"In our Langendorff sub-study , infarct size was similar between RIPC and sham dialysate groups from our study patients , but was smaller than expected compared to healthy controls ( 29.0 % , 27.9 % [ sham , RIPC ] vs 51.2 % [ controls ] .",3
We observed less preconditioning among the subgroup of patients with increased exercise performance following RIPC ( p < 0.04 ) .,3
"In this pilot study of RIPC in heart failure patients , RIPC was not associated with improvements in exercise capacity overall .",4
"However , the degree of effect of RIPC may be inversely related to the degree of baseline preconditioning .",4
These data provide the basis for a larger randomized trial to test the potential benefits of RIPC in patients with heart failure .,4
MCID cut-offs were below a QMGS change of 3.0 .,3
"Anchor-based and 1 SEM cut-offs showed 58.3 % vs. 30.7 % responders ( P = 0.017 ) , SD 54.2 % vs. 19.2 % responders ( P = 0.018 ) , and effect size 0.519 vs. 0.164 ( P = 0.011 ) in IVIg vs. placebo .",3
Anchor-based ( P = 0.73 ) and effect-size ( P = 0.41 ) MCID cut-offs did not show a difference between IVIg and placebo .,3
MCID methods did not produce meaningful RNS cut-offs .,3
QMGS MCID values provide clinically relevant information and are recommended in MG trials .,4
MCID analysis shows that improvement in MG patients treated with IVIg reflects clinically meaningful changes .,4
The percentage of hepatic fat increased exponentially with blood glucose .,3
SUVmax / SUVLV and fat-adjusted SUVave / SUVLV but not SUVave / SUVLV correlated with blood glucose .,3
Fat-adjusted SUVave was higher in patients with hepatic steatosis ( p < 0.001 ) by ~ 0.4 in all blood glucose groups .,3
There was a similar difference ( ~ 0.3 ) in SUVmax ( p < 0.005 ) but no difference in SUVave .,3
SUVmax / SUVLV and fat-adjusted SUVave / SUVLV correlated with blood glucose in patients with hepatic steatosis but not in those without .,3
SUVave / SUVLV correlated with blood glucose in neither group .,3
"FDG uptake is increased in hepatic steatosis , probably resulting from irreversible uptake in inflammatory cells superimposed on reversible hepatocyte uptake .",4
Two hundred patients with a total number of 543 AKs were enrolled .,3
The CR rates of lesions after 3months were 782 % with cryotherapy and 724 % with CO2 laser ablation .,3
Thicker lesions were significantly more responsive to cryotherapy ( P = 0034 ) .,3
Seventy-three patients ( 716 % ) had CR of all lesions 3months after cryotherapy and 64 ( 653 % ) after laser ablation .,3
At 12months after treatment the number of patients with CR was reduced to 53 with cryotherapy and 14 with laser ablation .,3
"The rate of patients and lesions with CR is similar after 3months , but more patients remain in stable remission for 12months after cryotherapy .",4
Cryotherapy is more effective for thick lesions .,4
The cosmetic outcome was good or excellent in almost all patients .,4
"Observations were conducted for 1,149 elementary and 427 intermediate students .",3
"Compared with students in the control schools , significantly more intervention elementary and intermediate school students selected total ( P < 0.001 , P < 0.05 ) and starchy vegetables ( P < 0.001 , P < 0.01 ) ; more intervention intermediate school students selected fruit ( P < 0.001 ) , legumes ( P < 0.05 ) , and protein foods ( P < 0.01 ) .",3
"There were significantly greater amounts of these foods selected and consumed , but no differences in the proportion of the foods consumed by condition .",3
Fewer calories were consumed by elementary and intermediate school intervention students .,3
More intervention students selected fruit and vegetables at lunch and consumed them compared with control condition students .,4
Future studies with larger and more diverse student populations are warranted .,4
"A sizeable proportion ( n = 322 , 17.9 % ) of patients had changing smoking status during 5-year follow-up .",3
One in 5 patients with complex CAD was smoking at baseline .,3
"However , 60 % stopped after revascularization while others continued to smoke .",3
Smokers had worse clinical outcomes due to a higher incidence of recurrent MI in both revascularization arms .,3
Smoking was an independent predictor of the composite endpoint of death/MI/stroke ( hazard ratio [ HR ] : 1.8 ; 95 % confidence interval [ CI ] : 1.3 to 2.5 ; p = 0.001 ) and MACCE ( HR : 1.4 ; 95 % CI : 1.1 to 1.7 ; p = 0.02 ) .,3
Smoking is associated with poor clinical outcomes after revascularization in patients with complex CAD .,4
This places further emphasis on efforts at smoking cessation to improve revascularization benefits .,4
( SYNTAX Study : TAXUS Drug-Eluting Stent Versus Coronary Artery Bypass Surgery for the Treatment of Narrowed Arteries ; NCT00114972 ) .,4
The study was placed on clinical hold after randomization of 336 patients when a safety review indicated an imbalance of possibly drug-related deaths in the tasisulam arm .,3
"Efficacy results for tasisulam versus paclitaxel revealed a response rate of 3.0 % versus 4.8 % , a median progression-free survival of 1.94 months versus 2.14 months ( P = .048 ) , and a median overall survival of 6.77 months versus 9.36 months ( P = .121 ) .",3
The most common drug-related grade 3 laboratory toxicities ( graded according to Common Terminology for Adverse Events [ version 3.0 ] ) were thrombocytopenia ( 18.9 % ) for patients treated with tasisulam and neutropenia/leukopenia ( 8.7 % ) among those receiving paclitaxel .,3
"There were 13 possibly related deaths reported to occur on the study , with the majority occurring during cycle 2 in the setting of grade 4 myelosuppression , all in the tasisulam arm .",3
"Investigation of the unexpectedly high rate of hematologic toxicity revealed a subset of patients with low tasisulam clearance , leading to drug accumulation and high albumin-corrected exposure in cycle 2 .",3
"Although the study was stopped early because of safety issues in the tasisulam arm , tasisulam was considered unlikely to be superior to paclitaxel , and paclitaxel activity in the second-line treatment of melanoma was much lower than expected .",4
"The toxicity imbalance was attributed to an unexpectedly low tasisulam clearance in a subset of patients , underscoring the importance of pharmacokinetic monitoring of compounds with complex dosing , even in late-phase studies .",4
"In both groups , HR , MAP , COR , and E at T2 were lower than at T0 significantly ( P < 0.05 ) .",3
beta-EP in group C at T2 was lower than at T0 significantly ( P < 0.05 ) .,3

beta-EP in group T at T1 and T3 were higher than at T0 significantly ( P < 0.05 ) .,3
"HR , COR , E , Glu , and beta-EP in group T at T4 and T5 were higher than at T0 significantly ( P < 0.05 ) .",3
"Between groups , comparing with the time point T0 , the amplitude of variation of MAP , COR , and E at T2 in group C were significantly less ( P < 0.05 ) ; the amplitude of variation of HR , MAP , and COR at T3 in group C were less significantly , when compared with the time point T0 ( P < 0.05 ) ; the amplitude of variation of HR , MAP , COR , E , and Glu at T4 and T5 in group C were less significantly , when compared with the time point T0 ( P < 0.05 ) .",3
"When comparing the two groups , the amplitude of variation of beta-EP at time points of T1 , T3 , T4 , and T5 in group T were larger than at T0 in group C ( P < 0.05 ) .",3
TAES could reduce stress and stabilize the internal environment when used in brain surgery with propofol TCI general anesthesia .,4
"After a median follow-up of > 10 years , the estimated adjusted hazards ratio of the QUAD versus QU treatment arms for OS was 1.09 ( 95 % confidence interval , 0.59-2 .00 ; P = .783 ) and was 1.04 ( 95 % confidence interval , 0.56-1 .94 ; P = .898 ) for DFS .",3
"Of the 245 patients in the QU treatment arm , 22 ( 9.0 % ) experienced axillary lymph node recurrence .",3
"The median time to axillary lymph node recurrence from breast surgery was 30.0 months ( interquartile range , 24.2 months-73 .4 months ) .",3
Patients with T1N0 breast cancer did not appear to benefit in terms of DFS and OS from immediate axillary lymph node dissection in the current randomized trial .,4
The biological characteristics of the primary tumor appear adequate for guiding adjuvant treatment .,4
Sensory and motor block durations were longer in group LD as compared to L ( P < 0.01 ) .,3
Duration of analgesia was significantly longer in group LD as compared to group L ( p < 0.05 ) .,3
Dexmedetomidine added to levobupivacaine in supraclavicular brachial plexus block prolongs the duration of block and the duration of postoperative analgesia .,4
"In comparison with the Sham group , a significant decrease was found in the OVX group in such indices as trabecular bone volume/total tissue area ( BV/TV ) , trabecular number ( Tb.N ) and trabecular thickness ( Tb.Th ) .",3
"1,25 ( OH ) Dand DES partly prevented the decrease in BV/TV , Tb.N , Tb.Th in OVX mice .",3
"Treg cell number , Foxp3 mRNA expression in spleen and Foxp3 protein expression in femur significantly decreased in the OVX-treated group compared with those in the sham group .",3
"1,25 ( OH ) 2Dand DES significantly increased Treg cell number and Foxp3 expression .",3
Treg cells and Foxp3 gene expression were related to bone histomorphometric parameters .,3
The decrease in Treg cell numbers is relevant to the postmenopausal osteoporosis .,4
"The antiosteoporosis of 1,25 ( OH ) Dis related to regulatory T cells .",4
"The levels of sedation ( Observer 's Assessment of Alertness/Sedation scales ) and anxiety ( visual analog score ) at pre-induction , and the times to eye-opening and extubation , were not different between the groups .",3
"The heart rate response following tracheal intubation and extubation , and mean arterial pressure responses after extubation , were attenuated in the dexmedetomidine group compared to the midazolam group .",3
No bradycardia or hypotension was noted in any patients .,3
"Propofol target concentrations at intubation and at start and completion of surgery were decreased in the dexmedetomidine group , whereas no difference in respective remifentanil levels was detected .",3
This study provides further evidence that dexmedetomidine premedication in low dose ( 1 gkg-1 ) by intramuscular route can induce preoperative sedation and adjuvant anaesthetic effects without clinically significant bradycardia or hypotension .,4
The frequency of epistaxis was significantly lower in Group R than Group L ( P = 0.0006 ) .,3
"Although there was no significant difference in nasal passage time between two groups , the intubation time in Group R ( 24.5 9.4 sec ) was shorter than in Group L ( 30.5 15.6 sec ; P = 0.0015 ) .",3
Nasal intubation via the right nostril is more safely performed than with the left nostril .,4
Because of less epistaxis and faster intubation .,4
A 2-arm randomized trial was conducted over 52 weeks among primary care clinicians at 8 hospitals .,3
Educational content consisted of 32 validated multiple-choice questions with explanations on hypertension management .,3
"Providers were randomized into 2 groups : SE clinicians were enrolled in the game , whereas control clinicians received identical educational content in an online posting .",3
SE game clinicians were e-mailed 1 question every 3 days .,3
"Adaptive game mechanics resent questions in 12 or 24 days if answered incorrectly or correctly , respectively .",3
Clinicians retired questions by answering each correctly twice consecutively .,3
Posting of relative performance among peers fostered competition .,3
Primary outcome measure was time to BP target ( < 140/90 mm Hg ) .,3
One hundred eleven clinicians enrolled .,3
"The SE game was completed by 87 % of clinicians ( 48/55 ) , whereas 84 % of control clinicians ( 47/56 ) read the online posting .",3
"In multivariable analysis of 17 866 hypertensive periods among 14 336 patients , the hazard ratio for time to BP target in the SE game cohort was 1.043 ( 95 % confidence interval , 1.007-1 .081 ; P = 0.018 ) .",3
The number of hypertensive episodes needed to treat to normalize one additional patient 's BP was 67.8 .,3
The number of clinicians needed to teach to achieve this was 0.43 .,3
An online SE game among clinicians generated a modest but significant reduction in the time to BP target among their hypertensive patients .,4
The overall response rate was 22.0 % .,3
"Significant main effects showed higher response rates for the use of prenotification ( present = 23.6 % ; absent = 20.3 % ) , among female participants , and older participants .",3
A significant interaction of teaser by gender indicated lower response rates for men who received the teaser but not for women .,3
Older participants returned the questionnaire more promptly than younger participants .,3
Females-but not males-who received the teaser were slower to return the questionnaire .,3
"Higher response rates for participants receiving the postcard compensated for increased costs , particularly for males and older participants .",3
Response rates to a mental health postal survey can be increased through the use of prenotification .,4
"Treatment with atorvastatin 40mg/d significantly increased circulating EPC ( p = 0.002 ) , FMD ( p = 0.001 ) and reduced TNF - ( p = 0.01 ) compared to baseline .",3
"Similarly , treatment with atorvastatin 10mg/day increased circulating EPC ( p = 0.01 ) , FMD ( p = 0.08 ) and reduced TNF - ( p = 0.01 ) compared to baseline .",3
"Interestingly , with 40mg/day atorvastatin treatment the increase in EPC was higher in subjects categorized as NYHA class II compared to subjects categorized as NYHA class III ( p = 0.03 ) .",3
Our results confirmed the distinct impact of atorvastatin treatment on the restoration of endothelial function due to EPC mobilization in ischemic HF subjects .,4
"Moreover , these findings provide the potential clinical significance of EPC status monitoring to individualize treatment in HF subjects .",4
"During the median 28years of follow-up , three patients developed ischaemic foot ulcers in the ICT group compared with ten in the ST group ( logrank , p = 0.035 ) .",3
"At the time of iontophoresis , HbA1c was lower in the ICT group ( median 57mmol/mol [ minimum-maximum 40-79mmol / mol ] ) compared with the ST group ( 68mmol/mol [ 41-96mmol / mol ] , p < 0.01 ) ( DCCT : ICT 7.4 % [ 5.8-9 .4 % ] vs ST 8.4 % [ 5.9-10 .9 % ] ) .",3
"Stimulated blood flow was higher in the ICT vs ST group with significantly increased perfusion units ( PU ) for : ACh ( 8.1 PU [ 4.6-24 .7 PU ] vs 5.3 PU [ 1.7-21 .4 PU ] , p < 0.01 ) ; SNP ( 8.1 PU [ 2.2-20 .1 PU ] vs 5.6 PU [ 2.3-19 .2 PU ] , p = 0.03 ) ; and capsaicin ( 5.0 PU [ 1.7-22 .9 PU ] vs 3.4 PU [ 1.5-8 .4 PU ] , p < 0.01 ) .",3
"HbA1c was associated with vasodilatation induced by ACh ( b = -0.02 , p < 0.01 ) and capsaicin ( b = -0.02 , p = 0.03 ) .",3
"HbA1c was independently associated with ACh ( b = -1.48 , p < 0.01 ) and capsaicin-induced vasodilatation ( b = -1.45 , p < 0.01 ) .",3
Improved glycaemic control in patients with type 1 diabetes is associated with an improvement in skin microcirculation and with a lower incidence of ischaemic foot ulcers .,4
The STRE group was more effective to strength gain for all muscles and pain control after 4 and 16 weeks ( p < 0.05 ) .,3
The FLEX group showed higher improvements in anxiety ( p < 0.05 ) .,3
"Both groups showed improvements in the QOL , and there was no significant difference observed between the groups .",3
There was no change in the HRV of the STRE and FLEX groups .,3
Strengthening exercises show greater and more rapid improvements in pain and strength than flexibility exercises .,4
"Despite the benefits in fitness , pain , depression , anxiety and quality of life , no effect was observed on the autonomic modulation in both groups .",4
This observation suggests that changes in autonomic modulation are not a target tobe clinically achieved in fibromyalgia .,4
A total of 178 of 210 ( 84.7 % ) patients were available for at least 9-year radiological and clinical follow-up data : 85.3 % ( 87/102 ) patients in group A and 84.3 % ( 91/108 ) patients in group B. Bone fusion was achieved in all patients at the last follow-up .,3
ASD was proven in 110 ( 61.8 % ) of 178 patients .,3
"The incidences of radiographical and symptomatic ASD were 57.9 % ( 103/178 ) and 3.9 % ( 7/178 ) , respectively .",3
"The incidence of ASD in group B was significantly lower than that in group A. Results of clinical outcomes showed lower visual analogue scale and Oswestry Disability Index scores in 2 groups than preoperative scores , but group B had greater improvement on the Oswestry Disability Index scores than group A in patients with ASD .",3
The degeneration of superior adjacent segment is closely related to the position of the pedicle screws during lumbar fusion surgery .,4
The position of the pedicle screw farther from the facet joint surface can reduce the degeneration of superior adjacent segment .,4
The CDAI scores of both the treatment and control groups were significantly reduced after treatment compared with those measured before treatment .,3
"However , the degree of improvement in the treatment group was significantly greater than that of the control group .",3
"The improvement in symptoms in patients of the treatment group was sustained at follow-up , whereas that of the control group was not .",3
The overall efficacy of the treatment was significantly greater than that of the control .,3
"Both groups demonstrated significant improvements in quality-of-life ratings after treatment , but the improvement was significantly greater in the treatment group than in the control group .",3
"In addition , the patients in the treatment group showed significantly increased HGB and significantly decreased CRP levels and histopathological scores at the end of treatment , whereas the control group did not exhibit significant changes .",3
Moxibustion with acupuncture provided significant therapeutic benefits in patients with active CD beyond the placebo effect and is therefore an effective and safe treatment for active CD .,4
"After the start of extracorporeal circulation and aortic cross-clamping ( T2 ) , both groups showed a significant drop in FCD , but with a significantly higher FCD in the MECC group ( 153.1 15.0 cm/cm in the CECC group vs 160.8 12.2 cm/cm in the MECC group , P = 0.034 ) .",3
"During the late phase of the cardiopulmonary bypass ( CPB ) ( T3 ) , the FCD was still significantly depressed in both treatment groups ( 153.5 14.6 cm/cm in the CECC group , P < 0.05 vs ` T1 ' ; 159.5 12.4 cm/cm in the MECC group , P < 0.05 versus ` T1 ' ) .",3
"After termination of CPB ( T4 ) , the FCD recovered in both groups to baseline values .",3
"Microvascular blood flow velocity tended to remain at a higher level in the MECC group , whereas haemodilution during CPB was significantly reduced in the MECC group .",3
"The use of MECC in AVR did not affect procedural safety and , resulted in beneficial preservation of microvascular blood flow velocity and significantly reduced haemodilution during CPB .",4
"In contrast to CABG surgery , the use of MECC did not improve FCD during surgical AVR .",4
Clinical advantages possibly resulting from attenuated haemodilution and preservation of microvascular blood flow velocity require further validation in larger patient cohorts .,4
A total of 134 students participated ( 62 trained using a PS ; 72 using an LM ) .,3
Mean overall test scores were 56 % for the PS group and 69 % for the LM group ( P = .001 ) .,3
"A significant difference was identified in scanning technique ( PS , 60 % versus LM , 73 % ; P = .001 ) and image acquisition ( PS , 37 % versus LM , 59 % ; P = .001 ) .",3
None was observed for professionalism .,3
"The PS group rated their training experience at 4.4 , whereas the LM group rated theirs at 6.2 ( P < .001 ) .",3
"Simulators do not perform as well as LMs for training novices in TVS , but they may be useful as an adjunct to LM training .",4
"Generalized linear models confirmed that , beyond actual treatment assignment , treatment guess improved model fit for both self-report and behavioral smoking-related measures .",3
"Further , accuracy of treatment guess improved from titration to full dosage , and specific demographic factors ( e.g. , gender , race ) were associated with type of treatment guess and guess stability across time .",3
These results reinforce the importance of assessing perceived treatment assignment repeatedly during placebo-controlled trials and suggest that treatment expectancies during titration can affect outcomes once full dosage has been reached .,4
"Initial results were obtained in 6 trials with 1,839 participants .",3
"Nominally statistically significant associations of 2 SLC22A2 polymorphisms were observed : ( 1 ) with rs316019 at 6 months , overall ( [ c. 808T > G ; p.Ser270Ala ] , OR = 1.306 , 95 % CI = 1.034-1 .649 , p = .025 ) , and among those randomized to nicotine replacement therapy ( NRT ) ( OR = 1.784 , 95 % CI = 1.072-2 .970 , p = .026 ) ; and ( 2 ) with rs316006 ( c.1502-529A > T ) among those randomized to varenicline ( OR = 1.420 , 95 % CI = 1.038-1 .944 , p = .028 , OR = 1.362 , 95 % CI = 1.001-1 .853 , p = .04 ) at end of treatment and 6 months .",3
"Individuals randomized to NRT from a seventh trial were genotyped for rs316019 ; rs316019 was associated with a nominally statistically significant effect on abstinence overall at 6 months among 2,233 participants ( OR = 1.249 , 95 % CI = 1.007-1 .550 , p = .043 ) .",3
"The functional OCT2 Ser270Ala polymorphism is nominally statistically significantly associated with abstinence among European-ancestry treatment-seeking smokers after adjustments for pharmacotherapy , demographics , population genetics , and without adjustment for multiple testing of 7 SNPs .",4
Replication of these preliminary findings in additional randomized controlled trials of smoking cessation therapies and from multiple continental populations would describe another pharmacogenetic role for SLC22A2/OCT2 .,4
Preliminary data revealed VFE and PhoRTE groups demonstrated a significant improvement in V-RQOL scores .,3
"However , only PhoRTE demonstrated a significant reduction in PPE , as suggested by the study 's causal model .",3
The CTL group did not demonstrate significant changes .,3
"Numerically , VFE registered slightly greater adherence to home practice recommendations than did PhoRTE , but PhoRTE perceived greater treatment satisfaction than VFE .",3
Findings provide new evidence regarding the efficacy of voice therapy exercises in the treatment of age-related dysphonia and suggest PhoRTE therapy as another treatment method for improved voice-related quality of life and reduced perceived vocal effort in this population .,4
Antibody titers increased in both leptospiral-vaccinated groups of calves .,3
A significant increase in antibody titers against L borgpetersenii serovar Hardjo was detected after administration of the second dose of L borgpetersenii serovar Hardjo bacterin and challenge exposure .,3
"In 10 of 11 adjuvant-treated control calves , serovar Hardjo was isolated from both urine and kidney samples .",3
Leptospira borgpetersenii serovar Hardjo was not isolated from the urine or kidney samples obtained from any of the 21 remaining calves that received 1 dose of bacterin or the 20 remaining calves that received 2 doses of bacterin .,3
Protection in young calves was induced by vaccination with 1 or 2 doses of a serovar Hardjo bacterin .,4
Linemen with stronger lateral flexors and composite cervical strength had about 1.75 times ' increased odds of sustaining moderate linear head impacts rather than mild impacts compared with weaker linemen .,3
"Players who developed extensor torque more quickly had 2 times the increased odds of sustaining severe linear head impacts ( odds ratio [ OR ] , 2.10 ; 95 % CI , 1.08-4 .05 ) rather than mild head impacts .",3
"However , players with greater cervical stiffness had reduced odds of sustaining both moderate ( OR , 0.77 ; 95 % CI , 0.61-0 .96 ) and severe ( OR , 0.64 ; 95 % CI , 0.46-0 .89 ) head impacts compared with players with less cervical stiffness .",3
"The study findings showed that greater cervical stiffness and less angular displacement after perturbation reduced the odds of sustaining higher magnitude head impacts ; however , the findings did not show that players with stronger and larger neck muscles mitigate head impact severity .",4
"Fifty-one patients , 19 with abscesses and 32 with infiltrates , were evaluated .",3
"Overall , the radiographical lesion areas ranged from 0.4-46 .2 mm ( 2 ) ( median = 9 mm ( 2 ) ) .",3
"An increased risk ( risk ratio > 1 ) to occur at large abscess lesions was observed for Prevotella ( P. ) oralis , P. buccae , P. oris , P. intermedia , Fusobacterium nucleatum and Streptococcus ( Strep . )",3

"At baseline , FAO + versus FAO - patients were more likely male and had longer asthma duration and worse pulmonary function .",3
"During the treatment period , lung function and asthma control measures with placebo were generally worse in FAO + versus FAO - patients .",3
Budesonide was effective on most end points in both FAO + and FAO - patients .,3
"In contrast to FAO - patients , FAO + patients were unresponsive to formoterol monotherapy in both study populations .",3
"Consistently greater improvements in most end points ( including worsening of asthma as predefined by specific lung function parameters or clinical symptoms ) were observed moving from formoterol to budesonide to budesonide/formoterol in both FAO + and FAO - patients , with generally greater than additive effects on lung function with budesonide/formoterol in FAO + patients .",3
FAO + patients tended to be more impaired and at greater risk for an asthma event versus FAO - patients .,4
"While FAO + patients were non-responsive to formoterol monotherapy , they retained responsiveness to budesonide and had the greatest lung function and control responses to budesonide/formoterol that were similar to or greater than responses of FAO - patients .",4
"Prostaglandin E2 , platelet-derived growth factor ( PDGF ) AA , eotaxin , vascular endothelial growth factor , interferon - inducible protein of 10 kDa , monocyte chemoattractant protein 1 , growth-related oncogene , interleukin 6 , interleukin 8 ( IL-8 ) , and tumor necrosis factor were detectable in the aqueous and vitreous of at least half of the eyes , and these cytokines were analyzed further .",3
"Aqueous levels were lower in the ketorolac group for all cytokines detected , but only the difference in IL-8 was statistically significant ( 52 % reduction ; P = .04 ) .",3
Levels of IL-8 ( 41 % reduction ; P = .002 ) and PDGF-AA ( 21 % reduction ; P = .009 ) were significantly lower in the vitreous of patients treated with ketorolac .,3
"Topical ketorolac tromethamine , 0.45 % , significantly lowered aqueous IL-8 levels and vitreous IL-8 and PDGF-AA levels in this series of eyes , suggesting that it may cause meaningful inhibition of inflammatory cytokines implicated in the pathogenesis of DR.",4
"Mean ( SD ) age and weight of participants was 14.2 years ( 1.7 ) and 69 kg ( 14.5 ) , respectively .",3
"Serum vitamin C levels tended to increase during the DASH phase compared with the UDA phase ( 16.8 12.9 vs. -13.8 9.7 ng/dl , respectively , p = 0.06 ) indicating a relatively good compliance to the DASH diet .",3
"Adherence to the DASH diet , compared to the UDA , had a significant effect on serum high-sensitivity C-reactive protein levels ( p = 0.002 ) .",3
This effect remained significant even after adjustment for weight changes and after further controlling for changes in lipid profiles .,3
"We did not observe any significant effect of intervention on levels of serum tumor necrosis factor-alpha , interleukin ( IL ) -2 , IL-6 and adiponectin , in either the crude or adjusted models .",3
"There were no significant group * time interactions for any dependent variable , except for IL-6 ; this was close to the significant level .",3
"In summary , consumption of the DASH eating pattern for 6 weeks may reduce circulating levels of hs-CRP among adolescents with MetS .",4
Other inflammatory markers were not affected by the DASH diet .,4
"At a median follow-up of 49.2 months ( IQR 47.0-51 .8 ) , 741 ( 96 % ) of the prespecified 773 death events for the final analysis had been observed : 354 ( 65 % ) of 546 patients in the abiraterone acetate group and 387 ( 71 % ) of 542 in the placebo group .",3
238 ( 44 % ) patients initially receiving prednisone alone subsequently received abiraterone acetate plus prednisone as crossover per protocol ( 93 patients ) or as subsequent therapy ( 145 patients ) .,3
"Overall , 365 ( 67 % ) patients in the abiraterone acetate group and 435 ( 80 % ) in the placebo group received subsequent treatment with one or more approved agents .",3
Median overall survival was significantly longer in the abiraterone acetate group than in the placebo group ( 34.7 months [ 95 % CI 32.7-36 .8 ] vs 30.3 months [ 28.7-33 .3 ] ; hazard ratio 0.81 [ 95 % CI 0.70-0 .93 ] ; p = 0.0033 ) .,3
"The most common grade 3-4 adverse events of special interest were cardiac disorders ( 41 [ 8 % ] of 542 patients in the abiraterone acetate group vs 20 [ 4 % ] of 540 patients in the placebo group ) , increased alanine aminotransferase ( 32 [ 6 % ] vs four [ < 1 % ] ) , and hypertension ( 25 [ 5 % ] vs 17 [ 3 % ] ) .",3
"In this randomised phase 3 trial with a median follow-up of more than 4 years , treatment with abiraterone acetate prolonged overall survival compared with prednisone alone by a margin that was both clinically and statistically significant .",4
These results further support the favourable safety profile of abiraterone acetate in patients with chemotherapy-naive metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer .,4
"Because of the study design , blinding of the participants and the therapists involved in the study will not be possible .",4
The results of this study could contribute to the process of clinical decision - making for the improvement of pain and disability in participants with nonspecific chronic low back pain .,4
"( 1 ) Exercise tolerance : the differences of 6-MWD and exercise time were statistically significant between groups , which were more superior in the treatment group ( both P < 0.01 ) ; the VO2max was significantly increased after treatment in the treatment group ( P < 0.05 ) , but there was no difference between two groups ( P > 0.05 ) .",3
"( 2 ) Pulmonary ventilation function : the differences of FEV1 % , FEV1/FVC and MVV % were statistically significant between groups , which were more superior in the treatment group ( P < 0.05 , P < 0.01 ) ; ( 3 ) SGRQ : the SGRQ was significantly improved after treatment in the treatment group ( P < 0.05 ) , but there was no difference between two groups ( P > 0.05 ) .",3
"The acupuncture could improve the exercise tolerance in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease at stable phase , and shorten the onset time of aerobic exercise .",4
"Besides , acupuncture combined with aerobic exercise could effectively improve the pulmonary function .",4
"The training data of the group that received force feedback showed a learning curve for the mean and max absolute force , max force area , force volume , task time , and path length of both instruments .",3
"The data from the group that received time feedback showed a learning curve for the max force , task time , and path length of both instruments .",3
"In the posttest , the parameters of mean absolute force ( p = 0.039 ) , max force ( p = 0.041 ) , and force volume ( p = 0.009 ) showed a significant difference in favor of the group that received force feedback .",3
The learning curves and the posttest indicate that training with visual force feedback improves tissue handling skills with no negative effect on the task time and instrument motions .,4
"Conventional laparoscopic training with visual time feedback improves instrument motion and task time , but it does not improve tissue manipulation skills .",4
2596 women were included .,3
"BMI ( kg/m ( 2 ) ) groups were < 25 ( 29.5 % ) , 25-30 ( 28.2 % ) , 30-35 ( 21 % ) , 35-40 ( 10.9 % ) , and 40 ( 10.4 % ) .",3
"Stage ( p = 0.021 ) , grade ( p < 0.001 ) , and histology ( p = 0.005 ) differed by BMI .",3
Obese women were less likely to have high risk ( HR ) disease ( + lymph nodes/ovaries/cytology ) or tumor features that met GOG99 high intermediate risk ( HIR ) criteria ( p < 0.001 ) .,3
Adjuvant therapy ( p = 0.151 ) and recurrence ( p = 0.46 ) did not vary by BMI .,3
"Hospitalization > 2days , antibiotic use , wound infection , and venous thrombophlebitis were higher with BMI 40 .",3
"BMI ( p = 0.016 ) , age ( p < 0.0001 ) , race ( p = 0.033 ) , and risk group ( p < 0.0001 ) predicted all-cause mortality .",3
"BMI was not predictive of disease-specific survival ( p = 0.79 ) , but age ( p = 0.032 ) and risk group ( p < 0.0001 ) were significant factors .",3
Obese women have greater surgical risk and lower risk of metastatic disease .,4
"BMI is associated with all-cause but not disease-specific mortality , emphasizing the detrimental effect of obesity ( independent of EC ) , which deserves particular attention .",4
One hundred and twenty patients with clinical features suggestive of microsporidial superficial keratoconjunctivitis were included in the study .,3
The mean age was 34.3 13.6 years ( Group 1 ) and 35.8 16.2 years ( Group 2 ) ( P = .59 ) .,3
The mean duration of symptoms was 6.8 3.9 days ( Group 1 ) and 7.2 4.6 days ( Group 2 ) ( P = .61 ) .,3
Baseline characteristics showed no difference between the 2 groups .,3
"The primary outcome was the time from the presentation to complete resolution ( ie , absence of corneal lesions ) of the clinical signs and symptoms .",3
"The secondary outcomes were final visual acuity and residual corneal side effects and/or scarring , if any .",3
The mean resolution time of the corneal lesions was 5.7 4.0 days ( Group 1 ) and 5.9 3.9 days ( Group 2 ) ( P = .83 ) .,3
There was no significant difference in final visual outcome in the 2 groups .,3
No serious side effects were observed .,3
Debridement does not have any significant advantage in terms of resolution of the corneal lesions and final visual outcome in cases of microsporidial keratoconjunctivitis .,4
"Mean costs ( QALYs ) were 58.46 ( s.d. 0.662 ) for leaflet and advice , 92.12 ( s.d. 0.659 ) for joint protection , 64.51 ( s.d. 0.681 ) for hand exercises and 112.38 ( s.d. 0.658 ) for joint protection plus hand exercises .",3
"In the base case , hand exercises were the cost-effective option , with an ICER of 318 per QALY gained .",3
Hand exercises remained the most cost-effective management strategy when adopting alternative methodological approaches .,3
This is the first trial evaluating the cost-effectiveness of occupational therapy-supported approaches to self-management for hand OA .,4
Our findings showed that hand exercises were the most cost-effective option .,4
"Supervised consumption was accepted by patients , despite causing practical limitations and raising issues of privacy and stigma .",3
Patients recognised that establishing a daily routine away from illicit drugs was useful early in treatment .,3
"However , having flexibility to move away from supervision was important .",3
Unsupervised patients reported that they ultimately preferred this treatment approach and appreciated the trust and sense of reward that unsupervised treatment bought .,3
"Clinicians expressed confidence in supervised prescribing and reduced risk for their patients , but also concern that a minority of individuals may remain inappropriately supervised for lengthy time periods .",3
This study provides an important patient perspective and is the first in-depth qualitative investigation directly comparing supervision with unsupervised treatment to consider both patient and professional perspectives .,4
"Overall , our qualitative findings suggest that flexibly timed discontinuation of supervision may have positive benefits .",4
Three hundred thirty-one eyes/patients completed the study .,3
Microaneurysm formation rate greater than or equal to 2 was present in 68.1 % of the eyes and MA turnover greater than or equal to 6 in 54.0 % at month 6 .,3
Higher MA turnover values were registered in eyes that showed progression in ETDRS severity level ( P < 0.03 ) .,3
There were also significant correlations between increased microaneurysm activity and increases in retinal thickness .,3
Spectral-domain OCT identified clinical macular edema in 24 eyes/patients ( 6.7 % ) and subclinical macular edema in 104 eyes/patients ( 28.9 % ) at baseline .,3
Progression of retinal thickening was registered in eyes that had either subclinical or clinical macular edema at baseline .,3
Changes in MA activity measured with RetmarkerDR and in central retinal thickness in eyes with mild nonproliferative diabetic retinopathy and diabetes type 2 are able to identify eyes at risk of progression .,4
These eyes/patients should be selected for inclusion in future clinical trials of drugs targeted to prevent diabetic retinopathy progression to vision-threatening complications .,4

Men in whom erectile dysfunction and/or lower urinary tract symptoms developed during EDIC had a significantly lower respiratory rate variation and Valsalva ratio at DCCT closeout and EDIC year 16/17 compared to those without erectile dysfunction or lower urinary tract symptoms .,3
"In adjusted analysis , participants with cardiovascular autonomic neuropathy had 2.65 greater odds of erectile dysfunction and lower urinary tract symptoms ( 95 % CI 1.47-4 .79 ) .",3
These data suggest that cardiovascular autonomic neuropathy predicts the development of urological complications in men with long-standing type 1 diabetes .,4
Studies evaluating the mechanisms contributing to these interactions are warranted for targeting effective prevention or treatment .,4
"Improvements were seen in the scores for shoulder flexion ( 94.1 19.79 at baseline increased to 161.9 13.05 after intervention ) , abduction ROM ( 90.4 21.18 at baseline increased to 154.8 13.21 after intervention ) , and pain ( 8.00 0.78 at baseline decreased to 3.48 0.71 after intervention ) in the experimental group .",3
Sixty percent of the participants ( n = 30 ) were improved to the fourth stage of satisfactory joint function according to the Oxford Shoulder Score in the experimental group compared with 18 % ( n = 9 ) in the control group ( p < 0.001 ) .,3
Incorporating shoulder countertraction along with physiotherapy improves shoulder function compared with physiotherapy alone for the treatment of a frozen shoulder .,4
Additional studies are needed focusing on this concept to increase the generalizability of the counter-traction apparatus in various groups .,4
"The study described in this article gives insight into the effectiveness of a possible solution for a prominent public health issue in The Netherlands , which is binge drinking among 16 to 18 year old adolescents .",4
"There were no significant differences in oxytocin use ( 2.5 % difference , CI-4 .3 to 9.4 ) , caesarean sections ( -0.59 % difference , CI-6 .3 to 5.1 ) , epidural use ( 1.5 % difference , CI-5 .1 to 8.2 ) , vaginal delivery within 24 hours ( -8.2 % difference , CI-17 .6 to 1.3 ) or labour complications .",3
"More than half of the randomised women did not receive the intervention as they laboured spontaneously , or did not require ripening .",3
"The post-hoc analysis of women who received ripening also indicated no statistically significant differences in the patterns or results , with the exception of outpatient women having a longer mean length of active labour ( mean difference 66 minutes , CI 4-128 minutes ) .",3
"Outpatient women who received ripening were diagnosed more frequently with non-reassuring CTG monitoring and hyperstimulation , with less than half of the women going home and remaining home overnight .",3
This study demonstrated no clinical advantage or disadvantage in prostaglandin E2 outpatient cervical ripening .,4
Uterine stimulation following prostaglandins may preclude a woman from going home or remaining at home overnight and may not be the best agent for outpatient ripening .,4
"No differences were observed in microvascular parameters at baseline and after transfusion between the groups , except for the proportion of perfused vessels ( PPV ) and blood flow velocity , which were higher after transfusion in the leukodepleted group .",3
"Microvascular flow index in small vessels ( MFI ) and blood flow velocity exhibited different responses to transfusion between the two groups ( P = 0.03 and P = 0.04 , respectively ) , with a positive effect of leukodepleted RBCs .",3
"When within-group changes were examined , microcirculatory improvement was observed only in patients who received leukodepleted RBC transfusion as suggested by the increase in De Backer score ( P = 0.02 ) , perfused vessel density ( P = 0.04 ) , PPV ( P = 0.01 ) , and MFI ( P = 0.04 ) .",3
Blood flow velocity decreased in the non-leukodepleted group ( P = 0.03 ) .,3
THI and StO2 upslope increased in both groups .,3
StO2 and StO2 downslope increased in patients who received non-leukodepleted RBC transfusions .,3
Syndecan-1 increased after the transfusion of non-leukodepleted RBCs ( P = 0.03 ) .,3
"This study does not show a clear superiority of leukodepleted over non-leukodepleted RBC transfusions on microvascular perfusion in patients with sepsis , although it suggests a more favorable effect of leukodepleted RBCs on microcirculatory convective flow .",4
Further studies are needed to confirm these findings .,4
"After 6 , 9 , and 12months post-treatment , NLFs treated with the PCL-based dermal filler showed statistically significant improvements on the Wrinkle Severity Rating Scale and greater improvements on the GAIS compared to NLFs treated with the NASHA-based dermal filler .",3
Both products were found to be equally safe and well tolerated .,3
Our results suggest that PCL-based dermal fillers offer longer-lasting performance over NASHA-based dermal fillers in NLFs treatment .,4
Patients on STS or placebo had a significant decline from baseline ( p < 0.001 ) on their CDRS-R total score with mean reductionsSD as follows : STS 21.416.6 ; placebo 21.516.5 .,3
Both groups had similar response rates ( 58.6 % vs. 59.3 % ) defined as CGI-I of 1 or 2 at study end .,3
"However , these between-group efficacy findings were without statistical significance .",3
The overall incidence of reported AEs was 62.5 % for STS-treated patients and 57.7 % for placebo-treated patients .,3
"Most commonly reported AEs in STS or placebo groups were application site reactions ( STS = 24.3 % ; placebo = 21.8 % ) , headache ( STS = 17.1 % ; placebo = 16.7 % ) , and nausea ( STS = 7.2 % ; placebo = 7.7 % ) .",3
"Treatment groups did not differ on any laboratory parameters , vital signs , or electrocardiogram ( ECG ) findings .",3
No suspected hypertensive crises were reported in the trial .,3
These data demonstrated that the STS was safe and well tolerated in this adolescent sample .,4
"However , both STS-treated and placebo-treated subjects demonstrated a decline from baseline in depressive symptoms ( CDRS-R total score ) over the length of the study , without statistical superiority by either group .",4
"During exposure to audible windfarm sound and infrasound , symptoms and mood were strongly influenced by the type of expectations .",3
"Negative expectation participants experienced a significant increase in symptoms and a significant deterioration in mood , while positive expectation participants reported a significant decrease in symptoms and a significant improvement in mood .",3
The study demonstrates that expectations can influence symptom and mood reports in both positive and negative directions .,4
"The results suggest that if expectations about infrasound are framed in more neutral or benign ways , then it is likely reports of symptoms or negative effects could be nullified .",4
"Only one SNP was associated with a significant effect on LTL , with the minor allele G of OBFC1 rs10786775 SNP being associated with longer LTL ( = 0.029 , P = 0.04 ) .",3
No SNPs were significantly associated with CHD or T2D .,3
"For OBFC1 the haplotype carrying both rare alleles ( rs10786775G and rs11591710C , haplotype frequency 0.089 ) was associated with lower CHD prevalence ( OR : 0.77 ; 95 % CI : 0.61-0 .97 ; P = 0.03 ) .",3
"The TERC haplotype GTC ( rs12696304G , rs10936601T and rs16847897C , haplotype frequency 0.210 ) was associated with lower risk for both CHD ( OR : 0.86 ; 95 % CI : 0.75-0 .99 ; P = 0.04 ) and T2D ( OR : 0.74 ; 95 % CI : 0.61-0 .91 ; P = 0.004 ) , with no effect on LTL .",3
Only the last association remained after adjusting for multiple testing .,3
"Of reported associations , only that between the OBFC1 rs10786775 SNP and LTL was confirmed , although our study has a limited power to detect modest effects .",4
"A 2-SNP OBFC1 haplotype was associated with higher risk of CHD , and a 3-SNP TERC haplotype was associated with both higher risk of CHD and T2D .",4
Further work is required to confirm these results and explore the mechanisms of these effects .,4
"Mixed repeated-measures ancovas demonstrated that those randomized to SPT experienced greater baseline to post-test improvements in UFOV performance relative to controls ( p 's < 0.001 ) , regardless of impairments in near visual acuity , contrast sensitivity or presence of cataracts .",3
"Those with other eye conditions significantly benefitted from training ( p = 0.044 ) , but to a lesser degree than those without such conditions .",3
"Covariates included age and baseline measures of balance and depressive symptoms , which were significantly correlated with baseline UFOV performance .",3
"Among a community-based sample of older adults with and without visual impairment and eye disease , the SPT intervention was effective in enhancing participants ' UFOV performance .",4
"The analyses presented here indicate the potential for SPT to enhance UFOV performance among a community-based sample of older adults with visual impairment and potentially for some with self-reported eye disease ; further research to explore this area is warranted , particularly to determine the effects of eye diseases on SPT benefits .",4
"Of the 40 subjects randomized , there were 15 ( 37.5 % ) discontinuations .",3
Titration resulted in a significant reduction in FLS severity at 8 hours ( p = 0.023 ) averaged over the 3 week treatment period .,3
"The difference in 3 week FLS severity reflects differences during week 1 treatment , indicating an early peak in FLS severity during the No Titration treatment and subsequent development of tolerance .",3
"In contrast , titration results in near baseline severity scores throughout the treatment period .",3
Similar trends were seen for 4 and 12 hour FLS severity scores .,3
"Of the individual FLS , difference in fever severity was most marked .",3
Safety profiles for both regimens were consistent with the approved prescribing information for interferon gamma-1b .,3
"Study limitations included the use of healthy subjects rather than disease subjects , the lack of a validated assessment tool for evaluating FLS and the relatively high discontinuation rate .",3
"A short 2 week , dose-titration regimen reduces FLS severity following interferon gamma-1b treatment initiation in normal subjects .",4
We identified only a few variables associated with a possible increased risk of overdrainage .,3
"Apart from using conventional rather than gravitational valves , longer duration of surgery and female sex were associated with a higher risk of clinical signs and symptoms suggestive of overdrainage ( hazard ratio : 1.02 , 95 % confidence interval : 1.01-1 .04 and 1.84 , 95 % confidence interval : 0.81-4 .16 ) .",3
"The occurrence of clinical symptoms of overdrainage , and the need for exchanging a programmable by a gravitational valve may adversely affect disease-specific outcomes like the Kiefer score .",3
"Few , if any , baseline and treatment characteristics may be helpful in estimating the individual risk of complications and clinical outcomes after shunt surgery for iNPH .",4
Patients should be informed that longer surgery for any reason may increase the risk of later overdrainage .,4
"Also , women should be counseled about a sex-associated increased risk of the development of clinical symptoms of overdrainage , although the latter can not be distinguished from a generally higher prevalence of headaches in the female population .",4
The suPAR levels decreased after 1 year of treatment with MMF ( p < 0.05 ) .,3
"Conversely , suPAR levels increased after 1 year of treatment with CsA in the same patients ( p = 0.01 ) .",3
These changes in suPAR levels were not correlated to the estimated glomerular filtration rate ( eGFR ) or changes in the GFR .,3
Data from this prospective randomized trial suggest that treatment with MMF and CsA is associated with different effects on suPAR levels in children with MCD and that these are independent of their effects on GFR .,4
"In GA , subfoveal CT ( fCT ) was significantly thinner compared to controls ( 173.03 90.22 vs. 253.95 69.19 m , P < 0.001 ) .",3
"Analysis of averaged measurements of all 25 points obtained per patient ( mCT ) revealed similar results ( 162.07 76.26 vs. 228.00 66.24 m , P < 0.001 ) .",3
Spatial differences in CT between both groups were largest superior to the fovea .,3
"Addressing `` diffuse-trickling '' ( n = 15 ) and `` non-diffuse-trickling '' ( n = 57 ) GA independently , fCT was 114.67 43.32 and 188.39 93.26 m , respectively ( P = 0.002 ) , with both groups being significantly thinner than controls ( P < 0.001 for `` diffuse-trickling '' and P < 0.001 for '' ?",3
non-diffuse-trickling '' ) .,3
"Similar results were obtained for mCT , which was 110.21 29.66 m in `` diffuse-trickling , '' 175.72 79.02 m in '' ?",3
non-diffuse-trickling '' and 228.00 66.24 m in controls .,3
Differences were significant with P = 0.002 between both GA groups and P 0.001 toward controls for each GA group .,3
The results indicate that the choroid in eyes with GA is thinner compared to normal eyes of similar age .,4
"Hereby , the extent of thinning is most pronounced in a specific subtype of GA identified by FAF imaging ( `` diffuse trickling '' ) .",4
Such GA subtype-related differences in choroidal thickness may reflect heterogeneity in the pathogenesis of disease .,4

"As such , the CP was found to be the dominant treatment , being more effective and less costly than SC ( 95 % confidence interval : dominant to 6225 per QALY ) .",3
"Despite the CP delaying the onset of diabetes by 10 months , there was no significant difference in the incidence of type 2 diabetes , with the CP achieving < 0.1 % fewer cases than SC over the lifetime .",3
The modelled results suggest that referral to community-based interventions may provide a highly cost-effective approach for those at high risk of weight-related comorbidities .,4
"Patients showed significant ( p < 0.05 ) gains in walking speed , other walking - and mobility related tests , and strength of the paretic knee extensors relative to baseline at all assessments .",3
"However , there were no significant differences in improvements in any of the variables between groups at any time during the study .",3
These results indicate that substituting Lokomat therapy for some of conventional therapy is as effective in recovering walking ability in non-ambulatory stroke patients as conventional therapy alone .,4
Implications for Rehabilitation Recovery of walking after stroke is important .,4
Robot-assisted therapy is currently receiving much attention in research and rehabilitation practice as devices such as the Lokomat seem to be promising assistive devices .,4
"Technical developments , sub-optimal study designs in literature and new therapy insights warrant new effectiveness studies .",4
RESULTS of a financially and practically feasible study indicate that substituting Lokomat therapy for some of conventional therapy is as effective in recovering walking ability in non-ambulatory stroke patients as compared to conventional overground therapy alone .,4
Engaging and supporting people with HD in a regular physical activity program raises a number of challenges .,4
The physical activity intervention and the comparator social interaction intervention have been developed following consultation with people with HD and their families .,4
Each are individually tailored and determined on individual needs and goals .,4
The results from this trial will provide guidance for the development of definitive trials .,4
We randomised 126 subjects aged 40-70years ( mean age 55.5 years ; 72 females ( 57.1 % ) ) .,3
Mean nominated visual analogue scale ( 0-10cm ) pain score at baseline was 6.5 cm .,3
94 knees ( 75 % ) had PF BMLs at baseline .,3
Subjects wore the brace for a mean of 7.4 h/day .,3
6 subjects withdrew during the trial .,3
"After accounting for baseline values , the brace group had lower knee pain than the control group at 6weeks ( difference between groups -1.3 cm , 95 % CI -2.0 to -0.7 ; p < 0.001 ) and reduced PF BML volume ( difference -490.6 mm ( 3 ) , 95 % CI -929.5 to -51.7 ; p = 0.03 ) but not tibiofemoral volume ( difference -53.9 mm ( 3 ) , 95 % CI -625.9 to 518.2 ; p = 0.85 ) .",3
"A PF brace reduces BML volume in the targeted compartment of the knee , and relieves knee pain .",4
"Participants in both groups showed baseline to endpoint reductions in mood symptoms and improvements in functionality , quality of life and medication adherence .",3
"The MoodSwings-Plus group showed a greater number of within-group changes on symptoms and functioning in depression and mania , quality of life and social support , across both poles of the illness .",3
MoodSwings-Plus was superior to MoodSwings in improvement on symptoms of mania scores at 12 months ( p = 0.02 ) but not on the incidence of recurrence .,3
The study did not have an attention control group and therefore could not demonstrate efficacy of the two active arms .,4
There was notable ( 81 % ) attrition by 12 months from baseline .,4
This study suggests that both CBT and psychoeducation delivered online may have utility in the management of bipolar disorder .,4
"They are feasible , readily accepted , and associated with improvement .",4
Training resulted in improved reasoning performance through Year 5 .,3
A significant third annual booster effect was one-half the size of the training effect .,3
Training adherence resulted in greater training effects .,3
"Higher education , Mini-Mental State Exam ( MMSE ) , better health , and younger age related to higher baseline performance .",3
"Higher MMSE was related to larger training effects , larger linear slopes , and smaller booster effects .",3
"Significant functional outcomes included a training effect for complex reaction time ( CRT ) , and first annual booster effects for the CRT and observed tasks of daily living .",3
Initial training gain was comparable with magnitude of age-related cognitive decline over 5 years with no training .,4
"Neither age nor gender predicted training or booster effects , indicating the generality of training effects across age ( 65-90 years ) .",4
Mean patient age was 66 ( 86 ) years and 36 % were women .,3
"The study included 58 % European/Caucasian , 33 % Asians , 5 % Latin/Hispanic , and 4 % Black African .",3
"There were 74 % of patients that were hypertensive , and average systolic and diastolic blood pressure was 1441/838mmHg .",3
There was at least one significant difference in the overall test of all race-ethnic groups in myocardial infarction and symptomatic intracerebral hemorrhage occurrence .,3
"In the Kaplan-Meier hemorrhage and stroke-free survival curves , Asians showed a significantly higher recurrence of ischemic stroke risk in the 135-150mmHg and greater than 150mm Hg blood pressure groups , and a greater risk of hemorrhage recurrence in the greater than 150mmHg blood pressure group .",3
We found a significant difference in myocardial infarction and symptomatic intracerebral hemorrhage recurrence among different race-ethnic groups .,4
The risk of recurrent ischemic and hemorrhagic stroke was greater in Asians with high blood pressure .,4
A total of 1369 patients at 13 centers in England underwent randomization : 694 to tight glycemic control and 675 to conventional glycemic control ; 60 % had undergone cardiac surgery .,3
"The mean between-group difference in the number of days alive and free from mechanical ventilation at 30 days was 0.36 days ( 95 % confidence interval [ CI ] , -0.42 to 1.14 ) ; the effects did not differ according to subgroup .",3
"Severe hypoglycemia ( blood glucose , < 36 mg per deciliter [ 2.0 mmol per liter ] ) occurred in a higher proportion of children in the tight-glycemic-control group than in the conventional-glycemic-control group ( 7.3 % vs. 1.5 % , P < 0.001 ) .",3
"Overall , the mean 12-month costs were lower in the tight-glycemic-control group than in the conventional-glycemic-control group .",3
"The mean 12-month costs were similar in the two groups in the cardiac-surgery subgroup , but in the subgroup that had not undergone cardiac surgery , the mean cost was significantly lower in the tight-glycemic-control group than in the conventional-glycemic-control group : - $ 13,120 ( 95 % CI , - $ 24,682 to - $ 1,559 ) .",3
"This multicenter , randomized trial showed that tight glycemic control in critically ill children had no significant effect on major clinical outcomes , although the incidence of hypoglycemia was higher with tight glucose control than with conventional glucose control .",4

"BDD-NET was deemed highly acceptable by patients and led to significant improvements on the BDD-YBOCS ( p = < 0.001 ) with a large within-group effect size ( Cohen 's d = 2.01 , 95 % CI 1.05 to 2.97 ) .",3
"At post-treatment , 82 % of the patients were classified as responders ( defined as30 % improvement on the BDD-YBOCS ) .",3
These gains were maintained at the 3-month follow-up .,3
"Secondary outcome measures of depression , global functioning and quality of life also showed significant improvements with moderate to large effect sizes .",3
"On average , therapists spent 10 min per patient per week providing support .",3
"The results suggest that BDD-NET has the potential to greatly increase access to CBT , at least for low-risk individuals with moderately severe BDD symptoms and reasonably good insight .",4
A randomised controlled trial of BDD-NET is warranted .,4
"The WF group had a 74.4 % reduction in whole mouth plaque and 81.6 % for approximal plaque compared to 57.7 % and 63.4 % for the SF group , respectively ( p < 0.001 ) .",3
The differences between the groups showed the water flosser was 29 % more effective than string floss for overall plaque removal and approximal surfaces specifically ( p < 0.001 ) .,3
"The WF group was more effective in removing plaque from the marginal , lingual , and facial regions ; 33 % , 39 % , and 24 % , respectively ( p < 0.001 ) .",3
The Waterpik Water Flosser and manual toothbrush is significantly more effective than a manual brush and string floss in removing plaque from tooth surfaces .,4
We did not find a significant difference in tremor amplitude between patients and controls for either DT or TAD .,3
Neither differed tremor amplitude in the within-patient comparisons .,3
Both hypotheses were rejected and apparently neither DT nor TAD occur in musician 's dystonia of the fingers .,4
This is the first study assessing DT and TAD in musician 's dystonia .,4
"Our finding suggests that even though MD is an excellent model for malplasticity due to excessive practice , it does not seem to provide a good model for DT .",4
Rather it seems that musician 's dystonia may manifest itself either as dystonic cramping without tremor or as task-specific tremor without overt dystonic cramping .,4
A total of 213 patients ( 90.3 % ) completed the study .,3
"After 1 year of treatment , BMD among patients in Group M significantly increased from baseline by 1.2 % and 2.7 % at the lumbar spine and trochanter , respectively ( P < 0.001 ) ; and the percentage increase of BMD in Group A was 2.2 % and 1.8 % , respectively ( P < 0.001 ) .",3
No difference was observed between groups .,3
There were no changes in femoral neck BMD in both groups .,3
"Two patients ( 1.9 % , 2/108 ) in Group M and four patients ( 3.8 % , 4/105 ) in Group A had new fracture onsets ( P > 0.05 ) .",3
"In Group M , OC and ucOC decreased from baseline by 38.7 % and 82.3 % , respectively ( P < 0.001 ) .",3
"In Group A , OC and ucOC decreased by 25.8 % and 34.8 % , respectively ( P < 0.001 ) .",3
Decreases in serum OC and ucOC were more obvious in Group M than in Group A ( P < 0.001 ) .,3
The safety profile of menatetrenone was similar to alfacalcidol .,3
Menatetrenone is an effective and safe choice in the treatment of postmenopausal osteoporosis in Chinese women .,4
Forty-eight patients were randomized to MT ( n = 27 ) or the control group ( n = 21 ) .,3
"Improvement in scores on the star cancellation test over 6 months was greater in the MT group ( mean difference 23 , 95 % confidence interval [ CI ] 19-28 ; p < 0.0001 ) .",3
"Similarly , improvement in the MT group was observed in the scores on the picture identification task ( mean difference 3.2 , 95 % CI 2.4-4 .0 ; p < 0.0001 ) and line bisection test ( mean difference 8.6 , 95 % CI 2.7-14 .6 ; p = 0.006 ) .",3
"In patients with stroke , MT is a simple treatment that improves unilateral neglect .",4
No statistically significant effect of rivastigmine treatment on cognitive function in HD patients was detected .,3
There was no evidence for practice or placebo effect .,3
Detailed neuropsychological assessment did not confirm previously reported effect of rivastigmine treatment on cognitive function in HD patients .,4
"The limitations of our study are , in particular , small sample size and the lack of a single measure of relevant cognitive functioning in HD patients .",4
"Instead of focusing solely on statistical significance , a clinical relevance study is proposed to clarify the issue of rivastigmine effects in HD .",4
Performing a spirometry test and providing information on pulmonary function may increase awareness of the effect of smoking among smokers who are asymptomatic or have few symptoms and make them decide to quit .,4
"Specifically , in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease it might increase levels of motivation to quit smoking in early stages of the disease .",4
"If this strategy were to be effective , it could be included in the health promotion activities offered in primary care .",4
The payment contingencies were effective in producing greater smoking abstinence in the 15C vs. 2C conditions .,3
"Ratings of withdrawal decreased , while ratings of ease and confidence in abstaining increased in the 15C vs. 2C conditions across the 15-day study .",3
15C participants were less likely to choose the smoking option in the preference session .,3
"15C participants reported greater reductions in craving compared to the 2C participants in the presence of smoking-related and neutral stimuli ( i.e. , decreases in generalized craving ) , but no differences were noted in cue reactivity per se or in response inhibition .",3
"Results systematically replicate prior observations that a period 2weeks of initial abstinence decreases the relative reinforcing effects of smoking and improves other outcomes associated with relapse risk compared to the initial day or two of a cessation effort , and extends them by underscoring the importance of generalized rather than cue-induced craving in relation to relapse risk during the initial weeks of smoking cessation .",4
"The standard physiotherapy treatment accompanied by knee distraction resulted in significantly higher improvement in pain ( P = 0.004 ) , functional ability ( P = 0.02 ) , quality of life ( P = 0.002 ) and knee flexion range of motion ( p = 0.02 ) compared to the standard physiotherapy treatment alone post treatment and after 1 month follow up .",3
"Adding knee distraction to standard physiotherapy treatment can result in further improvement in pain relief , increased functional ability and better quality of life in patients with severe knee osteoarthritis .",4
There were no significant differences in the objective response rate ( P = 0.711 ) and disease control rate ( P = 0.861 ) between the two groups .,3
"The progression-free survival of gefitinib group and erlotinib group was 8.0 months and 10.0 months , respectively .",3
The efficacy of the two drugs was similar ( P = 0.293 ) .,3
There is no significant differences between gefitinib and erlotinib in the first-line treatment of patients with advanced EGFR mutation-positive NSCLC .,4
The 150 subjects in the study were divided into two equal groups of 75 ( 50 % ) each .,3
Good to excellent results were seen in 51 ( 68 % ) cases in Group A compared to 63 ( 84 % ) in Group B. Frequency of complications was 18 ( 24 % ) and 6 ( 8 % ) in Group A and Group B respectively .,3
Combination of triamcinolone acetonide and 5 flourouracil is superior to triamcinolone acetonide therapy in the treatment of keloids and hypertrophic scars .,4
Data from 86 patients ( 43 in each group ) were analyzed .,3
Block execution took more time for group M than group S.,3
"The proportion of patients with complete sensory blockade of all sciatic components at 30 minutes after injection was significantly larger for group M than group S ( 41.9 % vs 16.3 % , P = 0.018 ) .",3
"Complete motor blockade of foot and toes extension also was observed more frequently in group M than in group S ( 67.4 % vs 34.9 % , P = 0.005 and 51.2 % vs 25.6 % , P = 0.027 , respectively ) .",3
"When ultrasound-guided subgluteal sciatic nerve block is conducted , multiple injections of local anesthetic to make a circumferential spread around the sciatic nerve improve the rate of sensory and motor blocks compared with a single injection .",4
"For the SPPB results favored HSC over SH ( 1.1 , 95 % CI ( -.1 to 2.4 ) , p = .08 ) and showed a moderate effect size ( Hedge g = 0.6 , 95 % CI ( -0.4 , 1.6 ) ) .",3
"For secondary outcomes , lower body power ( mean difference = 158 W , 95 % CI ( 2 , 315 ) ; p = .01 ) and RPE ( mean difference = -1.5 , 95 % CI ( -2.9 , -0.12 ) ; p = .04 ) also favored HSC .",3
"IADL , SMI , BF % , upper and lower body strength and upper body power , showed no statistically significant differences between groups .",3
"Considering the moderate effect size , the large treatment effect shown by the upper limit of the 95 % CI , the low perceived exertion , and no adverse effects , HSC training should be further investigated with a larger sample size in sarcopenic obese adults .",4
"The nasal symptoms , including nasal obstruction , rhinorrhea , itching , and sneezing , had significantly improved at 3 months after treatment in both groups ( P < 0.001 ) .",3
Improvement of nasal obstruction in the SBR group was greater than that in the ITR group at 3 months ( P < 0.05 ) .,3
Acoustic rhinometry demonstrated a significant increase in the cross-sectional area and nasal volume in both groups 3 months after surgery .,3
The postoperative change in nasal volume was higher in the SBR group ( P < 0.05 ) .,3
"No adverse reactions such as bleeding , infection , adhesions , or olfactory changes were encountered in the SBR group .",3
Combined SBVR and turbinoplasty appears to be more effective than turbinoplasty alone for the treatment of nasal obstruction in patients with inferior turbinate and septal body hypertrophy .,4
"Significant positive intervention effects were found for average SSB consumption ( B -0.19 litres , 95 % CI -0.28 ; -0.10 ; parent report ) , average SSB servings ( B -0.54 servings , 95 % CI -0.82 ; -0.26 ; parent report ) and bringing SSB to school ( OR 0.51 , 95 % CI 0.36 ; 0.72 ; observation report ) .",3
This study supports the effectiveness of the water campaign intervention in reducing children 's SSB consumption .,4
Further studies are needed to replicate our findings .,4
CBT was effective in reducing PTSD and depressive symptoms and improved psychological resilience .,3
General support was more effective than no intervention in improving psychological resilience .,3
Short-term CBT group intervention seems to be a robust intervention for natural disaster victims .,4
Short-term CBT group intervention was more effective than the general supportive intervention and the no-treatment group in enhancing psychological resilience and reducing PTSD and depression among adolescents who had lost parents in the earthquake .,4
The general supportive intervention was effective only in improving psychological resilience .,4
A total of 136 patients were enrolled .,3
"Mean operation times were significantly prolonged in the TURis group ( 68.4 and 79.5 minutes for monopolar and TURis groups , respectively ; P = .048 ) .",3
"Nosignificant differences in the decline of hemoglobin , hematocrit , and perioperative transfusion rates between groups were seen , whereas clot retention ( grade 2 ) after the treatment seemed to occur more often in the monopolar group ( 7 of 62 [ 12.3 % ] in monopolar group vs 1 of 63 [ 1/8 % ] in TURis group ; P = .061 ) .",3
No case presented symptomatic transurethral resection syndrome in either groups .,3
"Continued efficacy at 36months after the treatment could be confirmed for the first time in TURis system , which also seems to be preferable as they produced more clinically favorable outcomes .",4
"Nevertheless , the TURis system required significantly more resection time , which might not entirely be a panacea for the treatment of benign prostatic obstruction , especially for patients having larger prostatic volumes .",4
A randomized controlled trial and resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging ( fMRI ) were conducted .,3
"A total of eighty migraineurs without aura were enrolled to receive either active acupoint acupuncture or inactive acupoint acupuncture treatment for 8 weeks , and twenty patients in each group were randomly selected for the fMRI scan at the end of baseline and at the end of treatment .",3
The neuroimaging data indicated that long-term active acupoint therapy elicited a more extensive and remarkable cerebral response compared with acupuncture at inactive acupoints .,3
"Most of the regions were involved in the pain matrix , lateral pain system , medial pain system , default mode network , and cognitive components of pain processing .",3
Correlation analysis showed that the decrease in the visual analogue scale ( VAS ) was significantly related to the increased average Regional homogeneity ( ReHo ) values in the anterior cingulate cortex in the two groups .,3
"Moreover , the decrease in the VAS was associated with increased average ReHo values in the insula which could be detected in the active acupoint group .",3
Long-term active acupoint therapy and inactive acupoint therapy have different brain activities .,4
"We postulate that acupuncture at the active acupoint might have the potential effect of regulating some disease-affected key regions and the pain circuitry for migraine , and promote establishing psychophysical pain homeostasis .",4
Weight and body mass index ( BMI ) of the control group after 4weeks were significantly increased compared with baseline values .,3
Serum total cholesterol ( T-Chol ) and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol ( LDL-Chol ) of the intervention group after 4weeks were significantly reduced compared with baseline values .,3
"Furthermore , intake of total vegetables and fruits were significantly increased compared with baseline values in both groups .",3
Both vegetable juices contributed to improved intake of total vegetables and fruit .,4
"Compared with the intake of commercial vegetable juice , the intake of fresh fruit and B. rapa juice is highly effective in reducing serum cholesterol .",4
Short-term intake of fresh fruit and B. rapa juice was shown to enhance cholesterol metabolism .,4
"Our results show that tDCS prevented a decrement in vigilance and led to better subjective ratings for fatigue , drowsiness , energy , and composite mood compared to caffeine and control in sleep-deprived individuals .",3
Both the tDCS and caffeine produced similar improvements in latencies on a short-term memory task and faster reaction times in a psychomotor task when compared to the placebo group .,3
"Interestingly , changes in accuracy for the tDCS group were not correlated to changes in mood ; whereas , there was a relationship for the caffeine and sham groups .",3
Our data suggest that tDCS could be a useful fatigue countermeasure and may be more beneficial than caffeine since boosts in performance and mood last several hours .,4
"Despite a tendency to lower habitual fibre intake in UC patients , faecal NSP and starch concentrations were threefold higher than in controls , whereas concentrations of phenols and short-chain fatty acids , pH and WGTT were similar .",3
Increasing RS/WB intake was well tolerated .,3
"In controls ( n = 10 ) , it more than doubled faecal NSP and starch excretion ( p = 0.002 for both ) , had no effect on NSP usage and reduced WGTT ( p = 0.024 ) .",3
"In UC patients ( n = 19 ) , high intake of RS/WB tended to normalise gut transit , but did not increase the proportion of NSP fermented .",3
Increasing intake of RS/WB had little effect on faecal fermentation patterns or the structure of the microbiota .,3
"However , faeces from the UC cohort had lower proportions of Akkermansia muciniphila and increased diversity within Clostridium cluster XIVa compared to controls .",3
Gut fermentation of NSP and starch is diminished in patients with UC .,4
"This can not be explained by abnormal gut transit and was not corrected by increasing RS/WB intake , and may be due to abnormal functioning of the gut microbiota .",4
This trial will provide powerful insight into whether the design of the COMPLETE-SE stent is more fracture-resistant or effective in preventing restenosis compared with the SMART CONTROL stent .,4
"Also , it will determine the efficacy and safety of aspirin plus clopidogrel versus aspirin plus cilostazol in patients undergoing stent implantation in femoropopliteal lesions .",4
"A total of 108 patients were randomized , and 100 completed the study ( 46 continuous , 54 as required ) .",3
"The overall pain scores at discharge did not differ between those who used Entonox continuously and as required ( mean = 2.4 vs. 3.2 , P = 0.08 ) .",3
"There were also no differences in the experience of pain during colonoscopy ( mean = 1.8 vs. 2.2 , P = 0.28 ; peak = 4.2 vs. 4.8 , P = 0.26 ; and area under curve = 23 vs. 30 , P = 0.24 ) .",3
"Patients with high anxiety had greater overall pain scores ( mean = 3.7 vs. 2.4 , P = 0.03 ) .",3
"Light headedness occurred more often with continuous Entonox use ( 48 vs. 21 % , P = 0.009 ) .",3
"Among patients attending for screening colonoscopy , comfort ratings were similar in those using Entonox continuously and as required , but light headedness was more common with continuous use ( NCT identifier : 01865721 ) .",4
"Endometrial thickness was similar ( 9.03 1.65 vs. 9.12 1.58 , P > 0.05 ) in artificial and stimulated cycle .",3
"The two protocols resulted in clinical pregnancy rate ( 41.0 % vs. 41.6 % , P > 0.05 ) , ongoing pregnancy rate ( 36.6 % vs. 34.7 % , P > 0.05 ) , live birth rate ( 30.0 % vs. 31.7 % , P > 0.05 ) , which were not statistically different .",3
"Nevertheless , the cancelled cycle rate made a significant difference ( 2.2 % vs. 5.4 % , P < 0.05 ) .",3
"There is no significant difference in the clinical pregnancy rate in HMG , HMG added with vaginal oestradiol and HMG switch to vaginal oestradiol group ( 42.6 % , 41.1 % , and 33.3 % , respectively ) .",3
"The mean endometrial thickness , clinical pregnancy rate , ongoing pregnancy rate , live birth rate and implantation rate were similar in artificial and stimulated cycle for endometrial preparation prior to FET in PCOS .",4
It was fine to add vaginal 17 - oestradiol to stimulated cycle when necessary .,4
"However , stimulated cycles had a significantly higher cancelled cycle rate .",4
"We should follow the principles of individualization , securitization and optimization in endometrial preparation of the FET in patients with PCOS .",4
"The mean stool consistency score was higher in the CF group throughout the study ( CF > EF8 and CF > HM for all study periods and CF > EF4 from DOL 15 to 35 , P < 0.05 ) .",3
"There was a significantly higher percentage of watery stools in the EF8 versus the CF group from study day 1 ( SD 1 ) to DOL 14 ( P < 0.05 ) , but no differences between the groups in number of stools per day .",3
The percentage of feedings with spit up and/or vomiting within 1 hour after feeding was significantly lower for HM versus EF8 and CF from SD 1 to DOL 14 ( P < 0.05 ) .,3
"In this clinical study , milk-based term infant formula ( Similac Advance ) with 4 g GOS/L was well-tolerated in terms of stool consistency and additional measures of gastrointestinal tolerance by newborn infants through the first 4 months of life .",4
"Sixty-nine patients were included ( methylphenidate : n = 31 , placebo : n = 38 ) ; median daily dose of methylphenidate was 25 mg .",3
Fifty-eight patients ( 84 % ) who completed the first week of treatment were considered suitable for evaluation .,3
"In the intention to treat analysis , there were 14/31 ( 45 % ) responses with methylphenidate and 10/38 ( 26 % ) responses with placebo ( difference : 19 % ; 95 % CI : 4 % to 39 % ; p = 0.10 ) .",3
"With the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale , 11/19 ( 58 % ) patients with methylphenidate and 10/24 ( 42 % ) with placebo improved from a score compatible with depression in the first 7 days ( difference 16 % ; 95 % CI 13 % to 42 % ; p = 0.29 ) .",3
The proportion of patients indicating adverse effects was similar for both cohorts ( p = 0.99 ) .,3
"Compared with the placebo , methylphenidate demonstrated a positive trend in the incidence of response for depressive symptoms in advanced cancer patients .",4
A total of 231 employees were randomized to either the intervention group ( n = 116 ) or to CAU ( n = 115 ) .,3
Completion of assessments varied between 54 % -74 % .,3
Improvement in depressive symptoms between baseline and posttreatment was shown in all participants and these effects sustained over time .,3
"However , there were no differences between the 2 groups ( adjusted regression coefficient = 0.46 , 95 % CI -2.11 to 3.03 , P = .72 ; Cohen 's d = 0.05 ) .",3
Differences between groups were also not significant for the secondary outcomes .,3
"No subgroups were identified to show differences between the groups , nor did we find a between-group effect in the per-protocol analyses .",3
"This study showed that a worker-directed , Web-based , guided self-help intervention was not more effective than CAU in reducing depressive symptoms among employees with depressive symptoms who were not on sick leave over the period of 1 year .",4
An intervention for this specific target group might not be necessary because the recovery in the CAU group was comparable to the intervention group and sustained over a 12-month period .,4
Thirty eyes of 25 patients were treated .,3
The mean maximum K value flattened by 0.9 diopter ( D ) ( baseline 58.7 D ; 6 months 57.8 D ) ( P = .01 ) .,3
The maximum K worsened by 2.0 D or more in 1 patient .,3
The mean CDVA improved by 0.83 Snellen lines ( P = .03 ) .,3
One patient lost 2 lines of CDVA .,3
"There were no differences in the UDVA , CDVA , or keratometry outcomes between the 1-minute instillation subgroup and the 2-minute instillation subgroup .",3
Transepithelial CXL resulted in a statistically significant improvement in maximum K values and CDVA at the 6-month follow-up .,4
Further follow-up is necessary to ascertain the ability of transepithelial CXL to achieve long-term stabilization of the cornea in eyes with keratoconus .,4
"REE showed group differences in posttraining conditions ( the 4-week group vs. the control group , 1220169 vs. 1067144 kcal/die , and the 8-week group vs. the control group , 1202151 vs. 1067144 kcal/die , P = 0.047 ) , but RHR decreased ( pre-program vs. post program : 9722 vs. 808 beat/min , P = 0.001 ) and VO ( 2peak ) significantly increased ( pre-program vs. post program : 27.87.8 vs. 34.86.5 mL/kg/min , P = 0.001 ) in the 8-week group compared to the control group .",3
Eight weeks of supervised play-based activity increased REE and VO ( 2peak ) in adolescents with concomitant decreases in RHR .,4
These data suggest that this novel model of exercise prescription could be considered world-wide by clinicians to improve fitness base in adolescents and help to combat the growing epidemic of childhood obesity .,4
"No significant change was noted in the baseline concentration of glutamate in the masseter muscle , blood , or saliva , but the peak concentration in the masseter muscle increased significantly between day 1 and 5 .",3
"A statistically significant increase in systolic and diastolic blood pressures after MSG administration was observed , as well as a significantly higher frequency of reports of nausea and headache in the MSG group .",3
No robust effect of MSG on muscle sensitivity was found .,3
Interstitial glutamate concentration in the masseter muscle is not highly disturbed by excessive repetitive intake of MSG in healthy man .,4

"After vaccination , antibody titers increased a median of 64-fold .",3
Vaccine response to 40 % of the standard dose administered intradermally was comparable to that of the standard dose of IPV administered intramuscularly and resulted in higher ( although not significantly ) antibody titers .,3
Intradermal administration had higher a incidence of local side effects ( redness and itching ) but a similar incidence of systemic side effects and was preferred by study participants over intramuscular administration .,3
A 60 % reduction in the standard IPV dose without reduction in antibody titers is possible through intradermal administration .,4
"In total , 803 patients were accrued , and 706 patients were randomly allocated to all 6 treatment arms .",3
Comparisons of induction PF versus adjuvant PF did not indicate a significant improvement .,3
"Unadjusted comparisons of induction cisplatin and capecitabine ( PX ) versus adjuvant PF indicated a favorable trend in progression-free survival for the conventional fractionation arm ( P = .045 ) ; analyses that were adjusted for other significant factors and fractionation reflected a significant reduction in the hazards of disease progression ( hazard ratio [ HR ] , 0.54 ; 95 % confidence interval [ CI ] , 0.36-0 .80 ) and death ( HR , 0.42 ; 95 % CI , 0.25-0 .70 ) .",3
"Unadjusted comparisons of induction sequences versus adjuvant sequences did not reach statistical significance , but adjusted comparisons indicated favorable improvements by induction sequence .",3
"Comparisons of induction PX versus induction PF revealed fewer toxicities ( neutropenia and electrolyte disturbance ) , unadjusted comparisons of efficacy were statistically insignificant , but adjusted analyses indicated that induction PX had a lower hazard of death ( HR , 0.57 ; 95 % CI , 0.34-0 .97 ) .",3
Changing the fractionation from conventional to accelerated did not achieve any benefit but incurred higher toxicities ( acute mucositis and dehydration ) .,3
"Preliminary results indicate that the benefit of changing to an induction-concurrent sequence remains uncertain ; replacing fluorouracil with oral capecitabine warrants further validation in view of its convenience , favorable toxicity profile , and favorable trends in efficacy ; and accelerated fractionation is not recommended for patients with locoregionally advanced NPC who receive chemoradiotherapy .",4
We observed a high rate of dropout ( 50 % ) during the 9-week treatment program .,3
Fifty-two patients were included in the intention-to-treat analysis .,3
"Of these , ten ( 19 % ) remained abstinent after 9 weeks of treatment as indicated by negative urine samples for THC .",3
Escitalopram provided no advantage over placebo in either abstinence rates from cannabis or anxiety and depression scores during the withdrawal and abstinent periods .,3
"Escitalopram treatment does not provide an additional benefit either for achieving abstinence , or for the treatment of the cannabis withdrawal syndrome .",4
"Due to limitations of our study , namely , a high dropout rate and effects of low abstinence rates on measures of anxiety , depression and withdrawal , it is premature to conclude that selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors are not effective for treatment of the cannabis withdrawal syndrome .",4
Patients with a suspected ST-elevation myocardial infarction were randomly assigned at a 1:1 ratio to receive percutaneous coronary intervention either with ( n = 63 ) or without ( n = 62 ) RIPC ( intermittent arm ischemia through three cycles of 5min of inflation and 5min of deflation of a blood pressure cuff ) .,3
A total of 47 RIPC patients and 47 control patients met all study criteria .,3
"The primary endpoint was the incidence of CI-AKI , which was defined as an increase in serum creatinine > 0.5 mg/dL or > 25 % over the baseline value 48-72h after administration of contrast medium .",3
The incidence of CI-AKI was 10 % ( n = 5 ) in the RIPC group and 36 % ( n = 17 ) in the control group ( p = 0.003 ) .,3
The odds ratio of CI-AKI in patients who received RIPC was 0.18 ( 95 % confidence interval : 0.05-0 .64 ; p = 0.008 ) .,3
"In patients with ST-elevation myocardial infarction , RIPC before percutaneous coronary intervention reduced the incidence of CI-AKI .",4
"At 12 months erectile function scores were better for sildenafil citrate than placebo ( p = 0.018 ) , 73 % of patients on sildenafil citrate vs 50 % on placebo had mild/no erectile dysfunction ( p = 0.024 ) and the sildenafil citrate arm had superior overall satisfaction ( p = 0.027 ) and IIEF total scores ( p = 0.043 ) .",3
"At 24months erectile function and IIEF scores were no longer significantly better for sildenafil citrate ( p = 0.172 and 0.09 , respectively ) and yet overall satisfaction scores were higher ( p = 0.033 ) .",3
Sexual desire scores in patients who received sildenafil citrate were higher at 24 months although they had completed drug therapy 18 months previously ( p = 0.049 ) .,3
At 24 months 81.6 % of patients on sildenafil citrate and 56.0 % of those on placebo achieved functional erection with or without erectile dysfunction medication ( p = 0.045 ) .,3
Daily sildenafil citrate during and after radiotherapy for prostate cancer was associated with improved overall sexual function compared with placebo for various sexual function domains .,4
"To our knowledge this is the largestrandomized , prospective , controlled trial to show the usefulness of a phosphodiesterase-5 inhibitor as a rehabilitation strategy in patients with prostate cancer who received radiation therapy .",4
"EPHESUS patients were divided into PCI-treated and non-PCI-treated cohorts , and the effect of eplerenone upon mortality and other major adverse cardiovascular outcomes was assessed in each cohort .",3
"The PCI-treated patients ( n = 1580 ) were younger , and had better renal function and fewer co-morbidities than non-PCI-treated patients ( n = 5052 ) .",3
"Cardiovascular mortality was significantly lower in PCI-treated patients as compared with non-PCI-treated patients ( 7 % vs. 16 % , P < 0.0001 ) .",3
"However , the incidence of non-fatal events was similar in PCI-treated and non-PCI-treated cohorts .",3
There was no statistical difference between the PCI-treated and non-PCI-treated cohorts in the primary or secondary outcomes of the trial .,3
"Eplerenone administration , compared with placebo , in the PCI-treated cohort did not affect PCI-related clinical outcomes , including recurrence of angina , the occurrence of acute coronary syndromes , or the need for further revascularization .",3
The beneficial effects of eplerenone in the EPHESUS trial exist for both PCI - and non-PCI-treated AMI patients with LVSD .,4
"Eplerenone has minimal , if any , effect upon reducing PCI-related adverse events in the PCI-treated cohort .",4
Logistic regression analysis with 339 cases and 276 controls showed that elevated IL-8 and IL-1 were more common in cord blood serum from infants with subsequent low MDI as compared with controls .,3
"After adjusting for additional confounders , the significant differences were no longer evident .",3
"Cytokine levels ( IL-8 , IL-1 , and TNF - ) were not elevated with CP or low PDI .",3
"Cord serum IL-8 , IL-1 , and TNF - levels in preterm infants are not associated with subsequent CP or NDD .",4
This randomized study will evaluate the effectiveness and safety of integrated versus consecutive task training in patients with Parkinson 's disease .,4
"The study will also highlight whether dual task gait training leads to robust motor learning effects , and whether these can be retained and carried-over to untrained dual tasks and functional mobility .",4
"Three weeks of self-treatment with the Kyrobak reduced pain levels significantly in the IT group compared with the WLC group { mean [ standard deviation ( SD ) ] NRS score from baseline to post-treatment : IT group , 1.4 ( 1.5 ) , 95 % confidence interval ( CI ) 0.5 to 2.3 ; WLC group , -0.1 ( 2.2 ) , 95 % CI -1.1 to 1.2 ; effect mean difference 1.5 } .",3
"This benefit was maintained over the follow-up period [ from baseline to end of follow-up , mean ( SD ) NRS score 1.1 ( 1.8 ) , 95 % CI 0.4 to 1.8 ] .",3
Multi-linear regression analysis found that higher baseline pain resulted in greater pain reduction ( P = 0.003 ) .,3
"Eighty-three percent of participants with a baseline NRS score > 4.35 ( threshold determined by logistic regression , P = 0.01 ) achieved the minimal important change criterion of NRS score 2 .",3
"Daily NRS score reduced gradually over the treatment period [ regression slope -0.052 ( 0.01 ) , 95 % CI -0.07 to -0.03 ] .",3
"Preliminary evidence suggests that the Kyrobak may be beneficial for short-term relief of non-specific , chronic LBP , particularly in participants with a moderate level of pain .",4
A longer treatment period may lead to a further reduction in pain .,4
"MBSR was safe ( no adverse events ) , with 0 % dropout and excellent adherence ( daily meditation average : 3411 minutes , range 16-50 minutes/day ) .",3
"Median class attendance from 9 classes ( including retreat day ) was 8 ( range [ 3 , 9 ] ) ; average class attendance was 6.7 2.5 .",3
"MBSR participants had 1.4 fewer migraines/month ( MBSR : 3.5 to 1.0 vs control : 1.2 to 0 migraines/month , 95 % confidence interval CI [ -4.6 , 1.8 ] , P = .38 ) , an effect that did not reach statistical significance in this pilot sample .",3
"Headaches were less severe , although not significantly so ( -1.3 points/headache on 0-10 scale , [ -2.3 , 0.09 ] , P = .053 ) and shorter ( -2.9 hours/headache , [ -4.6 , -0.02 ] , P = .043 ) vs control .",3
"Migraine Disability Assessment and Headache Impact Test-6 dropped in MBSR vs control ( -12.6 , [ -22.0 , -1.0 ] , P = .017 and -4.8 , [ -11.0 , -1.0 ] , P = .043 , respectively ) .",3
"Self-efficacy and mindfulness improved in MBSR vs control ( 13.2 [ 1.0 , 30.0 ] , P = .035 and 13.1 [ 3.0 , 26.0 ] , P = .035 respectively ) .",3
MBSR is safe and feasible for adults with migraines .,4
"Although the small sample size of this pilot trial did not provide power to detect statistically significant changes in migraine frequency or severity , secondary outcomes demonstrated this intervention had a beneficial effect on headache duration , disability , self-efficacy , and mindfulness .",4
Future studies with larger sample sizes are warranted to further evaluate this intervention for adults with migraines .,4
This study was prospectively registered ( ClinicalTrials.gov identifier NCT01545466 ) .,4
Distance uncorrected visual acuity was significantly better in the combination group than in the hyaluronate group 1 week and 1 month after LASIK .,3
Near uncorrected visual acuity was significantly better in the combination group than in the artificial tear and diquafosol groups 1 week and 1 month after LASIK .,3
Distance functional visual acuity improved significantly only in the combination group 1 month after LASIK .,3
The Schirmer value in the combination group was significantly higher than that in the hyaluronate group at 1 month after LASIK .,3
Subjective dry eye symptoms in the combination group improved significantly compared with those in the other groups 1 week after surgery .,3
Our results suggest that hyaluronate and diquafosol combination therapy is beneficial for early stabilization of visual performance and improvement of subjective dry eye symptoms in patients after LASIK .,4
"The results of this study will provide valuable information about the efficacy , acceptability and therefore the viability of delivering online interventions to families affected by chronic illnesses such as Type 1 diabetes .",4
Forty-four patients received piribedil ; 36 continued on either pramipexole or ropinirole .,3
"There was no difference in the primary end point reaction time of the TAP subtest vigilance between piribedil and the comparator ( 996 vs 954 milliseconds , P = 0.68 ) .",3
Piribedil reduced daytime sleepiness with lower Epworth Sleepiness Scale scores at the end of treatment compared with the comparator ( -4 vs -2 points ; P = 0.01 ) .,3
The median Unified Parkinson 's Disease Rating Scale III score at the end of treatment was comparable between the 2 groups .,3
Neuropsychological tests revealed no significant between-treatment differences .,3
A higher therapeutic effect and global improvement were shown by the Clinical Global Impression of piribedil-treated patients .,3
This study shows that switching from pramipexole or ropinirole to piribedil has no effect on the reaction time of the TAP subtest vigilance but upholds the same therapeutic motor effect and reduces daytime sleepiness to a clinically relevant degree in patients with excessive daytime sleepiness .,4
The study found significant improvement in acne scars after treatment with fractional bipolar RF and with a fractional erbium-doped glass device without a statistically significant difference between the two devices .,3
"The side effects of both devices were pain , transient facial erythema , and scab formation .",3
"The pain score with fractional erbium-doped glass was higher than that with fractional bipolar RF , but duration of scab shedding was shorter .",3
One case had postinflammatory hyperpigmentation on only the side treated with fractional erbium-doped glass .,3
Fractional bipolar RF and fractional erbium-doped glass have similar effectiveness for the treatment of atrophic acne scars .,4
Sixty-two of 66 subjects in the double-blind proceeded to the open-label extension .,3
Most subjects ( 95 % ) reported 1 adverse event ( AE ) ; only 3 subjects ( 4.8 % ) discontinued due to AEs .,3
AE incidence declined gradually over 52 weeks .,3
Serious AEs were reported by 23 % .,3
"LCIG-nave patients ( N = 29 ) showed a decrease in `` Off '' time and an increase in `` On '' time without troublesome dyskinesia ( change from baseline to final visit in mean [ SD ] hours = -2.34 [ 2.78 ] P < 0.001 and 2.19 [ 3.70 ] P = 0.005 , respectively ) , while continuing-LCIG patients ( N = 33 ) showed sustained `` Off '' time duration and further improvement in `` On '' time without troublesome dyskinesia ( -0.42 [ 2.67 ] P = 0.377 and 1.00 [ 2.58 ] P = 0.036 , respectively ) .",3
"The majority of patients in both groups ( LCIG-nave , continuing-LCIG , respectively ) were rated ` Much Improved ' or ` Very Much Improved ' at final visit on the Clinical Global Impression-Improvement scale ( 69.0 % , 69.7 % ) .",3
Continuing-LCIG patients continued to derive benefit from LCIG while the magnitude of improvement among LCIG-nave patients was similar to that observed for patients on LCIG in the preceding double-blind study .,4
The overall AE profile was consistent with previous phase 3 clinical trials involving the LCIG system .,4
AN was identified in any of the examined sites in 47.8 % of the participants .,3
Its prevalence increased from 41 % to 86 % from normal to obese anthropometric categories .,3
"AN occurred in 1-4 sites in 23.1 % , 10.8 % , 6.9 % and 7.1 % of cases , respectively .",3
The knuckles was the site with the highest prevalence of AN as an overall group ( 31.3 % ) and in the normal ( 24.9 % ) and overweight body mass index ( 46.4 % ) categories and there was a higher prevalence in the cases above the median in the normal body mass index category .,3
"In the obese group , AN was slightly more common in the neck but all sites had a very similar high prevalence .",3
"AN occurs with a high prevalence in Latin American youths , and its prevalence is much higher in a `` non-classical '' and ignored location where it is very easy to detect during physical examination : the knuckles .",4
It may also occur earlier in this location in the evolution to obesity .,4
"The presence of AN in the knuckles in any patient , even if they have a normal body mass index , might indicate the likelihood of an early clinical manifestation of insulin resistance and metabolic consequences .",4
"Both treatments increased fiber diameter and peak power , with WK treatment 5-fold more effective than MO in increasing type I fiber P0 .",3
WK effects on fiber diameter and force were 1.5-fold higher in slow fibers compared to fast fibers .,3
"In fast type II fibers , diameter and P0 increased similarly between treatments .",3
The increased power was entirely due to increased fiber size and force .,3
"In conclusion , T replacement effects were fiber-type dependent , restricted to increases in cell size , P0 , and peak power , and dependent on the paradigm selected ( WK vs MO ) .",4
"Higher levels of NT-proBNP and hs-cTnT before surgery were associated with older age , renal or cardiac dysfunction and EuroSCORE .",3
"NT-proBNP peaked on postoperative day 2 ( 2172 [ 1238-3758 ] ng/L , median [ Q1-Q3 ] ) , while hs-cTnT peaked at the end of surgery ( 373 [ 188-660 ] ng/L ) .",3
Fish oil supplementation did not alter the time course of the cardiac biomarkers ( P > 0.05 ) .,3
"Concentrations of NT-proBNP or hs-cTnT , on the morning of surgery , or changes in their level between morning of surgery and postsurgery , were not significantly associated with POAF after adjustment for clinical and surgical characteristics .",3
"Among patients undergoing cardiac surgery , NT-proBNP and hs-cTnT are related to clinical and surgical characteristics , have different perioperative time courses but are not independently associated with risk of POAF .",4
"From January 2011 to April 2014 , 220 pregnant women at 12-13 weeks of gestation were randomized at two Italian university hospitals , 110 to myo-inositol and 110 to placebo .",3
Most characteristics were similar between groups .,3
"The GDM rate was significantly reduced in the myo-inositol group compared with the control group , 14.0 % compared with 33.6 % , respectively ( P = .001 ; odds ratio 0.34 , 95 % confidence interval 0.17-0 .68 ) .",3
"Furthermore , women treated with myo-inositol showed a significantly greater reduction in the homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance compared with the control group , -1.03.1 compared with 0.11.8 ( P = .048 ) .",3
"Myo-inositol supplementation , started in the first trimester , in obese pregnant women seems to reduce the incidence in GDM through a reduction of insulin resistance .",4
The study findings will have potential implications for clinical practice by evaluating the implementation of specialized integrated treatment for comorbid anxiety and/or depression in an alcohol outpatient service .,4
"Complete abstinence was achieved by 5.5 % ( n = 11 ) of women in the nicotine patch group and 5.1 % ( n = 10 ) in the placebo patch group ( odds ratio 1.08 , 95 % confidence interval 0.45 to 2.60 ) .",3
"The median time to the first cigarette smoked after target quit day was 15 days in both groups ( interquartile range 13-18 in the nicotine patch group , 13-20 in the placebo patch group ) .",3
The point prevalence abstinence ranged from 8 % to 12.5 % in the nicotine patch group and 8 % to 9.5 % in the placebo patch group without statistically significant differences .,3
"The nicotine substitution rate did not differ from 100 % , and the self reported median compliance rate was 85 % ( interquartile range 56-99 % ) in the nicotine patch group and 83 % ( 56-95 % ) in the placebo patch group , assessed at 1016 visits .",3
The mean birth weight was 3065 g ( SE 44 g ) in the nicotine patch group and 3015 g ( SE 44 g ) in the placebo patch group ( P = 0.41 ) .,3
Diastolic blood pressure was significantly higher in the nicotine patch group than in the placebo patch group .,3
"The frequency of serious adverse events was similar between the groups , although more non-serious adverse reactions , mainly of skin , occurred in the nicotine patch group .",3
"The nicotine patch did not increase either smoking cessation rates or birth weights despite adjustment of nicotine dose to match levels attained when smoking , and higher than usual doses .",4
"Of the 101 patients randomized , 99 were included in the analysis ( low dose , n = 32 ; medium dose , n = 34 ; and high dose , n = 33 ) .",3
"Mean sitting BP decreased from baseline in the low - , medium - , and high-dose groups by 7.3 , 7.6 , and 6.7 mmHg , respectively , for SBP and 8.2 , 5.1 , and 6.7 mmHg , respectively , for DBP after 3 weeks .",3
No dose-response relationship was established by the slope analysis on SBP ( P = 0.75 ) or DBP ( P = 0.64 ) .,3
The BP-lowering effect was observed throughout the 2-year extension .,3
The incidence of AEs was low and comparable between groups .,3
"Hypertensive children aged 6 months to 6 years treated with losartan 0.1-0 .7 mg/kg per day had clinically significant decreases from baseline in SBP and DBP , yet no dose-response relationship was evident .",4
"Losartan , at a dosage up to 1.4 mg/kg per day , was well tolerated .",4
Intervention participation was 53.7 % in a hospital setting and 60.5 % in primary care settings .,3
ADR reporting in the intervention group increased by 65.4 % ( 95 % confidence interval [ CI ] : 8.2-153 .4 ) across the follow-up .,3
"The ADR reporting rate per 1,000 physicians/year in the intervention group rose from 28.1 to 39.6 following the intervention ( 51.7 and 27.4 in the first and second 4-month period , respectively ) .",3
"For the intervention group , relative risk ( RR ) was 2.31 ( 95 % CI : 1.46-3 .68 ) and 1.04 ( 95 % CI : 0.61-1 .77 ) in the first and second 4-month period , respectively adjusted to baseline values .",3
"There was an increase in unexpected ADR reporting ( RR 2.06 , 95 % CI 1.19-3 .55 ) .",3
Pharmacovigilance educational interventions that have proved effective can be successfully applied in different geographical areas .,4
A high baseline notification rate could account for the educational program having a moderate effect .,4
"Twenty implants ( 10 test , 10 control ) were placed in 20 patients ( 7 men , 13 women ) between the ages of 27 and 87 ( mean age , 52.6 years ) .",3
"At 1 year , all implants remained osseointegrated , with overall mean marginal bone changes of -0.01 mm and -0.14 mm for the test and control groups , respectively .",3
Mean facial gingival level change was significantly more pronounced in the control group ( -0.70 mm ) than in the test group ( -0.25 mm ) .,3
The modified Plaque Index scores showed that patients were able to maintain a good level of hygiene throughout the study .,3
"At 1 year , the Papilla Index indicated that more than 50 % papilla fill was observed in 75 % of the test sites and 80 % of the control sites .",3
"Within the limitations of this study , SCTG was shown to be beneficial in maintaining facial gingival level when performed in conjunction with IIPP procedures .",4

"During treatment , percent heavy drinking days ( naltrexone : mean = 21.60 , SD = 16.05 ; placebo : mean = 22.90 , SD = 13.20 ) ( P = .58 ) and percent days abstinent ( naltrexone : mean = 56.60 , SD = 22.52 ; placebo : mean = 62.50 , SD = 15.75 ) ( P = .39 ) did not differ by group .",3
"Naltrexone significantly reduced the number of drinks per drinking day ( naltrexone : mean = 4.90 , SD = 2.28 ; placebo : mean = 5.90 , SD = 2.51 ) ( P = .009 ) and percentage of drinking days with estimated BAC 0.08 g/dL ( naltrexone : mean = 35.4 , SD = 28.40 ; placebo : mean = 45.7 , SD = 26.80 ) ( P = .042 ) .",3
There were no serious adverse events .,3
Sleepiness was more common with naltrexone .,3
"Naltrexone did not reduce frequency of drinking or heavy drinking days , but reduced secondary measures of drinking intensity .",4
"While effects were modest , the risk-benefit ratio favors offering naltrexone to help young adult heavy drinkers reduce the amount of alcohol they drink .",4
A total of 17 patients ( 65.3 7.3 years ) were enrolled .,3
"SVGs harvested using the NT vs CON technique exhibited preserved intimal , medial and adventitial architecture .",3
"CON harvest was associated with greater medial Kruppel-like factor 4 transcript levels ( 0.26 0.05 vs 0.11 0.02 , P < 0.05 ) .",3
"CON samples had significantly lower medial serum response factor ( 0.53 0.11 vs 1.44 0.50 , P < 0.05 ) and myocardin ( 0.59 0.08 vs 1.33 0.33 , P < 0.05 ) transcript levels .",3
"MicroRNA-145 , an inhibitor of VSMC activation and differentiation , was higher in the NT vs CON samples ( 1.84 1.03 vs 0.50 0.19 , P < 0.05 ) .",3
"Leg assessment scores were worse in the NT legs at 3 months , but similar to CON scores at 12 months .",3
SVGs harvested using the ` NT ' technique exhibit an early molecular and morphological pattern consistent with decreased VSMC activation compared with CON harvesting .,4
Functional leg recovery was similar in both groups at 12 months .,4
Larger studies are required to corroborate these findings .,4
The Guided Application of Ventricular Catheters ( GAVCA ) trial compares the guided catheter positioning with the standard freehand technique of catheter placement in hydrocephalic patients .,4
"If superiority is shown , the standard technique may be changed with the advantage of a more reliable and safer positioning of the ventricular catheter with just a slight effort in time and pre-operative planning .",4
"PAR was lower after treatment with valsartan ( 11.49 0.69 % vs. 18.71 2.47 % , P < 0.001 ) , associated with more reduced plasma levels of COX-2 ( 76.94 7.07 U/L vs. 116.4 15.89 U/L , P < 0.001 ) and TXB 2 ( 1667 56.50 pg/ml vs. 2207 180.20 pg/ml ) ( all P < 0.001 ) .",3
"Plasma COX-2 and TXB 2 levels correlated significantly with PAR in overall patients ( r = 0.109 , P < 0.001 ) .",3
"During follow-up ( median , 18 months ) , there was a significantly lower thrombotic event rate in patients treated with valsartan ( 14.3 % vs. 32.8 % , P = 0.002 ) .",3
Relative expression of COX-2 and secretion of TXB 2 with concordant phosphorylation of p38MAPK and NF-kB were increased in HAECs when stimulated by Ang II ( 100 nmol/L ) but were significantly decreased by valsartan pretreatment ( 100 nmol/L ) .,3
AT 1 R antagonist valsartan decreases platelet activity by attenuating COX-2 / TXA 2 expression through p38MAPK and NF-kB pathways and reduces the occurrence of cardio-cerebral thrombotic events in elderly patients with hypertension .,4
"No differences in baseline characteristics , including serum hormone levels ( P > 0.05 ) , were found .",3
"Baseline mean ( SD ) Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale scores were 10.7 ( 8.6 ) and 9.2 ( 7.8 ) for testosterone and placebo , respectively ( P = 0.35 ) .",3
"After 12 months of treatment , measures of quality of life , self-esteem , and mood symptoms did not differ between treatment groups .",3
Serum testosterone levels achieved physiologic levels in the testosterone group and were significantly higher compared with placebo ( P < 0.001 ) .,3
Baseline testosterone levels were not associated with either adverse or beneficial clinical effects .,3
A 150-g testosterone patch achieves physiologic hormone levels in women with POI .,4
Our findings suggest that augmentation of standard estrogen/progestin therapy with physiologic testosterone therapy in young women with POI neither aggravates nor improves baseline reports of quality of life or self-esteem and had minimal effects on mood .,4
Other mechanisms might play a role in the altered mood accompanying this disorder .,4
"After multivariable adjustment , the presence of hospitalists was associated with lower probability of readmission for all 3 target conditions .",3
No significant associations for any of the target conditions were found in all-cause mortality models .,3
Hospitalists are already integral to the delivery of inpatient care at most institutions .,4
"This study , however , showed an association at the national level of the presence of hospitalists with an important and timely quality measure : reduction of readmission rates .",4
Future research is indicated to explore specific causation pathways for the impact of hospitalists on quality of care .,4
"Mean decrease in CCT was 105 m in FLEX-treated eyes and 106 m in SMILE-treated eyes ( P = .70 ) , which is equivalent to approximately 14 m/diopters corrected .",3
Mean central epithelial thickness increased 7 6 m in FLEX-treated eyes and 6 5 m in SMILE-treated eyes ( P = .64 ) .,3
Achieved mean flap/cap thickness was 4 6 m from the expected thickness in FLEX-treated eyes and 4 9 m in SMILE-treated eyes ( P = .37 ) .,3
CH was reduced 2.7 1.3 mm Hg in FLEX-treated eyes and 3.3 1.2 mm Hg in SMILE-treated eyes ( P = .08 ) .,3
CRF was reduced 4.5 1.2 mm Hg in FLEX-treated eyes and 4.6 1.2 mm Hg in SMILE-treated eyes ( P = .71 ) .,3
"CH and CRF were highly correlated with CCT , but not patient age .",3
"In this paired-eye study , the flap-based FLEX and cap-based SMILE resulted in almost identical changes in central corneal sublayer pachymetry and biomechanical properties for moderate to high myopia 6 months after treatment .",4
"One year after smoking cessation , the mean serum leptin change was +3.23 mg/l ( SD 4.89 ) in the control group and +1.25 mg/l ( SD 4.86 ) in the intervention group ( p of the difference < 0.05 ) .",3
"When adjusted for body fat levels , leptin was higher in the control group than in the intervention group ( p of the difference < 0.01 ) .",3
"The mean weight gain was +2.91 ( SD 6.66 ) Kg in the intervention and +3.33 ( SD 4.47 ) Kg in the control groups , respectively ( p not significant ) .",3
"Serum leptin levels significantly increased after smoking cessation , in spite of substantial weight gain .",4
"The leptin dynamic might be different in chronic tobacco users who quit smoking , and physical activity might impact the dynamic of leptin in such a situation .",4
Clinical trial registration number : NCT00521391 .,4
"This is the first study to test the impact of performance-based pricing and communications incentives in small food stores , an innovative strategy to encourage local wholesalers and storeowners to share responsibility in creating a healthier food supply by stocking , promoting , and reducing costs of healthier foods in their stores .",4
"Local food wholesalers were involved in a top-down , participatory approach to develop and implement an effective and sustainable program .",4
"This study will provide evidence on the effectiveness of price incentives and health communications , separately and combined , among a low-income urban U.S.",4
All airway adverse events ( AEs ) were of mild or moderate severity .,3
Symptomatic bronchospasm occurred in 53.8 % of subjects with asthma after inhaled loxapine and 11.5 % after placebo ; and in 19.2 % of COPD subjects after inhaled loxapine and 11.1 % after placebo .,3
Subjects required inhaled albuterol as follows : asthma : 53.8 % after inhaled loxapine and 11.5 % after placebo ; and COPD : 23.1 % after inhaled loxapine and 14.8 % after placebo .,3
"Respiratory signs/symptoms requiring treatment responded to rescue bronchodilator [ forced expiratory volume in 1sec ( FEV ( 1 ) ) return to within 10 % of baseline ] within 1hr in 11 of 15 events in asthma subjects and four of seven events in COPD subjects , the remainder by the last spirometry .",3
"In subjects with either asthma or COPD , FEV ( 1 ) decline and bronchospasm can occur following inhaled loxapine , but more frequently in asthmatic subjects .",4
Most subjects with bronchospasm responded to rescue bronchodilator within 1hr .,4
No treatment-related serious AE occurred .,4
"Although inhaled loxapine is contraindicated in patients with active airways disease per the current approved US labeling , these studies demonstrated that rescue bronchodilator mitigated the symptomatic bronchospasms that may occur in case of inadvertent use .",4
"One hundred and four subjects were analysed ( 59.6 % males , 42.3 % current smokers ) .",3
"Negative predictive values from microspirometry for airflow obstruction based on the fixed and LLN cut-off points were 94.4 % ( 95 % confidence interval ( CI ) , 86.4-98 .5 ) and 96.3 % ( 95 % CI , 88.2-99 .3 ) , respectively .",3
"In all , 18 % of positive microspirometry results were not confirmed by a post-BD FEV1/FVC < 0.70 and 44 % of tests were false positive compared with the LLN criterion for airflow obstruction .",3
Pre-bronchodilator microspirometry seems to be able to reliably preselect patients for further assessment of airflow obstruction by means of regular diagnostic spirometry .,4
"However , use of microspirometry alone would result in overestimation of airflow obstruction and should not replace regular spirometry when diagnosing COPD in primary care .",4
The Tai Chi subjects demonstrated a decreased ( faster ) Timed Up and Go and increased stride length and time spent in single limb support at the end of intervention as compared with baseline .,3
The functional balance training group demonstrated a significant increase in ankle plantar flexor power and near significant decreases in step width and step width variability .,3
No changes in the education-only control group were observed .,3
"Older patients with distal symmetric polyneuropathy may benefit from Tai Chi and/or functional balance training , with the former improving functional mobility and gait and the latter possibly improving trunk stabilization and forward progression ( Lythgo N , Cofr LE : Relationship between ankle plantar flexor power and EMG muscle activity during gait .",4

Whether these laudable changes can be maintained or translate into decreased risk for falls and fall-related injuries is unknown .,4
"Altogether 112 patients were included , 56 in each group.The stents were successfully deployed in all patients .",3
"Satisfactory jaundice control was achieved in 49 cases in the pcARMS group , compared with 47 in the ucSEMS group ( P = 0.135 ) .",3
"Fewer patients experienced cholangitis in the pcARMS group than in the ucSEMS group ( 10 vs. 21 patients ; P = 0.035 ) , and the frequency of episodes was less ( P = 0.022 ) .",3
"Respectively , 17 and 29 stent dysfunctions before death were observed in the pcARMS and ucSEMS groups ( P = 0.051 ) and the median stent patency was 13.0 ( standard deviation [ SD ] 3.4 ) and 10.0 ( 1.2 ) months , respectively ( P = 0.044 ) .",3
"At final follow-up , in January 2013 , 50/52 and 52/55 patients had died and no difference in median survival was seen between the two groups ( 8.0 vs. 9.0 months , P = 0.56 ) .",3
"Stenting with pcARMS compared with standard ucSEMS reduces risk of ascending cholangitis and has longer stent patency , but does not increase patient survival .",4

"At a mean follow-up time of 4.0 ( SD , 1.7 ) years , the primary outcome event rates were not significantly different between the CCTA and the control groups ( 6.2 % [ 28 events ] vs 7.6 % [ 34 events ] ; hazard ratio , 0.80 [ 95 % CI , 0.49-1 .32 ] ; P = .38 ) .",3
"The incidence of the composite secondary end point of ischemic major adverse cardiovascular events also did not differ between groups ( 4.4 % [ 20 events ] vs 3.8 % [ 17 events ] ; hazard ratio , 1.15 [ 95 % CI , 0.60-2 .19 ] ; P = .68 ) .",3
"Among asymptomatic patients with type 1 or type 2 diabetes , use of CCTA to screen for CAD did not reduce the composite rate of all-cause mortality , nonfatal MI , or unstable angina requiring hospitalization at 4 years .",4
These findings do not support CCTA screening in this population .,4
"The supposedly low-risk group had a total mortality of one-third of other groups , such as : men with hypertension , diabetes or hypercholesterolemia , or those whom participated in the two trials .",3
"Between these latter groups , we found 2-5 years of difference in their median survival time , but their absolute risk stayed at rather high levels through all the years , with the median remaining a lifetime that was 3-8 years shorter than the men whom were free of known cardiovascular disease , diabetes or hypertension .",3
"The long-term preventive effects on total mortality seem large , if the levels of the classical risk factors of blood pressure , total cholesterol and glucose can be adequately controlled , concurrently with a non-smoking behavior .",4
The study indicated that non-smoking and a low total cholesterol value were the most important contributors to extended survival .,4
A total of 1836 patients were assigned to the 4-month regimen ( experimental group ) or the standard regimen ( control group ) .,3
Baseline characteristics were well balanced between the groups .,3
"At 24 months after the end of treatment , the adjusted difference in the risk of an unfavorable outcome ( experimental group [ 21.0 % ] minus control group [ 17.2 % ] ) in the modified intention-to-treat population ( 1356 patients ) was 3.5 percentage points ( 95 % confidence interval , -0.7 to 7.7 ) .",3
"There was heterogeneity across countries ( P = 0.02 for interaction , with differences in the rate of an unfavorable outcome ranging from -5.4 percentage points in Guinea to 12.3 percentage points in Senegal ) and in baseline cavitary status ( P = 0.04 for interaction ) and body-mass index ( P = 0.10 for interaction ) .",3
"The standard regimen , as compared with the 4-month regimen , was associated with a higher dropout rate during treatment ( 5.0 % vs. 2.7 % ) and more treatment failures ( 2.4 % vs. 1.7 % ) but fewer recurrences ( 7.1 % vs. 14.6 % ) .",3
There was no evidence of increased risks of prolongation of the QT interval or dysglycemia with the 4-month regimen .,3
Noninferiority of the 4-month regimen to the standard regimen with respect to the primary efficacy end point was not shown .,4

"Bednet use , among the 560 households in the study , increased from 6 to 91 % after 6 months .",3
Coverage efficiency increased from 1.29 to 1.56 children covered per bednet owned .,3
"In multivariable analysis , having a child under 5 years of age was the only variable associated with bednet use ( OR 9.10 ; p = 0.001 ) , yielding a 99 % likelihood of using a bednet ( 95 % CI 96.4 to 99.9 % ) versus 82 % ( 95 % CI 72.2 to 88.4 % ) in households without young children .",3
This free bednet distribution program achieved high levels of adherence after 6 months .,4
"Household presence of children was associated with bednet use , but not household income or education , suggesting that distribution to priority groups may help overcome traditional barriers to adoption in some settings .",4
"Two hundred and thirteen participants ( 50 % women ; mean age : 46 years , mean body mass index : 37 ) were included : 182 returned for 18-month follow-up , of whom 172 completed the HRQOL questionnaire .",3
HRQOL was reduced with clinical significance compared with general Norwegians .,3
The mean changes in HRQOL from the baseline to the follow-up were not of clinical importance .,3
"However , one out of three individuals achieved a moderate or large clinical improvement in HRQOL .",3
"The best determinant for improved HRQOL was obtained for a composite , clinically significant lifestyle change , i.e. both a weight reduction of at least 5 % and an improvement in exercise capacity of at least 10 % , which was associated with an improvement in five out of the eight SF-36 domains .",3
Subjects at risk of type 2 diabetes report a clinically important reduction in HRQOL compared with general Norwegians .,4
The best predictor of improved HRQOL was a small weight loss combined with a small improvement in aerobic capacity .,4
"After treatment , the only variable that differed between the groups was the physical functioning domain of the SF-36 in the group that received conventional physical therapy .",3
"A significant difference was observed between both groups before and after treatment in terms of the following Fugl-Meyer scale items : passive movement and pain , motor function of the upper limbs ( ULs ) , and balance .",3
The CPT group also showed a significant difference with regard to their UL and lower limb ( LL ) coordination .,3
"The SF-36 scale analysis revealed a significant difference within both groups with regard to the following domains : physical functioning , role limitation due to physical aspects , vitality , and role limitation due to emotional aspects .",3
The NW group also exhibited a significant difference in the mental health domain .,3
The results indicate that both approaches improved the patients ' performance in a similar manner .,3
"Virtual rehabilitation using the Nintendo Wii and CPT both effectively treat post-stroke hemiparetic patients by improving passive movement and pain scores , motor function of the upper limb , balance , physical functioning , vitality , and the physical and emotional aspects of role functioning .",4
There was no differential change over time between the BMS and control groups in self-reported depression or anxiety symptoms .,3
"However , suicidal ideation appeared to be reduced in the psychotherapy group .",3
"Changes in diurnal cortisol patterns were also significantly different in group time interactions , in favor of BMS group .",3
Psychotherapy likely provides improvements in psychobiological stress responses and decreases the occurrence of suicidal ideation in patients with AD .,4
A total of 173 participants in study A and 108 participants in study B were included in the analysis .,3
A linear mixed model with 2 changepoints allowed all available results to be accounted for .,3
Predictions based on this model indicated that 98 % ( 95 % CI : 94-100 % ) of participants in study A and 97 % ( 95 % CI : 94-100 % ) of participants in study B will remain seropositive 25 years after receiving the first vaccine dose .,3
Other models using part of the data provided consistent results : 95 % of the participants was projected to remain seropositive for 25 years .,3
"This analysis , using previously used and newly selected model structures , was consistent with former estimates of seropositivity rates 95 % for at least 25 years .",4
"There was no significant differences between the two groups in terms of age , gender , indication for thyroidectomy , thyroid gland weight and diameter , histopathologic diagnosis , preoperative and postoperative serum calcium levels , postoperative complications and reoperative thyroid surgery , time of operation and amount of drainage .",3
"The ultrasonic scalpel and the Ligasure ares safe , effective , useful , and time-saving alternative to the traditional suture ligation technique for thyroid surgery .",4
"They simplified total thyroidectomy , eliminating the need for clamp-and-tie maneuvers while achieving efficient hemostasis .",4
"Ten minutes after use of the drug or placebo , improvements in maximum nasal airflow were seen in the oxymetazoline group ( P < 0.05 ) .",3
"However , exercise tests showed improvements in both groups ( P < 0.05 ) .",3
"After exertion , there was no difference between the two groups in maximum nasal airflow ( P > 0.05 ) .",3
"There were no differences between groups in oxygen consumption , rate of perceived exertion , respiratory exchange ratio , ventilation , or ventilatory equivalents for oxygen .",3
"Oxymetazoline increased nasal airflow in patients with turbinate hypertrophy , but this change did not translate into gains in physical exercise parameters or perceived exertion .",4
Clinical data was collected on 35 subjects who completed the study .,3
"There was a decline in NTX-telopeptides in the alendronate group ( P = .006 ) , but no significant difference in osteocalcin between groups .",3
"The alendronate group had an increase in areal BMD in normal bone at the lumbar spine ( P = .006 ) , and in predetermined regions of FD ( P < .001 ) .",3
"There were no significant differences in pain scores , skeletal disease burden scores , or functional parameters between the groups .",3
"Alendronate treatment led to a reduction in the bone resorption marker NTX-telopeptides , and improvement in aBMD , but no significant effect on serum osteocalcin , pain , or functional parameters .",4
The mean time to readiness for discharge ( and standard deviation ) was 2.4 0.7 days ( PAI ) compared with 2.3 0.8 days ( PCEA ) ( p = 0.86 ) .,3
The mean length of stay was 3.0 0.8 days ( PAI ) compared with 3.1 0.7 days ( PCEA ) ( p = 0.46 ) .,3
"A significant mean difference in pain score of 0.74 with ambulation ( p = 0.01 ; 95 % confidence interval [ CI ] , 0.18 to 1.31 ) and 0.80 during physical therapy ( p = 0.03 ; 95 % CI , 0.09 to 1.51 ) favored the PCEA group .",3
The mean opioid consumption ( oral morphine equivalents in milligrams ) was significantly higher in the PAI group on postoperative day 0 ( 43 21 compared with 28 23 ; p = 0.002 ) and postoperative days 0 through 2 ( 136 59 compared with 90 79 ; p = 0.004 ) .,3
"Opioid-Related Symptom Distress Scale ( ORSDS ) composite scores for severity and bothersomeness as well as scores for nausea , vomiting , and itchiness were significantly higher in the PCEA group ( p < 0.05 ) .",3
Quality of Recovery-40 scores and patient satisfaction were similar .,3
PAI did not decrease the time to discharge and was associated with higher pain scores and greater opioid consumption but lower ORSDS scores compared with PCEA .,4
The choice for analgesic regimen may depend on a particular patient 's threshold for pain and the potential side effects .,4
"In the first month , the mean pain intensity measured through VAS was 30.44.0 and 55.05.7 mm in skeletonized and pedicle group , respectively .",3
The pedicled group had significantly higher scores measured by all three scales at both one - and three-month intervals ( p-values < 0.0001 ) .,3
Our results indicate that skeletonization of ITA significantly reduces postcoronary artery bypass graft surgery pain at both one - and three-month intervals .,4
Long-term clinical trials involving larger sample sizes should be conducted to fully confirm the benefits of the skeletonization technique .,4
"Six months after initiation of SIT , we recorded a reduction in cell surface CD40L expression in the CD4 + T-cell population and a shift in the cytokine production profile ( decrease in IL-4-producing CD4 + T cells and increase in IFN-gamma , IL-10 , and TGF-beta1 ) .",3
These changes persisted after 12 months .,3
"Simultaneously , a clinical improvement was observed .",3
SIT-induced clinical improvement is the result of immunological modifications such as a reduction in CD40L expression on CD4 cells and alteration in the cytokine production profile .,4
Participants ( n = 140 ) were 29.76.6 years old and smoked 12.65.8 cigarettes per day .,3
"Compared to the F phase , the L phase was associated with a greater increase in stimulation ( 7.22.2 vs. 14.42.3 , p = 0.01 , respectively ) and greater decrease in urge to smoke ( -13.62.3 vs. -21.12.5 , p = 0.02 , respectively ) after the first dose of nicotine .",3
No other significant differences were observed .,3
"Out of 13 total measures examined at two different time points , we observed only two significant menstrual phase differences in the subjective response to nicotine .",4
"Therefore , these data do not provide strong evidence for a menstrual phase difference in the subjective response to nicotine .",4
Additional research is needed to confirm this relationship and explore how non-nicotine smoking reinforcements ( such as sensory sensations ) may vary by menstrual phase .,4
The mean patient age at surgery was 10.45 months6 .22 ( SD ) in the study group ( 31 eyes ) and 10.06.15 months in the control group ( 29 eyes ) ( P = .779 ) .,3
"In both groups , the mean IOP and CCT did not change significantly postoperatively ( study group P = .922 and P = .149 , respectively ; control group P = .483 and P = .416 , respectively ) .",3
The groups had similar incidences of cell deposits ( P = .517 ) and posterior synechiae ( P = .247 ) .,3
No eye developed visual axis obscuration or had additional surgical procedures .,3
All eyes had a clinically centered IOL .,3
"One year postoperatively , the outcomes were similar with intraoperative intracameral triamcinolone injection and postoperative oral prednisolone for modulating inflammation after congenital cataract surgery .",4
"In the placebo group , participants with a high homocysteine level ( n = 588 ) had a 1.8 higher risk ( 95 % confidence interval ( CI ) = 1.2-2 .5 , P = .001 ) of fatal and nonfatal CHD than those with a low homocysteine level ( n = 597 ) .",3
"The absolute risk reduction in fatal and nonfatal CHD with pravastatin treatment was 1.6 % ( 95 % CI = -1.6 to 4.7 % ) in the low homocysteine group and 6.7 % ( 95 % CI = 2.7-10 .7 % ) in the high homocysteine group ( difference 5.2 % , 95 % CI = 0.11-10 .3 , P = .046 ) .",3
"Therefore , the number needed to treat ( NNT ) with pravastatin for 3.2 years for benefit related to fatal and nonfatal CHD events was 14.8 ( 95 % CI = 9.3-36 .6 ) for high homocysteine and 64.5 ( 95 % CI = 21.4 - ) for low homocysteine .",3
"In older persons at risk of CVD , those with high homocysteine are at highest risk for fatal and nonfatal CHD .",4
"With pravastatin treatment , this group has the highest absolute risk reduction and the lowest NNT to prevent fatal and nonfatal CHD .",4
"With IQ3 .75 % , the median number of lesions increased from 10 at baseline to an Lmax of 22 .",3
The median absolute reduction in lesions to study end was 18 from Lmax versus 7 from baseline .,3
The median percentage reduction in AK lesions to study end was 92.2 % from Lmax compared with 81.8 % from baseline .,3
The reduction in lesion count from Lmax is a novel efficacy parameter that should become the new way of evaluating field-directed AK therapies since it enables their efficacy against both clinical and subclinical lesions to be accurately determined .,4
"Together , the Lmax concept and IQ3 .75 % represent a new approach for the management of AK across a large sun-exposed field .",4
260 Participants completed the IWPQ at both baseline and 12 months of follow-up .,3
"For the IWPQ scales , 23 % , 15 % , and 38 % , respectively , of the hypotheses could be confirmed .",3
"In general , the correlations between change scores were weaker than expected .",3
"Nevertheless , at least 85 % of the correlations were in the expected direction .",3
"Based on results of the current study , no firm conclusions can be drawn about the responsiveness of the IWPQ .",4
Several reasons may account for the weaker than expected correlations .,4
"Future research on the IWPQ 's responsiveness should be conducted , preferably in other populations and intervention studies , where greater changes over time can be expected .",4
Significant differences in healing process were observed at day 5 and continued throughout the entire study period ( P < .00001 ) .,3
"At 25 days , mean percent reduction in wound area was 93.5 % in group PG and 13.2 % in group C ( P < .00001 ) .",3
"Appropriately prepared autologous PG , an inexpensive , readily available blood derivative , applied topically results in more rapid healing of chronic non-healing decubital ulcers in dogs than those treated by use of paraffin-impregnated gauzes .",4
The treatment effect on OS differed between cohorts .,3
Non-significant OS trends favoured BEV-PAC in the TNBC cohort and BEV-CAP in the low-risk HR + cohort .,3
"In all three cohorts , there was a non-significant PFS trend favouring BEV-PAC .",3
Grade 3 adverse events were consistently less common with BEV-CAP .,3
"A simple risk factor index may help in selecting bevacizumab-containing regimens , balancing outcome , safety profile and patient preference .",4
Final OS results are expected in 2015 ( ClinicalTrials.gov NCT00600340 ) .,4
The use of omega-3 supplementation for eight weeks led to significant increase in serum HDL level compared with the group treated with vitamin E or placebo group .,3
"In this regard , no significant correlations were found between the change in VEGF and baseline levels of other markers including anthropometric indices and serum lipids .",3
Omega-3 could significantly reduce VEGF with the presence of other baseline variables ( Beta = -12.55 ; P = 0.012 ) .,3
"The administration of omega-3 can effectively improve endothelial function in adolescents with metabolic syndrome by reducing the level of serum VEGF , as a major index for atherosclerosis progression and endothelial destabilization .",4
Omega-3 can be proposed as a VEGF antagonist for improving endothelial function in metabolic syndrome .,4
The clinical implications of our findings should be assessed in future studies .,4
"Of 258 extension-phase patients , 153 ( 59.3 % ) completed 5 years of treatment .",3
"Hemoglobin A1c levels were significantly and durably reduced from baseline ( least-squares mean , -1.6 % ; 95 % CI , -1.8 % to -1.4 % ; vs -1.9 % for exenatide once weekly at week 30 ) , and 65 ( 43.9 % ) of 148 patients achieved hemoglobin A1c levels of less than 7.0 % .",3
"Significant improvements in fasting plasma glucose level ( -28.8 mg/dL ; 95 % CI , -36.2 to -21.5 mg/dL ) , weight ( -3.0 kg ; 95 % CI , -4.6 to -1.3 kg ) , lipids , and diastolic blood pressure were observed , with minimal heart rate increase .",3
Frequencies of nausea and injection-site reactions or nodules were decreased vs the initial 30-week controlled phase .,3
"Minor hypoglycemia occurred predominantly with sulfonylurea use , and no major hypoglycemia or new safety signals were observed .",3
"Long-term once weekly exenatide treatment was generally well tolerated with sustained glycemic improvement , weight reduction , and improved markers of cardiovascular risk in patients with type 2 diabetes .",4
Baseline characteristics of the two groups were comparable .,3
"Single-port and multi-port laparoscopies were successfully completed in all but one patient ( 1/19 , 5.3 % ) who required conversion from a single-port to a multi-port procedure .",3
The two groups had similar mean operative times and volumes of intraoperative blood loss .,3
There were no clinically significant postoperative complications or deaths .,3
The single-port group had a significantly shorter postoperative hospitalization than the multi-port group ( 2.5 1.7 vs. 4.0 2.1 days ; p < 0.05 ) .,3
"Single-port laparoscopic LLLS is a technically feasible , effective , safe alternative to multi-port laparoscopy for the treatment of benign liver diseases in cautiously selected patients .",4
SG participants lost significantly more weight than LG participants at Month 6 ( -6.5 vs. -3.2 kg ; p = 0.03 ) and Month 12 ( -7.0 vs. -1.7 kg ; p < 0.002 ) .,3
"SG participants reported better treatment engagement and self-monitoring adherence at Months 6 and 12 , ps < 0.04 , with adherence fully mediating the relationship between group size and weight loss .",3
Receiving obesity treatment in smaller groups may promote greater weight loss and weight loss maintenance .,4
This effect may be due to improved adherence facilitated by SG interactions .,4
These novel findings suggest that the perceived efficiency of delivering behavioral weight loss treatment to LGs should be balanced against the potentially better outcomes achieved by a SG approach .,4
"Mean scores of oral assessment tool increased according to days in all groups , however , this increase was found to be statistically insignificant ( p > 005 ) .",3
Mean scores of the patients in saline solution group were seen to be lower than those of the other groups .,3
"When inter-group comparison of days was done , the difference between oral assessment scores was found to be statistically significant ( p = 0000 ) .",3
"It was found that there was no difference between patient groups receiving saline solution , sodium bicarbonate and 02 % chlorhexidine for mouth care in terms of oral mucous membrane integrity ; oral mucosa of all patients was found to be mildly dysfunctioning .",4
It is thought that standardized protocols for oral hygiene developed in the light of the findings of randomized controlled trials may improve the oral health in critically ill patients .,4
"Four thousand , eight hundred and seventy-eight patients were divided into three categories : no history of angina and no chest pain at baseline ( Group A ; n = 1240 ) , past history of angina but no chest pain at baseline ( Group B ; n = 1353 ) and both a history of angina and chest pain at baseline ( Group C ; n = 2285 ) .",3
Outcomes were examined using Kaplan-Meier and Cox regression survival analysis .,3
"Compared with Group A , Group C had a higher risk of non-fatal myocardial infarction or unstable angina ( HR : 2.36 , 1.54-3 .61 ; P < 0.001 ) , this composite plus coronary revascularization ( HR : 2.54 , 1.76-3 .68 ; P < 0.001 ) , as well as HF hospitalization ( HR : 1.35 , 1.13-1 .63 ; P = 0.001 ) , over a median follow-up period of 33 months .",3
There was no difference in cardiovascular or all-cause mortality .,3
Group B had a smaller increase in risk of coronary events but not of heart failure hospitalization .,3
Patients with HF-REF and ongoing angina are at an increased risk of acute coronary syndrome and HF hospitalization .,4
Whether these patients would benefit from more aggressive medical therapy or percutaneous revascularization is not known and merits further investigation .,4
"Treatment with Armolipid Plus led to a significant reduction of total cholesterol ( -12.8 % ) and low-density lipoprotein-cholesterol ( -21.1 % ) , similar to pravastatin ( -16 % and -22.6 % , respectively ) , and an increase of high-density lipoprotein-cholesterol ( 4.8 % ) .",3
"Armolipid Plus improved the leptin-to-adiponectin ratio , whereas adiponectin levels were unchanged .",3
These results indicate that this nutraceutical approach shows a lipid-lowering activity comparable to pravastatin treatment .,4
"Hence , it may be a safe and useful option , especially in conditions of moderate cardiovascular risk , in which a pharmacologic intervention may not be appropriate .",4
The primary analysis included 121 patients receiving the stepped-care intervention and 120 patients receiving usual care .,3
"At 9 months , the mean decrease from baseline in the Roland Morris Disability Scale score was 1.7 ( 95 % CI , -2.6 to -0.9 ) points in the usual care group and 3.7 ( 95 % CI , -4.5 to -2.8 ) points in the intervention group ( between-group difference , -1.9 [ 95 % CI , -3.2 to -0.7 ] points ; P = .002 ) .",3
"The mean decrease from baseline in the Pain Interference subscale score of the Brief Pain Inventory was 0.9 points in the usual care group and 1.7 points in the intervention group ( between-group difference , -0.8 [ 95 % CI , -1.3 to -0.3 ] points ; P = .003 ) .",3
"The Graded Chronic Pain Scale severity score was reduced by 4.5 points in the usual care group and 11.1 points in the intervention group ( between-group difference , -6.6 [ 95 % CI , -10.5 to -2.7 ] points ; P = .001 ) .",3
"A stepped-care intervention that combined analgesics , self-management strategies , and brief cognitive behavioral therapy resulted in statistically significant reductions in pain-related disability , pain interference , and pain severity in veterans with chronic musculoskeletal pain .",4
"The mean change in serum phosphate was -1.29 mg/dl ( 95 % confidence interval , -1.63 to -0.96 mg/dl ) in the ferric citrate hydrate group and 0.06 mg/dl ( 95 % confidence interval , -0.20 to 0.31 mg/dl ) in the placebo group ( P < 0.001 for difference between groups ) .",3
The percentage of patients achieving target serum phosphate levels was 64.9 % in the ferric citrate hydrate group and 6.9 % in the placebo group ( P < 0.001 ) .,3
"Fibroblast growth factor-23 concentrations were significantly lower in patients treated with ferric citrate hydrate versus placebo ( change from baseline [ median ] , -142.0 versus 67.0 pg/ml ; P < 0.001 ) .",3
"Ferric citrate hydrate significantly increased serum iron , ferritin , and transferrin saturation compared with placebo ( P = 0.001 or P < 0.001 ) .",3
Five patients discontinued active treatment because of treatment-emergent adverse events with ferric citrate hydrate treatment versus one patient with placebo .,3
"Overall , adverse drug reactions were similar in patients receiving ferric citrate hydrate or placebo , with gastrointestinal disorders occurring in 30.0 % of ferric citrate hydrate patients and 26.7 % of patients receiving placebo .",3
"In patients with nondialysis-dependent CKD , 12-week treatment with ferric citrate hydrate resulted in significant reductions in serum phosphate and fibroblast growth factor-23 while simultaneously increasing serum iron parameters .",4
An interim analysis ( performed after 15 subjects completed the blinded phase ) revealed that 29 % ( 4 of 14 ) of subjects had a 10 % increase in LVESV after 6 months of sildenafil compared to 13 % ( 1 of 8 ) of subjects receiving placebo .,3
Subjects with LVESV > 120ml at baseline were more likely to worsen at 12 months regardless of treatment assignment ( p = 0.035 ) .,3
"Due to the higher number of subjects worsening on sildenafil , the data and safety monitoring board recommended early termination of the study .",3
There were no statistically significant differences in outcome measures between treatment arms .,3
"Due to the small sample size , comparisons between groups must be interpreted with caution .",4
"However , this trial suggests that sildenafil is unlikely to improve cardiac function in adults with DBMD .",4
"Concerning nightmare frequency , a significant reduction was found in both groups after the ten-week-study and at the follow-up ( Wilcoxon test : P 0.05 ) .",3
Significant reduction in dream recall frequency could only be observed in the GTG ( Wilcoxon test : P 0.05 ) .,3
"For subjects having succeeded in learning lucid dreaming , reduction was sooner and higher .",3
"Sleep quality improved for both groups at the follow-up ( P 0.05 , Wilcoxon test ) .",3
Only the LDG showed significant improvement at the end of therapy ( P 0.05 ) .,3
"Lucid dreaming , in combination with Gestalt therapy , is a potent technique to reduce nightmare frequency and improve the subjective quality of sleep .",4
"Overall 3205 students in 2007 , and 2155 students in 2008 year from 11 high schools participated .",3
A statistically significant behavior change was observed for the use of sunglasses in 2007 -- the number of students using them increased from 41.6 % to 45.6 % ( p < 0.05 ) .,3
"There were no significant changes in other ways of protection i.e. sunscreen use , protective clothes or staying in shade .",3
"Educational program had an impact , but broader activities involving schools , local communities and media are needed for significant changes in sun behavior and attitude .",4
The trial was terminated early for futility based on results of a planned interim analysis of participants enrolled at least 5 years prior to the date of the analysis ( n = 955 ) .,3
The median follow-up time was 4 years .,3
"Of the 955 participants , the mean of the summed ranks for placebo was 2360 ( 95 % CI , 2249-2470 ) and for creatine was 2414 ( 95 % CI , 2304-2524 ) .",3
The global statistical test yielded t1865 .8 = -0.75 ( 2-sided P = .45 ) .,3
There were no detectable differences ( P < .01 to partially adjust for multiple comparisons ) in adverse and serious adverse events by body system .,3
"Among patients with early and treated Parkinson disease , treatment with creatine monohydrate for at least 5 years , compared with placebo did not improve clinical outcomes .",4
These findings do not support the use of creatine monohydrate in patients with Parkinson disease .,4
We recruited 196 participants in two months .,3
"SmartQuit participants opened their application an average of 37.2 times , as compared to 15.2 times for QuitGuide participants ( p < 0001 ) .",3
The overall quit rates were 13 % in SmartQuit vs. 8 % in QuitGuide ( OR = 2.7 ; 95 % CI = 0.8-10 .3 ) .,3
"Consistent with ACT 's theory of change , among those scoring low ( below the median ) on acceptance of cravings at baseline ( n = 88 ) , the quit rates were 15 % in SmartQuit vs. 8 % in QuitGuide ( OR = 2.9 ; 95 % CI = 0.6-20 .7 ) .",3
ACT is feasible to deliver by smartphone application and shows higher engagement and promising quit rates compared to an application that follows US Clinical Practice Guidelines .,4
"As results were limited by the pilot design ( e.g. , small sample ) , a full-scale efficacy trial is now needed .",4
"At 7 years of follow-up after initial enrollment , the cumulative rate of death from any cause among patients with left bundle-branch block was 18 % among patients randomly assigned to CRT-D , as compared with 29 % among those randomly assigned to defibrillator therapy alone ( adjusted hazard ratio in the CRT-D group , 0.59 ; 95 % confidence interval [ CI ] , 0.43 to 0.80 ; P < 0.001 ) .",3
"The long-term survival benefit of CRT-D in patients with left bundle-branch block did not differ significantly according to sex , cause of cardiomyopathy , or QRS duration .",3
"In contrast , CRT-D was not associated with any clinical benefit and possibly with harm in patients without left bundle-branch block ( adjusted hazard ratio for death from any cause , 1.57 ; 95 % CI , 1.03 to 2.39 ; P = 0.04 ; P < 0.001 for interaction of treatment with QRS morphologic findings ) .",3
"Our findings indicate that in patients with mild heart-failure symptoms , left ventricular dysfunction , and left bundle-branch block , early intervention with CRT-D was associated with a significant long-term survival benefit .",4
"( Funded by Boston Scientific ; ClinicalTrials.gov numbers , NCT00180271 , NCT01294449 , and NCT02060110 . )",4
"At each survey , most age groups and cohorts had MDA coverage of more than 80 % and showed decreased TF prevalence after every MDA .",3
"One cohort had consistently lower coverage , higher-than-expected TF and infection at ages 6 and 7 , and elevated risk of TF at age 7 relative to the preceding cohort in spite of receiving one additional MDA ( odds ratio 2.3 , 95 % confidence interval 1.0-5 .2 ) .",3
"Cohorts aged 1 or older at baseline generally showed reductions in TF and infection after each MDA , whereas younger cohorts showed decreased infection but increased TF over time .",3
Successive cohorts of never-treated children younger than 1 year showed sequential TF and infection reductions with each MDA ( P < 0.001 ) .,3
Multiple MDAs significantly reduce trachoma prevalence and appear to increasingly protect children born into these communities .,4
"The youngest children show declining/stable rates of infection but increasing rates of trachoma , which may reflect longer duration of clinical signs .",4
"Three months after surgery , patients in the tamoxifen group had a smaller total passive extension deficit and higher satisfaction compared with the placebo group .",3
This positive effect was lost over the two years following cessation of the medication .,3
This study demonstrated that the short-term outcome of Dupuytren disease treatment could be influenced by use of tamoxifen as a neoadjuvant from six weeks prior to three months after subtotal fasciectomy in patients with a strong predisposition toward fibrosis .,4
"However , the beneficial effect disappeared within two years after surgery , with worsening of the contractures after the medication was discontinued .",4
"Thus , tamoxifen may have a short-term effect on the outcome of surgery for Dupuytren disease .",4
"Patients were recruited between June 21 , 2007 , and Dec 19 , 2013 .",3
Complete 30-day data was available for all 7507 patients randomly assigned to methylprednisolone ( n = 3755 ) and to placebo ( n = 3752 ) .,3
"Methylprednisolone , compared with placebo , did not reduce the risk of death at 30 days ( 154 [ 4 % ] vs 177 [ 5 % ] patients ; relative risk [ RR ] 087 , 95 % CI 070-107 , p = 019 ) or the risk of death or major morbidity ( 909 [ 24 % ] vs 885 [ 24 % ] ; RR 103 , 95 % CI 095-111 , p = 052 ) .",3
"The most common safety outcomes in the methylprednisolone and placebo group were infection ( 465 [ 12 % ] vs 493 [ 13 % ] ) , surgical site infection ( 151 [ 4 % ] vs 151 [ 4 % ] ) , and delirium ( 295 [ 8 % ] vs 289 [ 8 % ] ) .",3
Methylprednisolone did not have a significant effect on mortality or major morbidity after cardiac surgery with cardiopulmonary bypass .,4
The SIRS trial does not support the routine use of methylprednisolone for patients undergoing cardiopulmonary bypass .,4
The concentration of cTnI was significantly lower in the Group LIDO and Group Combined than the control group on POD # 2 .,3
"The concentration of CK-MB was significantly lower in the Group LIDO and Group Combined compared to the control group on POD # 1 and # 2 [ CK-MB on POD # 1 : 7.67 ( 5.78-11 .92 ) vs. 7.18 ( 5.01-11 .72 ) vs. 13.19 ( 6.85-23 .87 ) in the Group LIDO , combined and control , respectively , Group LIDO vs. control : p = 0.003 , Group Combined vs. control : p = 0.015 ] .",3
The AUC of CK-MB was significantly lower in the Group LIDO and Group Combined than the control group .,3
"However , clinical variables including complication rate , ICU stay and one-year mortality were not different .",3
"Lidocaine infused at 2 mg/kg/h , but not dexmedetomidine infused at 0.3-0 .7 g/kg/h reduced postoperative myocardial injury marker levels compared with the control group .",4
"However , no other clinical benefits were observed .",4
"At baseline , there was a significant correlation between BIS and bromide dilution-derived estimates for ECW , and DXA for FM and FFM ( P < 0.001 ) .",3
"ECW by BIS was 3.5 8.1 % lower compared with bromide dilution , while FM was 22.4 26.8 % lower and FFM 13.7 7.5 % higher compared with DXA ( P < 0.01 ) .",3
"During treatment , the change in ECW was similar between BIS and bromide dilution , whereas BIS gave a significantly greater reduction in FM ( 19.4 44.8 % ) and a greater increase in FFM ( 5.6 3.0 % ) compared with DXA ( P < 0.01 ) .",3
"Significant differences in body composition estimates between the BIS and DXA were observed only in men , particularly during the treatment that caused greatest change in water compartments and body composition .",3
"In healthy adults , bioimpedance spectroscopy is an acceptable tool for measuring ECW ; however , BIS overestimates FFM and substantially underestimates FM compared with DXA .",4
"There was no statistically significant difference in the rate of efficacy failure for paliperidone palmitate compared with haloperidol decanoate ( adjusted hazard ratio , 0.98 ; 95 % CI , 0.65-1 .47 ) .",3
The number of participants who experienced efficacy failure was 49 ( 33.8 % ) in the paliperidone palmitate group and 47 ( 32.4 % ) in the haloperidol decanoate group .,3
"On average , participants in the paliperidone palmitate group gained weight and those in the haloperidol decanoate group lost weight ; after 6 months , the least-squares mean weight change for those taking paliperidone palmitate was increased by 2.17 kg ( 95 % CI , 1.25-3 .09 ) and was decreased for those taking haloperidol decanoate ( -0.96 kg ; 95 % CI , -1.88 to -0.04 ) .",3
"Patients taking paliperidone palmitate had significantly higher maximum mean levels of serum prolactin ( men , 34.56 g/L [ 95 % CI , 29.75-39 .37 ] vs 15.41 g/L [ 95 % CI , 10.73-20 .08 ] ; P < .001 , and for women , 75.19 [ 95 % CI , 63.03-87 .36 ] vs 26.84 [ 95 % CI , 13.29-40 .40 ] ; P < .001 ) .",3
"Patients taking haloperidol decanoate had significantly larger increases in global ratings of akathisia ( 0.73 [ 95 % CI , 0.59-0 .87 ] vs 0.45 [ 95 % CI , 0.31-0 .59 ] ; P = .006 ) .",3
"In adults with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder , use of paliperidone palmitate vs haloperidol decanoate did not result in a statistically significant difference in efficacy failure , but was associated with more weight gain and greater increases in serum prolactin , whereas haloperidol decanoate was associated with more akathisia .",4
"However , the CIs do not rule out the possibility of a clinically meaningful advantage with paliperidone palmitate .",4
Few differences in the outcomes were observed .,3
Plasma tissue factor remained elevated during filtered air exposure ( P = 0.002 ) .,3
P-selectin declined independent of exposure ( P = 0.0006 ) .,3
Interleukin-6 increased after filtered air ( P = 0.03 ) .,3
The study confirmed previous observations among nonatopics of limited changes after a 3-hour wood smoke exposure .,4
"The women in the intervention group had a mean weight loss of 9.4 % , whereas the weight in the control group remained almost the same ( P < 0.001 ) .",3
"While there were no change in stress and urge incontinence episodes in the control group , the mean number of stress incontinence episodes per 3-day diary dropped from 7.96 episodes to 3.11 , and the mean number of urge incontinence episodes per 3-day diary dropped from 2.85 episodes to 1.08 in the study group ( P < 0.05 ) .",3
"Regarding the POP-Q system , only genital hiatus , perineal body , and Ap measurements were significantly lower in the weight loss group than in the control group after 6months .",3
"Weight reduction provides improvement in episodes of UI , decreases the incidence of drops of urine leakage , and increases quality of life related to pelvic floor symptoms .",4
"However , there are little to no changes in the parameters of the POP-Q system with weight reduction .",4
"With ABT 50 mg , median TTH of primary vesicular lesion was reduced ( 7 days vs 7.3 days , P = .015 ) , the incidence of blocked herpes episodes was increased by 24.2 % ( 34.9 % vs 28.1 % ; P = .042 ) , and the median duration of herpes episodes was reduced ( 5.6 days vs 6.4 days , P = .003 ) .",3
"During the 9-month follow-up period , recurrence of herpes lesions was less frequent ( 64.2 % vs 73.6 % ; P = .027 ) and delayed ( 205 days vs 165 days , P = .041 ) in the ABT 50 mg .",3
Both treatments were safe .,3
A single application of ABT improves all endpoints of HL and might modify its clinical course in decreasing the incidence and delaying the onset of the next recurrence .,4
We recruited 806 patients stabilized after an ACS from 14 hospitals in 13 Indian cities .,3
"The mean age was 56.4 ( 11.32 ) years , and 17.2 % were females .",3
"A high prevalence of risk factors such as hypertension ( 43.4 % ) , diabetes ( 31.9 % ) , tobacco consumption ( 35.4 % ) , and inadequate physical activity ( 70.5 % ) was documented .",3
"A little over half had ST-elevation myocardial infarction ( 53.7 % ) , and 46.3 % had non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction or unstable angina .",3
The CHW interventions and training for SPREAD have been developed and adapted for local use .,4
The results and experience of this study will be important to counter the burden of cardiovascular diseases in low - to middle income countries .,4
"Despite the short treatment duration , both RO-151 and RO-838 showed trends for improved HbA1c and consistent reductions in body weight ( -0.86 to -1.67 kg ) exceeding those observed with placebo ( -0.28 kg , p = 0.019 for 200 mg RO-151 vs. placebo ) .",3
Insulin sensitivity parameters ( e.g. HOMA-IR and Matsuda-Index ) improved non-significantly with 200 mg RO-151 .,3
"Lipid parameters did not consistently improve with either compound , but RO-838 led to non-significant increases in triglycerides and VLDL-cholesterol versus placebo .",3
Both compounds were well tolerated and showed inhibitory effects on 11-HSD1 activity based on urinary corticosteroid excretion .,3
"As reported for other 11-HSD1-inhibitors increased concentrations of ACTH and adrenal androgen precursors were found with RO-151 , but not with RO-838 .",3
"Slight metabolic improvements were seen , in particular with RO-151 high dose , however , the observed changes often did not reach statistical significance and were not clearly dose dependent .",4
Studies of longer duration are needed to further investigate potential benefits and risks of these compounds .,4
There were no differences in distance walked or perceived fatigue between the 2 walking conditions .,3
"However , there was a reduced physiological cost of walking ( P < .05 ) , a smaller reduction in knee extensor strength ( P < .05 ) , and a smaller increase in standing postural sway with eyes open ( P < .01 ) after walking while wearing the DAO compared with walking without wearing the DAO .",3
"Despite not increasing walking distance or reducing perceived fatigue , the DAO reduced the physiological cost of walking and maintained knee strength and standing balance , which may have important implications for physical rehabilitation in people with MS. Further trials are required to determine whether the beneficial effects of wearing a DAO found here are maintained for longer periods .",4
"We excluded respondents whose meals totaled 0 calories or > 4000 calories , leaving 823 parents in the analysis .",3
The mean age of the child for whom the meal was `` ordered '' was 9.5 years .,3
"Parents whose menus displayed no label ordered an average of 1294 calories , whereas those shown calories only , calories plus minutes , or calories plus miles ordered 1066 , 1060 , and 1099 calories , respectively ( P = .0001 ) .",3
Only 20 % of parents reported that calories-only labeling would be `` very likely '' to prompt them to encourage their children to exercise versus 38 % for calories plus minutes ( P < .0001 ) and 37 % for calories plus miles ( P < .0001 ) .,3
PACE labeling may influence parents ' decisions on what fast food items to order for their children and encourage them to get their children to exercise .,4
"In the 80 % FiO2 group , the rate of temporary RLNP ( 4.4 % ) was significantly lower compared with the 30 % FiO2 group ( 9.4 % ) ( p = 0.040 ) .",3
"In addition , postoperative transient biochemical hypoparathyroidism occurred more frequently in the 30 % FiO2 group ( 48.5 % ) than in the 80 % FiO2 group ( 16.3 % ) ( p = 0.046 ) .",3
"Supplemental 80 % FiO2 significantly reduced postoperative levels of C-reactive protein ( p < 0.01 ) , IL6 and IL1 ( p < 0.05 ) , fatigue ( p < 0.01 ) , and overall pain during the first 24 postoperative hours ( p < 0.01 ) .",3
Supplemental 80 % FiO2 also reduced nausea and vomiting on the day of operation ( p = 0.058 ) .,3
"Supplemental 80 % FiO2 reduced postoperative temporary RLNP and hypoparathyroidism rates and reduced pain , fatigue , nausea , and vomiting after thyroid surgery .",4
"In case of positive evaluation , the proposed study will provide evidence for a sustainable reduction of polypharmacy by enhancing patient-centeredness and patient autonomy .",4
"Seventy-one patients were enrolled , with breast ( n = 22 ) and lung cancers ( n = 14 ) being the most common primary cancers .",3
"The most frequent drug-related adverse events were grade 1 to 3 diarrhea and rash , grade 1 to 2 fatigue .",3
"During dose escalation , the key DLT was grade 3 diarrhea observed in 5 patients at 1000 mg BID ( n = 1 ) , 1500 mg BID ( n = 1 ) , 800 mg TID ( n = 1 ) and 1200 mg TID ( n = 2 ) .",3
AST1306 was rapidly absorbed and had moderate to high clearance .,3
"PK concentration parameters increased with dose over the range evaluated , with no evidence of accumulation over time .",3
"Under fed conditions , the mean T ( max ) was prolonged , C ( max ) was increased , and AUC ( 0 - ) was raised .",3
"Of the 55 evaluable patients , 7 patients experienced partial responses , including 5 with breast cancer , 1 with lung cancer , and 1 with gastric cancer .",3
The best response with stable disease for6 months was achieved in 7 patients .,3
"Based on the DLT and PK profile , the RP2D was defined as 1000 mg TID with evidence of preliminary anti-tumor activity .",4
Further studies are recommended .,4
"There were significant improvements with flibanserin versus placebo in the mean ( SE ) changes in the number of SSEs ( 1.0 [ 0.1 ] vs 0.6 [ 0.1 ] ) , FSFI desire domain score ( 0.7 [ 0.1 ] vs 0.4 [ 0.1 ] ) , FSDS-R Item 13 score ( -0.8 [ 0.1 ] vs -0.6 [ 0.1 ] ) , FSDS-R total score ( -8.3 [ 0.6 ] vs -6.3 [ 0.6 ] ) , and FSFI total score ( 4.2 [ 0.4 ] vs 2.7 [ 0.4 ] ; all P < 0.01 ) .",3
More women on flibanserin ( 37.6 % ) than women on placebo ( 28.0 % ) reported experiencing meaningful benefits from the study medication on treatment discontinuation .,3
"The most frequent adverse events associated with flibanserin were dizziness , somnolence , nausea , and headache .",3
"In naturally postmenopausal women with HSDD , flibanserin , compared with placebo , has been associated with improvement in sexual desire , improvement in the number of SSEs , and reduced distress associated with low sexual desire , and is well tolerated .",4
"A total of 60 participants were administered the study drugs , and 52 participants ( 27 participants in part A ; 25 participants in part B ) were analyzed as part of the PK dataset .",3
"In part A , the GMRs ( gemigliptin + rosuvastatin/gemigliptin ) of the Cmax and AUC values of gemigliptin were 0.955 ( 90 % CI = 0.874-1 .044 ) and 1.023 ( 90 % CI = 0.991-1 .057 ) , and those of rosuvastatin were 1.012 ( 90 % CI = 0.946-1 .084 ) and 1.086 ( 90 % CI = 1.032-1 .142 ) , respectively .",3
"In part B , the GMRs of the Cmax and AUC values of gemigliptin were 1.046 ( 90 % CI = 0.964-1 .134 ) and 1.035 ( 90 % CI = 1.005-1 .065 ) , and those of irbesartan were 0.966 ( 90 % CI = 0.897-1 .040 ) and 1.050 ( 90 % CI = 0.993-1 .111 ) , respectively .",3
"The limitations of this study include its relatively short treatment period and small sample size , as only healthy participants were included .",3
"Gemigliptin does not affect the PK properties of rosuvastatin or irbesartan ; also , rosuvastatin and irbesartan do not affect the PKs of gemigliptin .",4
"Compared with the CEA group , PaO2 in PVB group increased and PaCO2 declined significantly .",3
"There was no difference of VAS score under quiet state , but under the motion state the VAS scores declined significantly , the total amount of morphine reduced [ ( 5.2 1.2 ) vs ( 13.9 1.6 ) mg ) ] , the cases of nausea , vomiting , pruritus , orthostatic hypotension decreased and the postoperative first anal exhaust time interval shortened ( P < 0.05 ) .",3
"Compared with CEA , postoperative administration of PVB for open nephrectomy results in lowering morphine dose as well as side effect related with the use of morphine .",4
"HR coronary CT angiography showed a higher image quality score ( 3.7 vs 3.4 , P < .001 ) and evaluability ( 97 % vs 92 % , P < .002 ) .",3
"In a segment-based analysis , HR coronary CT angiography showed a higher specificity , positive predictive value , and accuracy in comparison with SR coronary CT angiography ( 98 % , 91 % , and 99 % vs 95 % , 80 % , and 95 % , respectively ; P < .001 ) .",3
"Moreover , HR coronary CT angiography showed a better agreement with ICA for calcified plaques compared with SR coronary CT angiography and ICA ( 83 % vs 53 % , P < .001 ) .",3
"In a patient-based analysis , HR coronary CT angiography showed higher specificity and accuracy compared with SR coronary CT angiography ( 91 % and 98 % vs 46 % and 92 % , respectively ; P < .01 ) .",3
No differences in radiation exposure were found between the two groups .,3
"Improved evaluability and accuracy were seen with HR compared with SR coronary CT angiography of calcified coronary artery lesions , suggesting a potential use for this technology in patients at high risk for CAD .",4
"Normalised positive intensity values , ( median ( interquartile range ( IQR ) ) , for CD56 were lower in GA121 ( 116-134 ) versus 136 ( 132-142 ) , p = 0.015 .",3
"CD4 was also lower in GA10 .9 ( 5.5-27 .8 ) versus PPA 19.7 ( 14.4-83 .5 ) , p = 0.03 but CD8 5.5 ( 4.0-9 .75 ) versus 13.0 ( 5.0-14 .5 ) respectively , p = 0.24 and CD 68 infiltration 5.8 ( 3.25-8 .75 ) versus 8.0 ( 3.0-8 .75 ) , p = 0.74 were not significantly different .",3
PPA induces increased levels of NK and T helper cell infiltration into breast cancer tissue compared with GA but not T suppressor cells or macro phages .,4
This is consistent with the hypothesis that the anaesthetic technique may affect perioperative immune function conducive to resisting breast cancer recurrence and metastasis .,4
"A gene x intervention x time effect was detected for individual polymorphisms , in particular the PACAP receptor , ADCYAP1R1 , as well as with a combined genotype risk score created from independent SNP markers .",3
Subjects who did not receive treatment had higher symptoms than those who received intervention .,3
"Furthermore , subjects with the `` risk '' genotypes who did not receive intervention had higher PTSD symptoms compared to those with the `` low-risk '' or `` resilience '' genotypes or those who received intervention .",3
"Additionally , PTSD symptoms correlated with level of genetic risk at week 12 ( P < .005 ) in the assessment-only group , but with no relationship in the intervention group , even after controlling for age , sex , race , education , income , and childhood trauma .",3
"Using logistic regression , the number of risk alleles was significantly associated with likelihood of PTSD diagnosis at week 12 ( P < .05 ) .",3
This pilot prospective study suggests that combined genetic variants may serve to predict those most at risk for developing PTSD following trauma .,4
A psychotherapeutic intervention initiated in the emergency department within hours of the trauma may mitigate this risk .,4
"The role of genetic predictors of risk and resilience should be further evaluated in larger , prospective intervention and prevention trials .",4
Data were collected for a total of 71 patients and 238 activities .,3
Important ( although not significant ) descriptive statistics regarding early mobility in the intensive care unit were discovered .,3
The unintended result of the research study was a change in the culture and practice regarding early mobility in the intensive care unit .,3
Early mobility can be implemented in intensive care units .,4
"Standard equipment can be used to mobilize such patients safely ; however , for patients who ambulate , a platform may increase efficiency and effectiveness .",4
"There was a significant postoperative improvement in total PISQ-12 scores for the entire cohort ( 33.2 vs 38.3 , P < 0.01 ) .",3
"Similarly , PISQ-12 scores were significantly improved in both groups ( 33.2 preoperative vs 37.4 one year postoperative in the porcine dermis , P < 0.01 and 33.2 vs 39.2 in the polypropylene mesh , P < 0.01 ) .",3
There were no differences between the 2 graft material groups .,3
"Preoperatively , 63.0 % ( 48/76 ) of women reported avoiding sexual intercourse because of bulging in vagina ( PISQ12-question # 8 ) , at 1 year postoperatively only 4 % ( 3/76 ) had a positive response ( P < 0.01 ) .",3
"We observed a significant decrease in the number of women who reported pain during intercourse at 12 months as evidenced by the responses to the PISQ12-question # 5 , 47.4 % ( 36/76 ) versus 26.3 % ( 20/76 ) ( P < 0.01 ) .",3
The addition of a suburethral sling or a perineorrhaphy did not negatively impact sexual function at 1 year .,3
Laparoscopic sacrocolpopexy had a positive impact on sexual function at 1 year regardless of whether a porcine dermis or a polypropylene mesh material was used .,4
Concentrations of endotoxin in rumen fluid and feces of cows fed HCS were significantly higher than those of cows fed LCS and LCF .,3
"Feeding HCS increased the release of IL-1 , IL-6 and IL-8 in the mammary gland compared with feeding LCS .",3
Concentrations of cytokines ( IL-1 and IL-8 ) in mammary venous plasma had a negative correlation with milk production efficiencies .,3
Results indicated that the high-concentrate corn straw diet increased the concentrations of endotoxin in rumen fluid and feces .,4
"Furthermore , feeding the high-concentrate corn straw diet stimulated the mammary gland to release more pro-inflammatory cytokines .",4
The results suggest that feeding a high-concentrate corn straw diet induce a higher pro-inflammatory response in the mammary gland and thus may partly decrease the milk production efficiencies in dairy cows .,4
"This was a prospective , open-label , randomized , parallel-group , multicenter study assessing the role of continuous warfarin therapy in preventing periprocedural thromboembolic and hemorrhagic events after radiofrequency catheter ablation .",3
Patients with CHADS2 score 1 were included .,3
Patients were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to the off-warfarin or on-warfarin arm .,3
The incidence of thromboembolic events in the 48 hours after ablation was the primary end point of the study .,3
The study enrolled 1584 patients : 790 assigned to discontinue warfarin ( group 1 ) and 794 assigned to continuous warfarin ( group 2 ) .,3
No statistical difference in baseline characteristics was observed .,3
"There were 39 thromboembolic events ( 3.7 % strokes [ n = 29 ] and 1.3 % transient ischemic attacks [ n = 10 ] ) in group 1 : two events ( 0.87 % ) in patients with paroxysmal AF , 4 ( 2.3 % ) in patients with persistent AF , and 33 ( 8.5 % ) in patients with long-standing persistent AF .",3

"In this phase III study , eribulin was not shown to be superior to capecitabine with regard to OS or PFS .",4
Lp ( a ) concentrations were similar at age 11 years in the intervention and control groups .,3
"In all control children , FMD ( % ) associated inversely with Lp ( a ) concentration : ( [ % / 1000 mg/L ] = -3.74 , 95 % CI [ -6.43 , -1.45 ] ; P = .007 ) and in 68 familial risk children ( = -4.92 , 95 % CI [ -8.18 , -1.66 ] ; P = .0037 ) .",3
"In the intervention group the associations were lacking ( P > .5 ) , and FMD in the children with high Lp ( a ) concentrations ( > 500 mg/L , n = 12 ) had no attenuation ( P = .027 ) .",3
Familial high Lp ( a ) concentration is associated with attenuated endothelial function .,4
This association may be mitigated by an early lifestyle intervention .,4

A statistically significant improvement was noted in all parameters except for the size of ulcers in patients treated with levamisole alone and with combination of levamisole and low-dose prednisolone .,3
There was no statistically significant improvement in the placebo group .,3
"Both active groups had significantly better improvement when compared to placebo group , while there was no significant difference between the two active groups .",3
Levamisole alone and combination of levamisole and low-dose prednisolone are effective modes of therapy for RAS .,4
"Craving and anxiety levels decreased significantly following one session of acupuncture ( -1.04 , p = .0001 ; -8.83 , p < .0001 ) or RR intervention ( -.43 , p = .02 ; -4.64 , p = .03 ) .",3
"The level of craving continued to drop with additional intervention sessions ( regression coefficient b = -.10 , p = .01 , and b = -.10 , p = .02 for acupuncture and RR groups , respectively ) .",3
"Number of daily practice days of RR-eliciting techniques is also associated with reduction in craving ratings ( b = -.02 , p = .008 ) .",3
"Findings demonstrate the value of attending regular acupuncture and RR-eliciting intervention sessions , as well as the daily practice of RR-eliciting techniques .",4
Substance addiction is a complex disease and effective treatment remains a challenge .,4
Our study findings add to the scientific evidence of these two non-pharmaceutical approaches for SUD .,4
"We randomly assigned 10,275 children to receive either vaccine ( n = 6851 ) or placebo ( n = 3424 ) , of whom 6710 ( 98 % ) and 3350 ( 98 % ) , respectively , were included in the primary analysis .",3
250 cases of virologically confirmed dengue took place more than 28 days after the third injection ( 117 [ 47 % ] in the vaccine group and 133 [ 53 % ] in the control group ) .,3
The primary endpoint was achieved with 565 % ( 95 % CI 438-664 ) efficacy .,3
We recorded 647 serious adverse events ( 402 [ 62 % ] in the vaccine group and 245 [ 38 % ] in the control group ) .,3
54 ( 1 % ) children in the vaccine group and 33 ( 1 % ) of those in the control group had serious adverse events that happened within 28 days of vaccination .,3
Serious adverse events were consistent with medical disorders in this age group and were mainly infections and injuries .,3
"Our findings show that dengue vaccine is efficacious when given as three injections at months 0 , 6 , and 12 to children aged 2-14 years in endemic areas in Asia , and has a good safety profile .",4
Vaccination could reduce the incidence of symptomatic infection and hospital admission and has the potential to provide an important public health benefit .,4
"Twenty-five percent of the respondents opted for hospital treatment regardless of the description of the early assisted discharge program , and 46 % never opted for the hospital .",3
"The best model contained four latent classes of respondents , defined by different preferences for the hospital and caregiver burden .",3
Preferences for other attributes were constant across classes .,3
Attributes with the strongest effect on choices were the burden on informal caregivers and co-payments .,3
"Except for the number of visits , all attributes had a significant effect on choices in the expected direction .",3
Considerable segments of respondents had fixed preferences for either treatment option .,4
Applying latent class analysis was essential in quantifying preferences for attributes of early assisted discharge .,4
"Overall , 404 subjects were recruited .",3
"At recruitment , seropositivity was already high for poliovirus ( PV ) serotype 1 ( zinc : 91.1 % ; control : 90.5 % ) and PV2 ( 90.0 % ; 92.7 % ) , with lower estimates for PV3 ( 70.0 % ; 64.8 % ) .",3
"By week 18 , the proportion of subjects with measured zinc levels in the normal range ( i.e. 60 g/dL ) was significantly greater in the intervention group compared to the control group ( 71.9 % ; 27.4 % ; p < 0.001 ) .",3
"No significant difference in seroconversion was demonstrated between the groups for PV1 , PV2 , or PV3 .",3
There was no effect of zinc supplementation on OPV immunogenicity .,4
These conclusions were confirmed when restricting the analysis to those with measured higher zinc levels .,4
"There was no significant difference in effective rate between the treatment group and control group ( X ( 2 ) = 0.295,0.413 , P > 0.01 ) at 4-week and 12-week after treatment .",3
There was significant difference in REU scores between the 2 groups ( P < 0.01 ) 4 weeks after treatment .,3
Tacrolimus mouth rinse effects quickly and is worthy of application in the treatment of erosive and ulcerative OLP .,4
"After iTBSiM1 , improvements in paretic grip-lift performance were accompanied by an immediate facilitation of ipsilesional M1 excitability and a subsequent increase in ipsilesional short latency afferent inhibition ( SAI ) during training .",3
"Precision grip-lift performance improved after cTBScM1 and training , alongside increased ipsilesional M1 excitability with no effect on ipsilesional SAI .",3
There were no effects on sensory performance .,3
Primary motor cortex iTBS not only modulates M1 corticospinal excitability but also increases M1 receptiveness to sensory input .,4
Priming with iTBSiM1 may enhance ipsilesional sensorimotor integration and facilitate better quality sensorimotor training after subcortical stroke .,4
"The seizure frequency and VAS of breakthrough pain in group A decreased significantly after the treatment ( P < 0.05 ) and the general satisfaction was the best among the the 3 groups ( P < 0.05 ) , with less nausea and vomiting , constipation , drowsiness and fewer other side effects .",3
Pregabalin combined with intrathecal sufentanil infusion can effectively relieve breakthrough pain in patients with bone metastases .,4
VERIFY is the first study to investigate the long-term clinical benefits of early combination treatment vs. the standard-of-care metformin monotherapy with a second agent added by threshold criteria .,4
There were no differences between groups at baseline .,3
"A significant group-by-time interaction ( F [ 2,8 ] = 17.59 ; p < 0.0001 ) was noted for the MDS-UPDRS III , with the AT group having lower scores at 12 and 24 months than the controls .",3
"Significant interactions were also noted for the Mini-BESTest , MDS-UPDRS II and I , and 6MWT .",3
This is believed to be one of the longest-duration studies to examine the effects of exercise on PD .,4
"Participation in community-based dance classes over 2 years was associated with improvements in motor and nonmotor symptom severity , performance on activities of daily living , and balance in a small group of people with PD .",4
This is noteworthy given the progressive nature of PD and the fact that the control group declined on some outcome measures over 2 years .,4
"Between Jan 13 , and Dec 27 , 2013 , 3606 patients were admitted to the eight units ( n = 1983 control period ; n = 1623 intervention period ) .",3
"There were fewer falls ( n = 196 , 780/1000 patient-days vs n = 380 , 1378/1000 patient-days , adjusted rate ratio 060 [ robust 95 % CI 042-094 ] , p = 0003 ) , injurious falls ( n = 66 , 263/1000 patient-days vs 131 , 475/1000 patient-days , 065 [ robust 95 % CI 042-088 ] , p = 0006 ) , and fallers ( n = 136 [ 838 % ] vs n = 248 [ 1251 % ] adjusted odds ratio 055 [ robust 95 % CI 038 to 081 ] , p = 0003 ) in the intervention compared with the control group .",3
"There was no significant difference in length of stay ( intervention median 11 days [ IQR 7-19 ] , control 10 days [ 6-18 ] ) .",3
Individualised patient education programmes combined with training and feedback to staff added to usual care reduces the rates of falls and injurious falls in older patients in rehabilitation hospital-units .,4
"The study revealed that , ease of insertion of LMA , was statistically significantly greater in group 1 when compared with group 2 ( P 0.05 ) .",3
The time required for successful insertion of LMA was lesser in group 1 patients ( 53.8 7.77 s ) than in group 2 patients ( 84.7 16.54 s ) ( P 0.001 ) .,3
"Severity of undesired responses were more in group 2 , as incremental boluses of respective induction agents were required in 20 % patients in thiopentone group compared to only 6 % patients in propofol group and 13 % of patients in thiopentone group required rescue succinylcholine .",4
There are challenges in the design of this trial .,4
"Assessing change through population surveys may reduce measurable effects ; however , we feel this is appropriate because we aim to attract those who currently do not use clinics , and we hope to improve care for clinic users .",4
Clinics were randomised at an open meeting because we were concerned that a remote process of randomisation would not be trusted by the community .,4
We are constantly working to achieve an effective balance between the intervention and process evaluations .,4
"In total , 369 mothers and their children completed the follow-up study , a phase 2 completion rate of 79.4 % ( 80.9 % for the intervention group and 77.7 % for the control group ) .",3
The differences between the intervention and control groups at age 2 years in children 's BMI and BMI z score disappeared over time .,3
"At age 2 years , the difference ( intervention minus control ) in BMI ( calculated as weight in kilograms divided by height in meters squared ) was -0.41 ( 95 % CI , -0.71 to -0.10 ; P = .009 ) , but by age 5 years it was 0.03 ( 95 % CI , -0.30 to 0.37 ) .",3
"No effects of the early intervention on dietary behaviors , quality of life , physical activity , and TV viewing time were detected at age 5 years .",3
The significant effect of this early life home-visiting intervention on child BMI and BMI z score at age 2 years was not sustained at age 5 years without further intervention .,4
Obesity prevention programs need to be continued or maintained during the early childhood years .,4
Intraduodenal L-Trp suppressed antral pressures ( P < .05 ) and stimulated pyloric pressures ( P < .01 ) and markedly increased cholecystokinin and glucagon ( both P < .001 ) .,3
"Glucagon-like peptide-1 and peptide tyrosine tyrosine increased modestly ( both P < .001 ) , but there was no effect on total ghrelin .",3
Insulin increased slightly ( P < .05 ) without affecting blood glucose .,3
Plasma L-Trp increased substantially ( P < .001 ) .,3
All effects were dose-related and associated with increased fullness and substantially decreased energy intake ( P < .001 ) .,3
There was a strong inverse correlation between energy intake and plasma L-Trp ( r = -0.70 ; P < .001 ) .,3
Low caloric intraduodenal loads of L-Trp affect gut motor and hormonal function and markedly reduce energy intake .,4
"A strong inverse correlation between energy intake and plasma L-Trp suggests that , beyond gut mechanisms , direct effects of circulating L-Trp mediate its eating-inhibitory effect .",4
EstCSFP ( 10.53.6 mmHg versus 9.03.7 mmHg ; P = 0.003 ) and estTLCPD ( 12.04.4 mmHg versus 5.43.8 mmHg ; P < 0.001 ) were higher in the ocular hypertensive group than in the normotensive group .,3
"In binary regression analysis , ocular hypertension was associated with increased estCSFP ( P = 0.03 ; odds ratio ( OR ) : 1.08 ; 95 % confidence interval ( CI ) : 1.01 , 1.17 ) after adjusting for prevalence of arterial hypertension ( P = 0.07 ; OR : 1.79 ; 95 % CI : 0.96 , 3.34 ) , retinal nerve fiber layer thickness ( P = 0.03 ; OR : 0.97 ; 95 % CI : 0.95 , 0.997 ) and blood glucose concentration ( P = 0.006 ; OR : 1.17 ; 95 % CI : 1.04 , 1.30 ) .",3
Ocular hypertensive subjects ( with IOP correction for CCT and corneal curvature ) as compared to ocular normotensive subjects had a significantly higher estCSFP in univariate analysis and in multivariate analysis .,4
"Despite of a higher estCSFP , estTLCPD was still markedly higher in ocular hypertensive eyes than in ocular normotensive eyes .",4
Adjusted response rate was 54.4 % .,3
Response was higher among younger men ( P < 0.001 ) and those with earlier stage disease ( P = 0.002 ) .,3
"A modest 2.6 % higher response rate was observed in the lottery compared with the prize arm [ multivariate relative risk ( RR ) = 1.06 ; 95 % confidence interval ( CI ) : 1.00 , 1.11 ] .",3
"When stratified by survival period , higher response in the lottery arm was only observed among long-term survivors ( multivariate RR = 1.10 ; 95 % CI : 1.02 , 1.19 ; short-term survivors : RR = 1.01 ; 95 % CI : 0.94 , 1.09 ) .",3
"Costs per completed questionnaire were 4.54 and 3.57 for the lottery and prize arms , respectively .",3
"Compared with the prize arm , cost per additional questionnaire returned in the lottery arm was 25.65 .",3
"Although more expensive , to optimize response to postal questionnaires among cancer survivors , researchers might consider inclusion of a lottery scratch card .",4
Use of the two manual brushes resulted in statistically significant reductions in surface stain relative to baseline after two weeks of use .,3
"Median stain reductions were 78 % and 60 % for the OBP and CW , respectively , as measured by the Modified Lobene Stain Index .",3
"The mean changes in the composite scores from baseline to week two were 1.85 and 1.57 for the two treatment groups , respectively .",3
Statistically significant reductions from baseline were also found for the intensity and extent of stain measures ( p < 0.001 ) .,3
Similar trends were found using the new Interproximal Modified Lobene Index .,3
"Composite median stain removal percentages versus baseline were 88 % and 73 % for the OBP and CW groups , respectively ( p < 0.001 ) .",3
"For the interproximal sites , a median stain removal of 92 % was observed with the OBP brush and 83 % reduction with the CW brush .",3
"For the gingival sites , the median stain removal percentages were 83 % and 50 % , respectively For the body region , a median stain removal of 100 % was found for both treatment groups .",3
No statistically significant differences were found between the two groups for the mean composite scores for either index .,3
"Both manual brushes showed effective stain removal , including interproximal hard-to-reach sites .",4
"The Interproximal Modified Lobene Stain Index gave clinically relevant results consistent with the traditional Modified Lobene Stain Index , while allowing assessment of interproximal regions .",4
"After the evaluation between groups , VAS scores were significantly lower in Group II and III than Group I and in Group III than in Group II ( p < 0.05 ) .",3
"When post micturation VAS scores were evaluated , VAS scores were significantly lower in Group II than Group I and in Group III than in Group II ( p < 0.05 ) .",3
"The application of local anesthetic lidocaine gel in rigid cystoscopy , is a practical , safe and efficient method to improve patient comfort when applied in appropriate dose and waiting duration .",4
"Pegfilgrastim mean AUC0-inf values for the on-body injector ( n = 125 ) and manual injection ( n = 128 ) were 10,900 and 11,100 hng/mL , respectively ; mean C max values were 248 and 262ng/mL , respectively .",3
"The least squares geometric mean ratios were 0.97 for C max and 1.00 for AUC0-inf ; the corresponding 90 % CIs were within the prespecified range ( 0.80-1 .25 ) , indicating comparable pegfilgrastim pharmacokinetics between delivery methods .",3
"Treatment-emergent adverse events ( AEs ) were similar between groups ( injector , 86 % ; manual , 85 % ) .",3
"Injector - or syringe-related AEs were more prevalent with the injector ( 13 % ; manual , 4 % ) ; none were serious .",3
No pegfilgrastim-neutralizing antibodies were detected .,3
Pegfilgrastim pharmacokinetics and safety were comparable between the on-body injector and manual injection groups .,4
"At baseline , the young , healthy participants had a mean plasma 25 ( OH ) D concentration of 17.56.1 ng/ml .",3
Only two subjects exhibited plasma 25 ( OH ) D concentrations > 30ng/ml .,3
"At 5 days , subjects randomized to vitamin D3 had a higher mean plasma 25 ( OH ) D concentration compared with the placebo group ( 39.1 vs 19.1 ng/ml , P < 0.001 ) .",3
Plasma 25 ( OH ) D concentrations returned to baseline at 90 and 365 days in the vitamin D3 group and remained unchanged in the placebo group .,3
PTH and calcium concentrations were unrelated to changes in 25 ( OH ) D levels and similar between groups over time .,3
"A dose of 250,000 IU of vitamin D3 given once in November resulted in a robust increase in plasma 25 ( OH ) D after 5 days , but it was unable to sustain this increase after 90 days .",4
A larger or more frequent dosing regimen may be needed for long-term vitamin D sufficiency .,4
"During 56 months of follow-up , 4,699 cases of cognitive decline occurred .",3
"We observed lower risk of cognitive decline among those in the healthiest dietary quintile of modified Alternative Healthy Eating Index compared with lowest quintile ( hazard ratio 0.76 , 95 % confidence interval 0.66-0 .86 , Q5 vs Q1 ) .",3
Lower risk of cognitive decline was consistent regardless of baseline cognitive level .,3
We found that higher diet quality was associated with a reduced risk of cognitive decline .,4
Improved diet quality represents an important potential target for reducing the global burden of cognitive decline .,4
"The increase in perioperative morphine administration ( groups B and C ) led to a significantly prolonged return to normal bowel function and delayed ambulation ( P < 0.05 to 0.01 , respectively ) , without an improvement in postoperative analgesia or a reduction in local anesthetic consumption .",3
"Although the prevalence of obstructive sleep apnea ( OSA ) was high in all groups , no respiratory depression was observed .",3
"Thoracic PCEA with 0.1 % levobupivacaine combined with continuous epidural morphine administration of 0.2 mg/h without morphine loading is an effective postoperative analgesic regimen that provides adequate pain control , early ambulation , and early return of bowel function in superobese patients , particularly those with OSA .",4
"Caloric intake did not differ on alprazolam versus placebo ( t ( 15 ) = 1.72 , p = .11 ) .",3
"Alprazolam did not reduce anxiety , but was associated with increased fatigue .",3
"This study was not able to evaluate the causal role of anxiety in meal intake among individuals with AN , as alprazolam did not alter anxiety symptoms .",4
These data further suggest that the therapeutic role for short-acting benzodiazepines in AN is likely limited .,4
Time to T4 among the three groups was not significantly different ( P = 0.14 ) .,3
"However , there was a significant difference in achievement of block height of T4 at 12 min and greater need for epidural supplementation in the intervention groups compared to the control group ( P = 0.021 ) .",3
Non-inferiority analyses of time to T4 of both head elevated ramped positions were inconclusive about inferiority relative to the control .,3
Head Elevated Ramped Position was significantly more comfortable than control ( P = 0.007 ) .,3
"Using the level of the external auditory meatus to the sternal notch as an indicator for ease of laryngoscopy , Head Elevated Ramped Position provided a significantly better position than control ( P < 0.001 ) .",3
"Elevating the parturient undergoing elective caesarean delivery into the Head Elevated Ramped Position immediately or once the block had been established did not appear to significantly alter time to an adequate block height of T4 ; however , the need for epidural supplementation was greater in the intervention groups .",4
Cautious use of this novel position change can provide a more comfortable experience and provide a better airway position should conversion to general anaesthesia be required .,4
There was no difference in the binocular naked vision between the experimental group and the control group before the intervention .,3
"In contrast , there was significant improvement in binocular naked vision in the experimental group after the intervention compared with the control group ( P < 0.05 ) .",3
"When combined with external medical application , non-invasive auricular therapy could improve the function of myopia in children .",4
Auricular pressing was well received by the children .,4
"BASDAI in group 1 was 5.32 3.2 initially and 5.17 2.16 one year after onset of the study , ASDAS 3.45 2.1 and 3.1 1.1 respectively ( p > 0.05 ) .",3
"In group 2 , BASDAI values were 5.21 3.0 and 4.77 2.2 ; ASDAS 3.42 2.9 and 2.79 2.6 respectively .",3
"In group 3 , BASDAI values were 5.32 3.2 and 3.17 2.12 ; ASDAS 3.44 3.1 and 2.6 1.8 ; p < 0.05 for the differences between initial and subsequent values in groups 2 and 3 and final values for all groups .",3
"Positive PASS was reached in 15 patients ( 57.69 % , n = 26 ) of group 3 , in 4 ones ( 20 % , n = 20 ) of group 2 , and in 0 ( 0 % ) patients of group 1 .",3
"Five ( 19.23 % ) , 15 ( 75 % ) and 93 ( 96.87 % ) patients in groups 1 , 2 and 3 respectively wilfully ceased to take NSAID .",3
"96 ( 100 % ) , 19 ( 95 % ) and 3 ( 11.5 % ) patients of these groups stated that they needed hospitalization .",3
Telephone monitoring of ax-SpA activity once in every 4 weeks revealed a better compliance with the treatment and results of therapy than active observation every 12 weeks or arbitrary monitoring .,4
"In baseline models , African Americans had larger persistent level of limitations over time .",3
"Although employer-provided , spousal provided , and market insurances were directly associated with lower persistent levels of limitation , only differences in market insurance accounted for the racial disparities in persistent level of limitations .",3
"Results suggest private insurance is important for reducing functional limitations , but market insurance is an important mediator of the persistently larger level of limitations observed among African Americans .",4
"Of 301 eligible children , 76 ( 21 % ) families declined participation and 39 ( 13 % ) did not have access to a mobile phone .",3
186 Indigenous children were randomised and received dose one under supervision in hospital .,3
"Subsequently , 182 ( 99 % ) children received dose two ( day-7 ) , 169 ( 93 % ) dose three ( day-14 ) and 180 ( 97 % ) attended their clinical review ( day-21 ) .",3
A median of 2 calls ( IQR 1-3 ) were needed to verify adherence .,3
"Importantly , over 97 % of children remained in the RCT until their clinical endpoint at day-21 .",3
"In our setting , the use of mobile phones within an Indigenous-appropriate framework has been an effective strategy to support a clinical trial involving Australian Indigenous children in urban and remote Australia .",4
"Further research is required to explore other applications of this approach , including the impact on clinical outcomes .",4
CD5 + B cell numbers were comparable between the treatment groups at baseline .,3
"After an initial decline , absolute CD5 + B cell numbers progressively increased in patients in the RTX treatment arm , but remained low in CYC/AZA-treated patients .",3
"In both groups , the percentage of CD5 + B cells increased during remission induction and slowly declined thereafter .",3
"During relapse , the percentage of CD5 + B cells correlated inversely with disease activity in RTX-treated patients , but not in patients who received CYC/AZA .",3
No significant association was observed between the numbers of CD5 + B cells and induction treatment failure or disease severity .,3
The dynamics of the CD5 + B cell compartment did not anticipate disease relapse .,3
"Following B cell repopulation , the percentage of CD5 + B cells was not predictive of time to flare in RTX-treated patients .",3
The percentage of peripheral CD5 + B cells might reflect disease activity in RTX-treated patients .,4
"However , sole staining for CD5 as a putative surrogate marker for Breg cells did not identify a subpopulation of B cells with clear potential for meaningful clinical use .",4
Adequate phenotyping of Breg cells is required to further explore the value of these cells as biomarkers in AAV .,4
"Hazelnut allergy was confirmed by DBPCFC in 95/120 ( 79 % ) adults , 77 % had only subjective and 23 % objective symptoms , whereas in children , 63 % had objective symptoms to hazelnut .",3
"Within the group of children , the frequency of severe hazelnut allergy was higher in younger than in older children .",3
A concomitant birch pollen allergy was more common in adults ( 82 % ) than in children ( 39 % ) with a hazelnut allergy .,3
"A detailed history with allergic symptoms to previous ingestion of hazelnut had the highest diagnostic value in adults , while in children , SPT to hazelnut extract showed the highest level of discrimination between clinical reactivity and tolerance to hazelnut .",3
"Hazelnut allergy differs between children and adults with respect to frequency of severity , aetiology and relevance of diagnostic parameters .",4
"Therefore , age has to be taken into account in the diagnostic work-up of a hazelnut allergy .",4
Scores on the Every Day Problems Test for Cognitively Challenged Elders ( EPCCE ) and on the Direct Assessment of Functional Status ( DAFS ) showed significant increases only for the REAL group .,3
"For EPCCE , change from baseline immediately postintervention was +3.10 ( P < 0.01 ) , and there was significant retention at the 3-month follow-up ( d = 2.71 ; P < 0.01 ) .",3
"For DAFS , change from baseline immediately postintervention was +3.52 ( P < 0.001 ) , although retention was not as strong .",3
Neither the attention nor the no-treatment control groups had significant gains immediately postintervention or at follow-up assessments .,3
Post hoc across-group comparison of baseline change also highlights the benefits of REAL training .,3
"For EPCCE , the magnitude of gain was significantly larger in the REAL group versus the no-treatment control group immediately postintervention ( d = 3.82 ; P < 0.01 ) and at the 3-month follow-up ( d = 3.80 ; P < 0.01 ) .",3
"For DAFS , gain magnitude immediately postintervention for REAL was significantly greater compared with in the attention control group ( d = 4.73 ; P < 0.01 ) .",3
"REAL improves skills in everyday problem solving , which may allow AL residents to maintain self-care and extend AL residency .",4
This benefit is particularly important given the growing population of AL residents at risk for cognitive and self-care decline .,4
Seventy-nine patients aged 53.311.3 years were included .,3
"One year after surgery , median VAS pain intensity was still significantly improved ( neck , from 5 to 1 ; right arm , from 2 to 1 ; left arm , from 4 to 1 ) as was NDI ( from 40 to 20 ) .",3
"Neuroforaminal size showed a reduction on both sides ( left , 0.02890.09 cm ( 2 ) ; right , 0.01490.08 cm ( 2 ) ) .",3
"One year after the operation , segmental height decreased and facet degeneration increased from measures taken before the operation .",3
No correlations were found between neuroforaminal stenosis or the degree of facet degeneration and various clinical outcome parameters .,3
The decrease in segmental height one year after ACDF leads in turn to secondary neuroforaminal stenosis and progressive facet degeneration .,4
"Of the various neuroforaminal variables used , none revealed a threshold value indicative of the presence or severity of radicular arm pain .",4
This absence of correlation between imaging and clinical information is important and should be considered when allocating patients for surgical interventions .,4
"Irrespective of age , patients who participated in the trial had fewer comorbid diseases , a higher socioeconomic status , and smaller tumors ( all P < .001 ) .",3
"In patients aged 65 to 74 years , those who participated in the trial had a similar overall mortality to patients from the general population ( multivariable hazard ratio [ HR ] = 1.08 ; 95 % confidence interval [ CI ] = 0.73 to 1.60 ) .",3
"Alternatively , in patients aged 75 years or older , those who participated in the trial had a lower overall mortality ( multivariable HR = 0.72 ; 95 % CI = 0.55 to 0.95 ; P = .02 ) than patients in the general population .",3
"Breast cancer trial participants aged 75 years or older do not represent elderly breast cancer patients of corresponding age from the general population , which hampers the external validity of a trial .",4
Recruitment and attrition data supported feasibility .,3
"Program evaluations for process ( e.g. , ease of participation ) and content ( e.g. , relevance ) demonstrated acceptability .",3
Engaging in intimacy-building activities and communication were the skills rated as most commonly practiced and most helpful .,3
"For patients , positive effects of the IE intervention were found for female and male sexual function , medical impact on sexual function , and self-efficacy for enjoying intimacy ( .58 ) ; no effects were found on sexual distress or intimacy and small negative effects for sexual communication , and two self-efficacy items .",3
"For partners , positive IE effects were found for all outcomes ; the largest were for sexual distress ( .69 ) , male sexual function ( 1.76 ) , communication ( .97 ) , and two self-efficacy items ( .87 ) .",3
The telephone-based IE intervention shows promise for couples facing colorectal cancer .,4
Larger multi-site intervention studies are necessary to replicate findings .,4
"Between disability stages of EDSS 0-2 .5 and EDSS 3.0-4 .0 , the mean TTW difference was 4s ( T25FW = 0.9 s ) .",3
"The accuracy to separate between EDSS groups was moderate but identical for both tests ( ROC-AUC T25FW = 0.79 , TTW = 0.80 , p = 0.4 ) .",3
"TTW had a higher sensitivity and specificity to differentiate between asymptomatic and symptomatic patients concerning FS motor/cerebellar scores ( ROC-AUC T25FW = 0.71 , TTW = 0.75 , p < 0.05 ) .",3
All hypotheses could be validated in the second cohort .,3
A 3-m Timed Tandem Walk is a standardized test that is easy to implement to detect impairment of the motor or cerebellar system in fully ambulatory MS patients .,4
"Based on the complex-task character , TTW is a potential new outcome measure for MS mobility in mildly disabled patients and can act as easily accessible and significant additional information in patient counseling .",4
Fifty-two patients were enrolled .,3
Three patients were excluded due to incomplete follow up ( n = 2 ) and postoperative course requiring early unblinding ( n = 1 ) .,3

"In the combined group , ultrasound detected all the 14 cancers , whereas mammography detected 8 , making ultrasound more sensitive ( 100 vs 57.1 % , P = 0.04 ) with a better diagnostic accuracy ( 0.999 vs 0.766 , P = 0.01 ) .",3
"There was no difference between mammography and ultrasound in specificity ( 100 vs 99.9 % , P = 0.51 ) and positive predictive value ( 72.7 vs 70.0 % ; P = 0.87 ) .",3
"To detect one cancer , the costs of ultrasound , mammography , and combined modality were $ 7876 , $ 45253 , and $ 21599 , respectively .",3
Ultrasound is superior to mammography for breast cancer screening in high-risk Chinese women .,4
Pain scores were revealed in this order : Group 1 ( steroid ) < Group 2 ( levobupivacaine ) < Group 3 ( saline ) at all times ( p = 0.000 ) .,3
"The anesthesia times for Group 1 and Group 2 were different ( steroid vs. levobupivacaine ) , and the time to first analgesic was longer in Groups 1 ( steroid ) and 2 ( levobupivacaine ) than in Group 3 ( saline ) ( p < 0.000 ) .",3
"The total number of analgesic interventions was lower in Group 1 ( steroid ) than in Group 2 ( levobupivacaine ) and Group 3 ( saline ) ( steroid vs. saline , p = 0.000 , and steroid vs. levobupivacaine , p < 0.05 ) .",3

"HIV-1-specific T-cell frequencies in interferon - ELISPOT assay were transiently higher in the MVA.HIVA arm ( p = 0.002 ) , but not above the threshold for a positive assay .",3
"Protective antibody levels were adequate and similar between arms for all routine childhood vaccines except HBV , where 71 % of MVA.HIVA subjects compared to 92 % of control subjects were protected ( p = 0.05 ) .",3
"This trial tested for the first time an MVA-vectored candidate HIV-1 vaccine in HIV-1-exposed infants in Africa , demonstrating trial feasibility and vaccine safety , low immunogenicity , and compatibility with routine childhood vaccinations .",4
These results are reassuring for use of the MVA vector in more potent prime-boost regimens .,4
No significant difference was found between the groups in terms of demographic data .,3
The time to reach T 10 sensory block and the time of starting motor block were found to be significantly shorter in Group II .,3
"The duration of sensory block over T 10 and T 6 , the duration of L 1 regression , the duration of the sensory block , and the regression time of the motor blocks from 3 to 2 were found to be longer in Group II .",3

All groups had low seroprotection/seropositivity rates ( < 10 % ) before vaccination for all antigens .,3
"Forty two days after vaccination , on either Study Day 42 or 84 , seroconversion rates for all antigens were high in all groups , irrespective of the order of vaccinations .",3
Seroconversion for JE ranged from 96.9 % in Group Co-Ad on D42 to 100 % in Group MMR .,3
Non-inferiority was demonstrated for all analyses as the lower bound of the 95 % CI of the difference in seroconversion rates between groups was above the pre-defined limit of -10.0 % .,3
The immune responses remained high for all antigens and well above the level of protection 12 months after vaccination in all groups .,3
There were no safety concerns .,3
JE-CV is safe and induces a strong protective immune response which persists over 1 year when co-administered with MMR vaccine .,4
Evaluation of intra-operatively pain shows that minimal pain is the same in both groups .,3
Mild pain was more frequent in the group who used levobupivacaine .,3
Moderate pain was slightly more frequent in the group who used bupivacaine .,3
Only one reported intense pain .,3
"Two drugs seem to have the same effect at a distance of six , twelve , eighteen and twentyfour hours .",3
"Bupivacaine shows a significantly higher number of complications , as already demonstrated by previous studies .",3
Degree of satisfaction expressed by patients has been the same in the two groups .,3
Levobupivacaine group has shown a greater request for paracetamol while patients who experienced bupivacaine have showed a higher request of other analgesics .,3
"Clinical efficacy of levobupivacaine and racemic bupivacaine are actually similar , when used under local intervention of inguinal hernioplasty .",4
In the field of ambulatorial surgery our working group prefers levobupivacaine for its fewer side effects and for its easy handling .,4
"In Group I at 12 months , the bone graft mass was assessed in X-rays as fused in no cases ( 0 % ) and at 24 months in four cases ( 10 % ) .",3
"In Group II , 6 cases ( 15 % ) achieved fusion at 12 months and 14 cases ( 35 % ) at 24 months .",3

"There were no significant differences with respect to either CS or severe CS between the two treatment groups at 1 , 6 , or 12months of follow-up .",3
The total scores of the quality-of-life questionnaires after surgery were remarkably decreased compared with those before surgery in the two groups .,3
"However , no significant differences in quality-of-life scores were found between the two groups before surgery , or at 1 , 6 , or 12months of follow-up .",3
Age was predictive of severe CS at 6months of follow-up ( P = 0.045 ) .,3
"Severe CS was inversely associated with patient satisfaction at 1 , 6 , and 12months of follow-up .",3
The issue of whether lowering or restricting the level of sympathectomy reduces CS is controversial and needs more supportive evidence .,4
Age may be a predictive factor for severe CS at 6 and 12months of follow-up .,4
"Severe CS is the only known factor that affects patient satisfaction , and family history may also be associated with patient satisfaction .",4
"The 1 - , 2 - , and 3-year OS rates were 76.1 % , 63.5 % , and 51.5 % , respectively , for the PH group compared with 51.8 % , 34.8 % , and 18.1 % , respectively , for the TACE group ( Log-rank test , ( 2 ) = 24.246 , p < 0.001 ) .",3

PH provided better OS for patients with RMHCC outside of Milan Criteria than conventional TACE .,4
The number of tumor and gender were also independent risk factors associated with OS for RMHCC .,4
"At 24 weeks , 21.7 % of participants in the standard treatment arm were abstinent , compared with 27.2 % of participants in the extended and maintenance treatment arms ( ( 2 ) ( 1 ) = 1.98 ; P = .17 ) .",3
"In a multivariate model controlled for covariates , participants in the extended and maintenance treatment arms reported significantly greater abstinence rates at 24 weeks compared with participants in the standard treatment arm ( odds ratio [ OR ] , 1.70 [ 95 % CI , 1.03-2 .81 ] ; P = .04 ) , had a longer duration of abstinence until relapse ( = 21.30 [ 95 % CI , 10.30-32 .25 ] ; P < .001 ) , reported smoking fewer cigarettes per day if not abstinent ( mean [ SD ] , 5.8 [ 5.3 ] vs 6.4 [ 5.1 ] cigarettes per day ; = 0.43 [ 95 % CI , 0.06-0 .82 ] ; P = .02 ) , and reported more abstinent days ( mean [ SD ] , 80.5 [ 38.1 ] vs 68.2 [ 43.7 ] days ; OR , 1.55 [ 95 % CI , 1.06-2 .26 ] ; P = .02 ) .",3
"At 52 weeks , participants in the maintenance treatment arm did not report significantly greater abstinence rates compared with participants in the standard and extended treatment arms ( 20.3 % vs 23.8 % ; OR , 1.17 [ 95 % CI , 0.69-1 .98 ] ; P = .57 ) .",3
"Similarly , we found no difference in week 52 abstinence rates between participants in the extended and standard treatment arms ( 26.0 % vs 21.7 % ; OR , 1.33 [ 95 % CI , 0.72-2 .45 ] ; P = .36 ) .",3
"Treatment duration was not associated with any adverse effects or adherence to the counseling regimen , but participants in the maintenance treatment arm reported lower adherence to the nicotine patch regimen compared with those in the standard and extended treatment arms ( mean [ SD ] , 3.94 [ 2.5 ] , 4.61 [ 2.0 ] , and 4.7 [ 2.4 ] patches/wk , respectively ; F2 ,522 = 6.03 ; P = .003 ) .",3
"The findings support the safety of long-term use of nicotine patch treatment , although they do not support efficacy beyond 24 weeks of treatment in a broad group of smokers .",4
"Of 121 HIV seroconverters , 25 received FTC/TDF , 38 received TDF , and 58 received placebo .",3
"Plasma drug levels in 26 individuals indicated PrEP use during or after HIV acquisition , of which 5 had virus with resistance mutations associated with their PrEP regimen .",3
"Among those with PrEP drug detected during infection , resistance was more frequent in the FTC/TDF arm ( 4 of 7 [ 57 % ] ) , compared with the TDF arm ( 1 of 19 [ 5.3 % ] ; P = .01 ) , owing to the FTC-associated mutation M184IV .",3
"Of these cases , 3 had unrecognized acute infection at PrEP randomization , and 2 were HIV negative at enrollment .",3
These results suggest that resistance selected by PrEP is rare but can occur both with PrEP initiation during acute seronegative HIV infection and in PrEP breakthrough infections and that FTC is associated with a greater frequency of resistance mutations than TDF .,4
Forty-eight children were followed for a mean of 28 months ( range 12-42 ) beyond the end of the TREAT study .,3
Half of patients were in CID for > 50 % of their followup time .,3

We identified heart transplant patients who received atropine during DSE from January 1984 to August 2011 at our institution and compared them with a propensity-scored matched control group of heart transplant patients who underwent DSE without atropine .,3
"Adverse events were defined as significant arrhythmias ( sinus arrest , Mobitz type II heart block , complete heart block , ventricular tachycardia , or ventricular fibrillation ) , hypotension requiring hospitalization , syncope or presyncope , myocardial infarction , and death .",3
"Forty-five heart transplant patients ( median age 62 years , 82 % male ) received 0.2-1 mg atropine during DSE .",3
"Of these , 1 patient ( 2.2 % ) developed temporary complete heart block .",3
No adverse events were identified in the control group of 154 patients who received dobutamine without atropine .,3
Our findings suggest that complete heart block can occur infrequently with the administration of atropine in heart transplant patients undergoing DSE .,4
"Therefore , patients should be appropriately monitored for these adverse events during and after DSE .",4
CI-AKI occurred in 8/116 patients ( 6.9 % ) in the oral hydration group and 8/109 patients ( 7.3 % ) in the IV hydration group ( p = 0.89 ) .,3
There was also no statistically significant difference between the two groups when different CI-AKI definitions were taken into account .,3
"Oral hydration is as effective as IV hydration in preventing CI-AKI in patients with normal kidney function or stage 1-2 chronic kidney disease , and who also have at least one of the other high-risk factors for developing CI-AKI .",4
"Better functional outcome was observed in the BCI group , including a significantly higher probability of achieving a clinically relevant increase in the FMA score ( p < 0.03 ) .",3
"Post-BCI training changes in EEG sensorimotor power spectra ( ie , stronger desynchronization in the alpha and beta bands ) occurred with greater involvement of the ipsilesional hemisphere in response to MI of the paralyzed trained hand .",3
"Also , FMA improvements ( effectiveness of FMA ) correlated with the changes ( ie , post-training increase ) at rest in ipsilesional intrahemispheric connectivity in the same bands ( p < 0.05 ) .",3

"These results suggest that providing smoking-cessation treatment to illicit stimulant-dependent patients in outpatient substance use disorder treatment will not worsen , and may enhance , abstinence from nonnicotine substance use .",4
"Combined high tibial osteotomy modification avoids metaphyseal tibial bone loss , decreasing transposition of the tibial condyle and shortening of the patellar tendon after osteotomy , even in case of great correction .",4
The clinical results of the combined wedge osteotomy technique are very promising .,4
Hypothesis is that the combined wedge osteotomy technique will achieve more accurate overcorrection of varus malalignment with fewer anatomical changes of the proximal tibia after one year .,4
There were no statistical differences between the control group and other groups in the visual analog scale or changes in heart rate .,3
Changes in blood pressure were similar .,3
Participants reported good overall experiences .,3
"There were no differences in terms of overall satisfaction , pain rating , willingness to repeat the computed tomography colonography procedure in the future , or preference between colonoscopy and computed tomography colonography .",3
More participants using music and/or aroma requested music and/or aroma during the next computed tomography colonography ( P < 0.0001 ) .,3
"Although audio and olfactory intervention had little effect on perceived pain or discomfort and vital signs , participants who listened to music and inhaled aroma during the computed tomography colonography preferred music and aroma during the next computed tomography colonography .",4
"Among MLCu375 users , women with LTD 27 mm had a higher risk of expulsion or displacement ( aOR 2.40 ; 95 % confidence interval , 95 % CI , 1.02-5 .63 ) , after adjusting for the volume of menstrual flow , dysmenorrhoea , parity , uterine position , MLCu375 type , and LUC .",3
"Among TCu380A users , the association between LTD 37 mm and expulsion or displacement ( aOR 4.98 ; 95 % CI 1.01-22 .49 ) was statistically significant , after adjusting for LUC and potential confounding factors .",3
Our study suggests that LTD should be considered when making the decision of which IUD model to use .,4
It was found that in 91 % 1.8 % of randomly chosen patients ( p < 0.05 ) mouth cavity microflora showed apparent urease activity .,3
The lowest concentration ( 0.0625 % in 50 ml ) and volume ( 0.5 ml of 1 % solution ) levels of urea solution were obtained that can exert negative influence on the results of helicobacteriosis diagnosis by means of mouth cavity air analysis .,3
Urealytic microflora in the mouth cavity is very common and may constitute a factor that decreases the specificity of helicobacteriosis diagnosis by means of the methods based on detection of indicators of gas metabolites resulting from the enzymatic reaction in air samples taken from the mouth cavity after oral administration of urea .,4
The robot-guided and unassisted groups generally exhibited comparable changes in endpoint accuracy and precision .,3
"Kinematic analyses revealed that only participants who practiced with the robot exhibited significantly reduced the proportion of movement time spent during the limb deceleration phase ( i.e. , time after peak velocity ) .",3
This was true regardless of online visual feedback availability during training .,3
The influence of robot-assisted motor skill acquisition is best explained by improved motor planning processes .,4
15.4 % of the patients had at least one C-allele ( three were C homozygotes ) .,3
There was no correlation between genotype and protein expression .,3
"Patients who were G homozygotes benefitted from radiotherapy with decreased risk of local recurrences ( RR = 0.32 , 95 % C.I. 0.16-0 .64 , p = 0.001 ) .",3
"CMF chemotherapy reduced the risk of distant recurrence for patients carrying at least one C-allele ( RR = 0.29 , 95 % C.I. 0.10-0 .88 , p = 0.03 ) , whereas G homozygotes had no benefit from chemotherapy .",3
There was a significant interaction between chemotherapy and genotype ( p = 0.02 ) .,3
The results suggest that the RAD51 135G > C polymorphism predicts CMF chemotherapy effect in early breast cancer .,4
"The intervention group reported improvement in overall function ( p = 0.016 ) , as well as in basic ( p = 0.044 ) and advanced lower extremity function ( p = 0.025 ) compared with the control group .",3

No statistical difference was found among the 3 groups regarding 3 different memory tests although 67.5 % [ 50.7 % ; 80.9 % ] of the patients of the high-opioid group and 72.5 % [ 55.9 % ; 84.9 % ] of the low-opioid group had at least 1 episode of BIS > 60 .,3
We could not demonstrate the presence of implicit or explicit memorization under propofol-remifentanil anesthesia either with a low - or a high-dose opioid anesthetic regimen .,4
We randomised 36 statin treated CVD patients and 36 healthy volunteers in a 21 treatment allocation ratio to either 7 mg lycopene or placebo daily for 2 months in a double-blind trial .,3
"Forearm responses to intra-arterial infusions of acetylcholine ( endothelium-dependent vasodilatation ; EDV ) , sodium nitroprusside ( endothelium-independent vasodilatation ; EIDV ) , and NG-monomethyl-L-arginine ( basal nitric oxide ( NO ) synthase activity ) were measured using venous plethysmography .",3
A range of vascular and biochemical secondary endpoints were also explored .,3
"EDV in CVD patients post-lycopene improved by 53 % ( 95 % CI : +9 % to +93 % , P = 0.03 vs. placebo ) without changes to EIDV , or basal NO responses .",3
HVs did not show changes in EDV after lycopene treatment .,3
"Blood pressure , arterial stiffness , lipids and hsCRP levels were unchanged for lycopene vs. placebo treatment groups in the CVD arm as well as the HV arm .",3
"At baseline , CVD patients had impaired EDV compared with HV ( 30 % lower ; 95 % CI : -45 % to -10 % , P = 0.008 ) , despite lower LDL cholesterol ( 1.2 mmol/L lower , 95 % CI : -1.6 to -0.9 mmol/L , P < 0.001 ) .",3
"Post-therapy EDV responses for lycopene-treated CVD patients were similar to HVs at baseline ( 2 % lower , 95 % CI : -30 % to +30 % , P = 0.85 ) , also suggesting lycopene improved endothelial function .",3
"Lycopene supplementation improves endothelial function in CVD patients on optimal secondary prevention , but not in HVs .",4
"Overall , 362 patients were available for the efficacy analysis ( 181 in each treatment arm ) .",3
"Significantly more patients receiving aprepitant reached the primary end point ( 58 % v 41 % ; odds ratio [ OR ] , 1.92 ; 95 % CI , 1.23 to 3.00 ; P = .0042 ) .",3
"Absence of major nausea ( 94 % v 88 % ; OR , 2.37 ; 95 % CI , 1.09 to 5.15 ; P = .026 ) and emesis ( 78 % v 65 % ; OR , 1.99 ; 95 % CI , 1.25 to 3.18 ; P = .0036 ) within 120 hours was increased by aprepitant .",3
Mean total FLIE score ( standard deviation ) was 114 18 for aprepitant and 106 26 for placebo ( P < .001 ) .,3
The addition of aprepitant resulted in significantly less CINV and had a positive effect on quality of life .,4
Two hundred and fifty-seven women with primary SUI were scheduled to receive TVT-O or C-NDL and were followed up at least 3 years after the procedure .,3
"One hundred and eleven women in the C-NDL group ( 84.7 % ) had a negative stress test , compared with 54 women ( 88.9 % ) in the TVT-O group ( p = 0.0065 for the non-inferiority test ) .",3
The postoperative Sandvik Severity Index was 0 or better than the preoperative score in 90.7 % of patients in the C-NDL group and 95.4 % of patients in the TVT-O group ( p = 0.0022 ) .,3
The complication rate was similar in both groups .,3
There were significant differences ( p = 0.02 ) in postoperative pain within the TVT-O group .,3
The degree of satisfaction was not statistically significant between the two groups .,3
"The outcomes for the C-NDL group were similar to those of the TVT-O group , adding the concept of `` single incision tape '' to the tension-free sling option .",4
"There was no significant difference in the intra-abdominal abscess rate , which was 0.0 % with Group A and 1.3 % with Group B ( P = 0.319 ) .",3
The median subhepatic fluid collection was 4.1 mL ( 1.160 mL ) in Group A and 4.5 mL ( 1.180.0 mL ) in Group B ( P = 0.298 ) .,3
"However , the median hospital stay was 2 days ( 14 days ) in Group B and 3 days ( 27 days ) in group A ( P = 0.001 ) .",3
The subgroup of empyema patients did not have any significant differences in intra-abdominal fluid collection or intra-abdominal abscess rate .,3
This study suggests that postoperative routine drainage of the abdominal cavity for acute cholecystitis does not prevent intra-abdominal infections .,4
"Fexinidazole was well-tolerated in a single dose from 100 to 3,600 mg , with quick absorption of the parent drug and rapid metabolism into sulfoxide [ time to maximum concentration ( t max ) 2-5 h ] and sulfone ( t max 18-24 h ) .",3
"The tablet formulation was approximately 25 % less bioavailable than the suspension , and food intake increased drug absorption and plasma concentrations of fexinidazole and its two metabolites by approximately 200 % .",3
"Fourteen-day multiple ascending dosing administered up to 3,600 mg/day in fasted conditions showed that fexinidazole was generally well-tolerated ( mild to moderate , spontaneously reversible drug-related adverse events ) .",3
"Following the high-fat food effect finding , another study was conducted to evaluate the impact of a low-fat regimen closer to that of the target population , showing that the type of meal does not influence fexinidazole absorption .",3
"The last study showed that a loading dose of 1,800 mg/day for 4 days followed by a 1,200 mg/day regimen for 6 days with a normal meal provided the desired exposure of fexinidazole and its metabolites , particularly sulfone , with good tolerability .",3
"Based on preclinical evidence from a chronic infection mouse model , systemic drug concentrations obtained are expected to be clinically effective in stage 2 HAT .",3
These studies show that fexinidazole can be safely assessed in patients as a potential oral cure for both stages of HAT .,4
"All 8 investigational A/H1N1 vaccine formulations were well tolerated , and rapidly induced high antibody titers which met all of the Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research ( CBER ) and Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use ( CHMP ) licensure criteria 3 weeks after one dose .",3
The highest antibody titers were observed in participants vaccinated with higher quantities of antigen and adjuvant .,3
A single vaccine dose containing 3.75 g of A/California/7 / 2009 ( H1N1 ) antigen with MF59 adjuvant was identified as optimal for young to middle-aged ( 18-64 years ) and older ( 65 years ) adult populations .,4
Of 427 patients enrolled 315 were randomized and treated .,3
"Decreases from baseline in I-PSS were observed in the onabotulinumtoxinA and placebo groups ( -6.3 vs -5.6 points , p < 0.001 ) with no difference between the groups overall or in subgroups .",3
"Improvement was observed in the peak urinary flow rate , which was significant only at week 6 compared to placebo .",3
Improvement was significant at all time points in a patient subgroup on stable concurrent - blockers or 5-reductase inhibitors during the study .,3
Adverse events were similar in the 2 treatment groups .,3
OnabotulinumtoxinA 200 U and placebo improved I-PSS and were well tolerated but no between group difference in efficacy was observed .,4
"Four hundred thirty-four patients were randomized to EVT , 269 ( 62 % ) were treated under local anesthesia and 147 ( 33.9 % ) under GA ; 18 ( 4 % ) were undetermined .",3
The 2 groups were comparable except for median baseline NIHSS ( 16 local anesthesia versus 18 GA ; P < 0.0001 ) .,3
"The GA group was less likely to achieve a good outcome ( adjusted relative risk , 0.68 ; confidence interval , 0.52-0 .90 ; P = 0.0056 ) and had increased in-hospital mortality ( adjusted relative risk , 2.84 ; confidence interval , 1.65-4 .91 ; P = 0.0002 ) .",3
"Those with medically indicated GA had worse outcomes ( adjusted relative risk , 0.49 ; confidence interval , 0.30-0 .81 ; P = 0.005 ) and increased mortality ( relative risk , 3.93 ; confidence interval , 2.18-7 .10 ; P < 0.0001 ) with a trend for higher mortality with routine GA. .",3
There was no significant difference in the adjusted risks of subarachnoid hemorrhage ( P = 0.32 ) or symptomatic intracerebral hemorrhage ( P = 0.37 ) .,3
GA was associated with worse neurological outcomes and increased mortality in the EVT arm ; this was primarily true among patients with medical indications for GA. .,4
"Relative risk estimates , though not statistically significant , suggest reduced risk for subarachnoid hemorrhage and symptomatic intracerebral hemorrhage under local anesthesia .",4
"Although the reasons for these associations are not clear , these data support the use of local anesthesia when possible during EVT .",4
"The occurrence rate of sneezing reflex was 85.7 % ( 36/42 ) in the observation group , which was higher than 25.0 % ( 10/40 ) in the control group ( P < 0.01 ) .",3
"The average resuscitation time was ( 64.6 + / - 19.4 ) days in the observation group , which was obviously shorter than ( 73.8 + / - 14.6 ) days in the control group ( P < 0.05 ) .",3
"The resuscitation rate was 88.1 % ( 37/42 ) in the observation group , which was similar to 75.0 % ( 30/40 ) in the control group ( P > 0.05 ) .",3
"Compared before the treatment , GCS were both improved after the treatment in two groups ( both P < 0.01 ) .",3

"The curative and markedly effective rate was 45.2 % ( 19/42 ) in the observation group , which was superior to 22.5 % ( 9/40 ) in the control group ( P < 0.05 ) .",3
The effect of acupuncture at Suliao ( GV 25 ) on improving regain of consciousness from coma in severe craniocerebral injury is positive .,4
"It could specifically improve sneezing reflex and stimulate respiratory center , which has more obvious effect than acupuncture at Shuigou ( GV 26 ) .",4
"Birth weight , birth length , small for gestational age as a proxy for intrauterine growth retardation , and preterm birth were significantly related to date of birth and showed important seasonal variations .",3
"LNSs , which supply energy in addition to MMNs , resulted in a significant increase in birth length ( +13.5 mm , 95 % CI : 6.5 , 20.5 mm ) at the transition from rain to dry season ( September to November ) compared to MMNs alone .",3
The climatologic and agricultural seasonal patterns in Burkina Faso affect the efficacy of prenatal LNSs on birth length .,4
"In this context , prenatal MMN supplementation programs should be complemented by energy supplementation during the annual rain season to promote fetal growth .",4
This trial was registered at clinicaltrials.gov as NCT00909974 .,4
"TIMI flow grade post PCI did not differ between the 2 groups , while CTFC favored the adenosine-treated patients [ ( 21.6 6.5 ) frames ] compared with the placebo-treated patients [ ( 25.1 7.8 ) frames , P = 0.001 ] .",3
"MBG 3 was more frequently observed in the adenosine compared to the control group [ 45.1 % ( 55/122 ) vs. 32.0 % ( 39/122 ) , P = 0.035 ] .",3

"Based on an intent-to-treat analysis , an objective response rate of 30 % ( 95 % confidence interval [ CI ] , 16.6-46 .5 ) was observed in the monotherapy arm , and 35.9 % ( 95 % CI , 21.2-52 .8 ) in the combination arm .",3
Median progression-free survival was 4.1 months in both treatment groups .,3
Safety findings were consistent with the known individual toxicity profiles of ixabepilone and cetuximab .,3
"Skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders were more common with combination therapy , as were discontinuations because of adverse events .",3
"Ixabepilone monotherapy and the ixabepilone and cetuximab combination demonstrated similar levels of clinical activity in first-line treatment of advanced TNBC , with a predictable safety profile .",4
Further investigation of novel therapies for TNBC is required to improve patient outcomes .,4
"Comparing highest to lowest quartiles , DBP was not associated with colorectal cancer risk ( OR = 0.91 ; 95 % CI : 0.58 , 1.42 , p for trend = 0.58 ) ; however , a positive risk association was observed for the molar ratio of 25 ( OH ) D : DBP ( OR = 1.44 ; 95 % CI : 0.92 , 2.26 , p for trend = 0.04 ) .",3
"In stratified analyses , the positive association between 25 ( OH ) D and colorectal cancer was stronger among men with DBP levels above the median ( OR = 1.89 ; 95 % CI : 1.07 , 3.36 , p for trend = 0.01 ) than below the median ( OR = 1.20 ; 95 % CI : 0.68 , 2.12 , p for trend = 0.87 ) , although the interaction was not statistically significant ( p for interaction = 0.24 ) .",3
"Circulating DBP may influence the association between 25 ( OH ) D and colorectal cancer in male smokers , with the suggestion of a stronger positive association in men with higher DBP concentrations .",4
"This finding should be examined in other populations , especially those that include women and non-smokers .",4

"At present , the indication for each different therapy is not well defined , and the effectiveness of different modalities is unknown .",4
"The mean age of the participants was 58 years ; men and women were equally represented , and baseline 24-h BP ( 153-154/93 mmHg ) and clinic BP ( 165-166/94 -95 mmHg ) were similar across the three treatment groups .",3
"After 6 weeks , 24-h BP decreased by 25/15 mmHg in both the azilsartan medoxomil/amlodipine 40/5 and 80/5 mg groups .",3
These reductions were each greater than the 14/8 mmHg decrease with placebo plus amlodipine 5 mg ( P0 .001 for both comparisons ) .,3
"All treatments were well tolerated , and adverse events did not increase with the azilsartan medoxomil doses .",3
Edema or fluid retention was less common in both combination groups ( 2.6 and 2.7 % ) than with placebo plus amlodipine ( 7.6 % ) .,3
Coadministration of azilsartan medoxomil with amlodipine was well tolerated and led to meaningful additional BP reductions compared with placebo plus amlodipine .,4
"Compared with baseline findings , hemorrhagic shock resulted in decreases in all microvascular variables in the buccal mucosa and the jejunal serosa .",3
"At all time points following HBOC administration , microvascular variables were similar to initial values and no significant differences between treatment groups were detected .",3
"At all time points following HBOC administration , blood and plasma viscosities in dogs treated with the hyperviscous solution were significantly higher than values in dogs receiving the standard solution .",3
"In splenectomized dogs with experimentally induced hemorrhagic shock , administration of a hyperviscous HBOC did not significantly affect microvascular variables , compared with effects of a standard HBOC .",4
"Microcirculatory flow returned to baseline values in both treatment groups , suggesting that marked HBOC-associated vasoconstriction did not occur .",4

"No difference was found in the indwelling EVD time , the time for monitoring in the ICU .",3
"Through repeated measurements of the variance analysis , the test for a difference in IVH volume over time was statistically significant ( F = 466.981 , p = 0.000 ) and the test for the interaction between treatment and time was also significant ( F = 5.033 , p = 0.002 ) , indicating that the IVH volume decreased over time in both groups , with a sharper decrease in Group II .",3
Intracranial re-haemorrhage and infection was not found in this study .,3

The Breast-Q results indicated a tremendous improvement in the modules `` Satisfaction with Breast '' and `` Psychosocial Well-being '' .,3
The `` Sexual Well-being '' scale also improved .,3
Only the module `` Satisfaction with Breasts '' significantly differed between groups ; patients treated with the PureGraft fat exhibited better outcomes .,3
The BCCT.core results did not significantly differ between the groups .,3
"One year postoperatively , the outcomes of the use of PureGraft bags or centrifugation to process fat for breast reconstruction after BCT did not differ .",4
The unpredictability of the results following fatgrafting procedures is likely due to interindividual differences with yet-undisclosed causes .,4
"One hundred twenty-two patients were randomized , 19 patients were excluded from analysis because of early drop-out .",3
"There were no significant differences between both groups in the incidence of SUI and QoL based on the KHQ , IPSS , and pad tests ( P 0.05 ) .",3
In all patients continence was achieved in 77.2 % at 1 year postoperatively .,3

"Within three weeks after initiating withdrawal , handgrip strength improved significantly ( P0 .005 ) compared to baseline values .",3
"Among women , long-term withdrawers improved their handgrip strength both when compared to their baseline values ( P = 0.001 ) or to non-withdrawers ( P = 0.004 ) .",3
"In men , improvement of handgrip strength from baseline was not significantly better in withdrawers than in non-withdrawers .",3
"However , men did improve their handgrip strength values compared to baseline ( P = 0.002 ) .",3
"Compared to balance test results at baseline , withdrawers improved starting from the first week after withdrawal initiation .",3
"There was , however , only a borderline difference ( P = 0.054 ) in balance improvement between the long-term withdrawers and long-term non-withdrawers .",3
"Of note , the non-withdrawers tended to improve their handgrip strength and balance compared to baseline values , in parallel with their reduced benzodiazepine use .",3
Withdrawal from long-term use of benzodiazepines can rapidly improve muscle strength and balance .,4
"Our results encourage discontinuing benzodiazepine hypnotics , particularly in older women who are at a high risk of falling and sustaining fractures .",4

"This was a prospective , double-blinded , randomized study of 291 hypertensive patients with symptomatic paroxysmal AF who were scheduled to undergo pulmonary vein isolation .",3
"Patients were randomly assigned to receive either moxonidine ( 0.2-0 .4 mg daily ) or placebo , along with standard antihypertensive treatment .",3
No significant differences in blood pressure levels were observed between the 2 groups .,3
"In the primary outcome analysis , mean recurrence-free survival was 467 days ( 95 % CI , 445-489 days ) in the moxonidine group as compared with 409 days ( 95 % CI , 381-437 days ) in control subjects ( log rank test , P = 0.006 ) .",3
The calculated 12-month recurrence rate estimates were 36.9 % in the control group and 20.0 % in the moxonidine group ( P = 0.007 ) .,3
"Moxonidine treatment was associated with lower recurrence risk after adjustment for age , body mass index , number of AF episodes in the previous year , and left atrial diameter ( adjusted hazard ratio , 0.35 [ 95 % CI , 0.22-0 .55 ] ; P < 0.001 ) .",3
Treatment with moxonidine is associated with less AF recurrences after ablation treatment for drug-refractory AF in patients with hypertension .,4
The observed effect does not appear to depend on the antihypertensive action of this agent .,4
"To date , only local treatments , for example intradiscal corticosteroid therapy , lumbar arthrodesis or back braces have been studied in randomized , controlled trials , with controversial results .",4
"This trial is currently ongoing and , if conclusive , should provide physicians with an acceptable alternative to those treatments .",4

"From week 12 to week 48 , all groups of patients showed a significant reduction in mean leukocyte counts .",3
"Statistically significant reductions in antibody titers were frequent , but only individuals immunized with CIGB-230 as early add-on treatment sustained the core-IgG response , and the neutralizing antibody response was enhanced only in patients receiving CIGB-230 .",3
"Cell-mediated immune responses also tended to decline , but significant reductions in IFN - secretion and total absence of core-specific lymphoproliferation were exclusive of the control group .",3
Only CIGB-230-immunized individuals showed de novo induced lymphoproliferative responses against the structural antigens .,3
"Importantly , it was demonstrated that the quality of the CIGB-230-induced immune response depended on the number of doses and timing of administration in relation to the antiviral therapy .",3
"Specifically , the administration of 6 doses of CIGB-230 as late add-on to therapy increased the neutralizing antibody activity and the de novo core-specific IFN - secretion , both of which were associated with the sustained virological response .",3
"CIGB-230 , combined with IFN -- based therapy , modifies the immune response in chronic patients .",4
The study provides evidence for the design of more effective therapeutic vaccine interventions against HCV .,4
"At the end of the study , mean levels of serum creatinine , blood urea , and serum cystatin C were significantly lower , whereas creatinine clearance was significantly higher in group ( B ) compared with group ( A ) .",3

"Grading of acute kidney injury according to Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events revealed significantly better renal status among patients in group ( B ) `` grades 0 and 1 in 76 and 24 % of the patients , respectively '' compared with group ( A ) `` grades 0 , 1 , and 2 in 36 , 32 , and 32 % of the patients , respectively '' .",3
"Based on Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors , there was no significant difference between both groups .",3
Cystone can protect cancer patients from cisplatin nephrotoxicity without interfering with its antitumor activity .,4
"In F-URS , the mean stone-free rate was 92 % ( 46 of 50 ) .",3
The mean number of sessions for the SWL group was 1.48 0.65 .,3
Stone-free rate was 90 % ( 45 of 50 ) .,3
"In the observation group , patients were followed up for a mean of 21.02 3.65 months .",3
Three stones passed spontaneously without any symptoms .,3
"Pain developed in 3 patients during follow-up , and 2 of them passed a stone and responded to analgesics without further treatment .",3
"Complication rates for groups 1 and 2 were similar , but group 2 had higher Clavien grades .",3
"For asymptomatic small-sized lower calyceal stones , SWL and F-URS are established treatment modalities .",4
"However , with low auxiliary treatment rates , observation may be an option for the management of nonsymptomatic small-sized lower pole kidney stones .",4
Forty-one participants ( mean age 72.4 years ; 61 % men ) were randomized to etanercept ( n = 20 ) or placebo ( n = 21 ) .,3
Etanercept was well tolerated ; 90 % of participants ( 18/20 ) completed the study compared with 71 % ( 15/21 ) in the placebo group .,3
"Although infections were more common in the etanercept group , there were no serious adverse events or new safety concerns .",3
"While there were some interesting trends that favored etanercept , there were no statistically significant changes in cognition , behavior , or global function .",3
"This study showed that subcutaneous etanercept ( 50 mg/wk ) was well tolerated in this small group of patients with Alzheimer disease dementia , but a larger more heterogeneous group needs to be tested before recommending its use for broader groups of patients .",4
"Participants expressed preferences for an accessible , highly engaging and targeted to pregnancy smoking cessation website , tailored to individuals ' circumstances as well as use of cessation medication , offering comprehensive and novel information on smoking and quitting smoking in pregnancy , ongoing support with cravings management , as well as additional support following relapse to smoking .",3
"Participants also viewed as important targeting of the feedback and progress reports to baby 's health and development , offering personal support from experts , and providing a discussion forum allowing for communication with other pregnant women wanting to quit .",3
The present study has identified a number of potential building blocks for ISCIs targeted to quitting smoking in pregnancy .,4
"Pregnant smokers willing to try using ISCI may particularly value an engaging intervention offering a high degree of targeting of comprehensive information to them as a group and tailoring support and advice to their individual needs , as well as one providing post-relapse support , peer-to-peer communication and personal support from experts .",4
The ghrelin group had a shorter SIRS duration and lower CRP and IL-6 levels than did the placebo group .,3
"The incidence of pulmonary complications was lower in the ghrelin group than in the placebo group , whereas other complications did not differ between the groups .",3
"Although time of the negative nitrogen balance was shorter in the ghrelin group than in the placebo group , changes in total body weight and lean body weight did not differ significantly .",3
Postoperative ghrelin administration was effective for inhibiting inflammatory mediators and improving the postoperative clinical course of patients with esophageal cancer .,4
"A 2 ( condition ) 6 ( time ) repeated measures ANOVA revealed that the EC significantly ( p < 0.05 ) reduced cravings ( ( 2 ) = 0.46 ) compared with the PC , across time .",3
"Non-significant , but nevertheless , large effects were evident favouring the EC over time for TWS restlessness ( ( 2 ) = 0.34 ) , stress ( ( 2 ) = 0.24 ) , irritability ( ( 2 ) = 0.21 ) , tension ( ( 2 ) = 0.15 ) , and depression ( ( 2 ) = 0.14 ) .",3
"Consistent with previous research , this study reveals that in pregnant smokers , a bout of exercise is associated with a reduction in cravings and similar patterns exist for TWS .",4
"Therefore , exercise may have the potential to assist in the initial stages of smoking cessation attempts during pregnancy .",4
"The clinical severity score of AD ( SCORAD value ) of 11 patients who completed AHPT significantly decreased from 79.7 17.0 ( mean SD ) at baseline to 65.8 16.4 at 6 weeks and 60.1 16.0 at 7 weeks ( Wilcoxon signed-rank test , p < 0.05 ) .",3
"There were no significant differences among the SCORAD values measured at baseline ( 74.2 19.6 ) , at 6 weeks ( 66.3 23.6 ) and at 7 weeks ( 67.5 20.8 ) in 10 patients who completed APT ( p > 0.05 ) .",3
This result suggests that the blood component mediating the therapeutic efficacy of ABT in patients with AD might be present in the high-molecular-weight plasma protein fraction .,4
"Greater improvements in most QoL and symptom severity measurements were observed in children randomized to undergo adenotonsillectomy , including the parent-completed Pediatric Quality of Life inventory ( effect size [ ES ] : 0.37 ) , the 18-item Obstructive Sleep Apnea QoL instrument ( ES : -0.93 ) , the modified Epworth Sleepiness Scale score ( ES : -0.42 ) , and the Sleep-Related Breathing Scale of the Pediatric Sleep Questionnaire ( ES : -1.35 ) .",3
Effect modification was not observed by obesity or baseline severity but was noted for race in some symptom measures .,3
Improvements in OSAS severity explained only a small portion of the observed changes .,3
Adenotonsillectomy compared with watchful waiting resulted in significantly more improvements in parent-rated generic and OSAS-specific QoL measures and OSAS symptoms .,4
"Between Jan 29 , 2008 , and June 14 , 2013 , we screened 200 patients and enrolled 199 .",3
"We randomly assigned 100 patients to oral methylprednisolone and 99 patients to intravenous methylprednisolone with a mean time from relapse onset to treatment of 70 days ( SD 36 ) and 74 days ( 39 ) , respectively .",3
"In the per-protocol population , 66 ( 81 % ) of 82 patients in the oral group and 72 ( 80 % ) of 90 patients in the intravenous group achieved the primary endpoint ( absolute treatment difference 05 % , 90 % CI -95 to 104 ) .",3
"Rates of adverse events were similar , but insomnia was more frequently reported in the oral group ( 77 [ 77 % ] ) than in the intravenous group ( 63 [ 64 % ] ) .",3
Oral administration of high-dose methylprednisolone for 3 days was not inferior to intravenous administration for improvement of disability scores 1 month after treatment and had a similar safety profile .,4
"This finding could have implications for access to treatment , patient comfort , and cost , but indication should always be properly considered by clinicians .",4
"We enrolled 60 families , 30 in each study arm ( mean age 8.3 years ) ; 57 % of parents in the intervention group used MyAsthma during at least 5 of the 6 study months .",3
Parents of children with moderate to severe persistent asthma used the portal more than others ; 92 % were satisfied with MyAsthma .,3
"Parents reported that use improved their communication with the office , ability to manage asthma , and awareness of the importance of ongoing attention to treatment .",3
Parents in the intervention group reported that children had a lower frequency of asthma flares and intervention parents missed fewer days of work due to asthma .,3
Use of an EHR-linked asthma portal was feasible and acceptable to families and improved clinically meaningful outcomes .,4
8922 children and 6537 young infants were included in the modified intention-to-treat analyses .,3
Children were followed up for a median of 48 months ( IQR 39-50 ) and young infants for 38 months ( 34-41 ) after dose 1 .,3
"From month 0 until study end , compared with 9585 episodes of clinical malaria that met the primary case definition in children in the C3C group , 6616 episodes occurred in the R3R group ( VE 363 % , 95 % CI 318-405 ) and 7396 occurred in the R3C group ( 283 % , 233-329 ) ; compared with 171 children who experienced at least one episode of severe malaria in the C3C group , 116 children experienced at least one episode of severe malaria in the R3R group ( 322 % , 137 to 469 ) and 169 in the R3C group ( 11 % , -230 to 205 ) .",3
"In young infants , compared with 6170 episodes of clinical malaria that met the primary case definition in the C3C group , 4993 episodes occurred in the R3R group ( VE 259 % , 95 % CI 199-315 ) and 5444 occurred in the R3C group ( 183 % , 117-244 ) ; and compared with 116 infants who experienced at least one episode of severe malaria in the C3C group , 96 infants experienced at least one episode of severe malaria in the R3R group ( 173 % , 95 % CI -94 to 375 ) and 104 in the R3C group ( 103 % , -179 to 318 ) .",3
"In children , 1774 cases of clinical malaria were averted per 1000 children ( 95 % CI 1387-2186 ) in the R3R group and 1363 per 1000 children ( 995-1797 ) in the R3C group .",3
The numbers of cases averted per 1000 young infants were 983 ( 95 % CI 592-1337 ) in the R3R group and 558 ( 158-926 ) in the R3C group .,3
The frequency of SAEs overall was balanced between groups .,3
"However , meningitis was reported as a SAE in 22 children : 11 in the R3R group , ten in the R3C group , and one in the C3C group .",3
"The incidence of generalised convulsive seizures within 7 days of RTS , S/AS01 booster was 22 per 1000 doses in young infants and 25 per 1000 doses in children .",3
"RTS , S/AS01 prevented a substantial number of cases of clinical malaria over a 3-4 year period in young infants and children when administered with or without a booster dose .",4
Efficacy was enhanced by the administration of a booster dose in both age categories .,4
"Thus , the vaccine has the potential to make a substantial contribution to malaria control when used in combination with other effective control measures , especially in areas of high transmission .",4
The physician reported that all devices were very easy to insert .,3
One subject discontinued before the 6-month visit ( at 119 days after insertion ) for a reason not related to the device .,3
"There were no perforations , expulsions , malpositions or complications , or pregnancies .",3
No safety or efficacy concerns were raised .,4
"Due to its form and deployment process the IUB is expected to ease insertion and reduce perforation , malposition and expulsion rates and may also reduce dysmenorrhea and menorrhagia .",4
"Navitoclax was well-tolerated in both studies in healthy volunteers , and did not impose risks beyond the minimal levels expected in healthy volunteer studies .",4
"Compared to a similar study in cancer patients , the studies in healthy volunteers generated higher quality data in a short period of time to support formulation selection .",4
No statistically significant difference was demonstrated between the two groups in terms of Rec Red and complete root coverage ( CRC ) at 6 months and 1 year .,3
"At 5 years , statistically greater recession reduction and probability of CRC , greater increase in buccal KTH and better contour evaluation made by an independent periodontist were observed in the CAF + CTG group .",3
Better post-operative course and better colour match were demonstrated in CAF-treated patients both at 1 and 5 years .,3
CAF + CTG provided better CRC at 5 years ; keloid formation due to graft exposure was responsible for the worse colour match evaluation .,4
"The PK profile of baicelein and baicelin was characterized by a median Tmax of 0.75-3 .5 h and 0.5-3 h , respectively , followed by a multiphasic profile with a t / of 1.90-15 .01 h and 4.22-10 .80 h , respectively .",3
"The estimates of the proportionality coefficient ( 90 % CI ) for Cmax , AUC-t and AUC - were 0.83 ( 0.70-0 .96 ) , 0.91 ( 0.81-1 .00 ) and 0.92 ( 0.82-1 .02 ) , respectively .",3
"All values overlapped within the pre-specified range of ( 0.89-1 .11 ) , ( 0.93-1 .07 ) , and ( 0.93-1 .07 ) , respectively .",3
Dose proportionality was inconclusive for a baicalein dose range of 100-2800 mg .,3
The total urinary clearance of baicalein and baicalin was < 1 % .,3
Approximately 27 % of baicalein was eliminated as unchanged drug in feces .,3
Baicalein was well tolerated .,3
"Eleven treatment-related adverse events were observed , and all were rated as `` mild '' and resolved without further treatment .",3
No serious adverse events occurred .,3
Single oral doses of 100-2800 mg of baicalein were safe and well tolerated by healthy subjects .,4
Clinical laboratory assessments showed no signs of toxicity in the liver or kidney .,4
The favorable safety profile and PK properties warrant further clinical studies for baicalein .,4
"Of the 117 enrolled patients , cont/on-demand was 59/58 and nonerosive reflux disease ( NERD ) / reflux esophagitis ( RE ) before the initial therapy was 35/82 .",3
"Symptom relief in cont/on-demand were 57.6 % / 48.3 % at baseline ( n.s. ) , 66.7 % / 54.7 % at 8 week ( n.s. ) , 64.6 % / 54.7 % at 16 weeks ( n.s. ) , and 66.7 % / 74.0 % at 24 weeks ( n.s. ) .",3
"When subjects were divided into NERD and RE , symptom relief in cont/on-demand were 33.3 % / 41.2 % at baseline ( n.s. ) , 43.8 % / 64.3 % at 8 weeks ( n.s. ) , 50.0 % / 42.9 % at 16 weeks ( n.s. ) , and 50.0 % / 69.2 % at 24 weeks ( n.s. ) in NERD , while those were 68.3 % / 51.2 % at baseline ( n.s. ) , 76.3 % / 51.3 % at 8 weeks ( p < 0.05 ) , 70.6 % / 59.0 % at 16 weeks ( n.s. ) , and 72.7 % / 75.7 % at 24 weeks ( n.s. ) in RE , respectively .",3
"At 24-week EGD , all patients in NERD remained as NERD but number of healed patients was significantly higher in cont ( 85.3 % ) than in on-demand ( 44.4 % ) ( p < 0.01 ) in RE .",3
"Since NERD is defined by symptoms , as a result of the limited efficacy of continuous therapy , on-demand therapy would be sufficient as maintenance therapy in NERD patients .",4
"Regarding RE , continuous therapy would be recommended in terms of reduced symptoms and maintaining mucosal healing .",4
"All primary and secondary end points were achieved ; statistically significant differences favored onabotulinumtoxinA ( p < .001 , all comparisons vs placebo ) .",3
"Investigator and subject responder rates were : CFL , 54.9 % and 45.8 % ; CFL + GL , 59.0 % and 48.5 % ; and placebo , 3.3 % ( both ) , respectively .",3
Responder rates on other end points also significantly favored onabotulinumtoxinA treatments .,3
Most AEs were mild or moderate .,3
Two subjects discontinued : 1 serious AE unrelated to treatment ( myocardial infarction ) and 1 treatment-related AE ( injection site pain ) .,3
OnabotulinumtoxinA was effective and well tolerated for treating moderate-to-severe CFL alone or in combination with GL .,4
Baseline characteristics were similar in all the subgroups .,3
"The post treatment serum TSH ( Group A and C ) returned to normal limits in 85.94 % of verum and 64.29 % of controls ( p < 0.006 ) , while serum AntiTPOab titers ( Group A and B ) returned within normal limits in 70.27 % of verum and 27.02 % controls ( p < 0.05 ) .",3
Eight children ( 10.5 % ) progressed to overt hypothyroidism ( OH ) from control group .,3
A statistically significant decline in serum TSH values and antiTPOab titers indicates that the homeopathic intervention has not only the potential to treat SCH with or without antiTPOab but may also prevent progression to OH .,4
"The mean magnitude of movement of the prostate bed in the anterior-posterior , superior-inferior and left-right planes , respectively , were as follows : upper portion , 0.50 cm , 0.28 cm , 0.10 cm ; lower portion , 0.18 cm , 0.18 cm , 0.08 cm .",3
"The random and systematic errors , respectively , of the prostate bed motion in the anterior-posterior , superior-inferior and left-right planes , respectively , were as follows : upper portion , 0.47 cm and 0.50 cm , 0.28 cm and 0.27 cm , 0.11 cm and 0.11 cm ; lower portion , 0.17 cm and 0.18 cm , 0.17 cm and 0.19 cm , 0.08 cm and 0.10 cm .",3
Most geographic misses occurred in the upper prostate bed in the anterior-posterior plane .,3
The median prostate bed tilt was 1.8 ( range -23.4 to 42.3 ) .,3
Variability was seen in all planes for the movement of both surgical clips .,4
"The greatest movement occurred in the anterior-posterior plane in the upper prostate bed , which could cause geographic miss of treatment delivery .",4
The variability in the movement of the superior and inferior clips indicates a prostate bed tilt that would be difficult to correct with standard online matching techniques .,4
This creates a strong argument for using anisotropic planning target volume margins in post-prostatectomy radiotherapy .,4
"Male and female pattern hair loss are common , chronic dermatologic disorders with limited therapeutic options .",4
"In recent years , a number of commercial devices using low-level laser therapy have been promoted , but there have been little peer-reviewed data on their efficacy .",4
"Seventy-eight , 63 , 49 , and 79 subjects were randomized in four trials of 9-beam lasercomb treatment in female subjects , 12-beam lasercomb treatment in female subjects , 7-beam lasercomb treatment in male subjects , and 9 - and 12-beam lasercomb treatment in male subjects , compared with the sham device , respectively .",3
Nineteen female and 25 male subjects were lost to follow-up .,3
"Among the remaining 122 female and 103 male subjects in the efficacy analysis , the mean terminal hair count at 26 weeks increased from baseline by 20.2 , 20.6 , 18.4 , 20.9 , and 25.7 per cm2 in 9-beam lasercomb-treated female subjects , 12-beam lasercomb-treated female subjects , 7-beam lasercomb-treated male subjects , and 9 - and 12-beam lasercomb-treated male subjects , respectively , compared with 2.8 ( p < 0.0001 ) , 3.0 ( p < 0.0001 ) , 1.6 ( p = 0.0017 ) , 9.4 ( p = 0.0249 ) , and 9.4 ( p = 0.0028 ) in sham-treated subjects ( 95 % confidence interval ) .",3
The increase in terminal hair density was independent of the age and sex of the subject and the lasercomb model .,3
"Additionally , a higher percentage of lasercomb-treated subjects reported overall improvement of hair loss condition and thickness and fullness of hair in self-assessment , compared with sham-treated subjects .",3
No serious adverse events were reported in any subject receiving the lasercomb in any of the four trials .,3
We observed a statistically significant difference in the increase in terminal hair density between lasercomb - and sham-treated subjects .,4
No serious adverse events were reported .,4
Our results suggest that low-level laser treatment may be an effective option to treat pattern hair loss in both men and women .,4
"Additional studies should be considered to determine the long-term effects of low-level laser treatment on hair growth and maintenance , and to optimize laser modality .",4
"Weight , triglyceride levels , and depression scores decreased significantly in NPC when compared to UC but not MIC ; UC and MIC did not differ significantly .",3
Weight loss results maintained at 3-month follow-up : approximately 25 % MIC and NPC patients achieved at least 5 % weight loss which did not differ by BED status .,3
Fidelity ratings were high and treatment adherence was associated with weight loss .,3
This is the first randomized controlled trial in PC testing MI for weight loss to include an attention-control intervention ( NPC ) .,4
"NPC , but not MIC , showed a consistent pattern of superior benefits relative to UC .",4
"BED status was not associated , but treatment adherence was associated , with weight loss outcomes .",4
The scores with the Miller blade lifting the epiglottis and the MAC blade lifting the tongue base were similar .,3
The scores with the Miller blade lifting the epiglottis and the tongue base were similar .,3
The scores for the MAC blade lifting the tongue base were greater than those lifting the epiglottis ( 95 % confidence interval : 7.6-26 .8 ) ( P = 0.0004 ) .,3
"In infants and children < 2 yr of age , optimal laryngeal views may be obtained with either the Miller size 1 blade lifting the epiglottis or with the Miller or MAC blades lifting the tongue base .",4
"Although the presence of biphasic events of the FECG was associated with more interventions for fetal distress and an increased risk of adverse outcome compared with cases with no biphasic events , the presence of significant ( i.e. intervention advised according to cardiotocography interpretation ) biphasic events showed no independent association with interventions for fetal distress [ odds ratio ( OR ) 1.71 , 95 % confidence interval ( CI ) 0.65-4 .50 ] or adverse outcome ( OR 1.96 , 95 % CI 0.74-5 .24 ) .",3
The presence of significant biphasic events did not discriminate in the prediction of interventions for fetal distress or adverse outcome .,4
"Therefore , biphasic events in relation to ST-analysis monitoring during birth should be omitted if future studies confirm our findings .",4
"In multivariable median regression models using backwards selection that started with demographic and clinical variables , older age was associated with higher HRM scores ( higher HIV diversity ) in pol ( P = 0.005 ) and with higher mean ( P = 0.014 ) and median ( P < 0.001 ) HRM scores .",3
"In multivariable models adjusted for age , pre-treatment HIV viral load , pre-treatment CD4 % , and randomized treatment regimen , higher HRM scores in pol were associated with shorter time to virologic suppression ( P = 0.016 ) and longer time to study endpoints ( virologic failure [ VF ] , VF/death , and VF/off study treatment ; P < 0.001 for all measures ) .",3
"In this cohort of sdNVP-exposed , ART-nave African children , higher levels of HIV diversity in the HIV pol region prior to ART initiation were associated with better treatment outcomes .",4
"The baseline plasma ADMA concentrations , carotid arterial compliance , and most other key dependent variables did not differ between the 2 groups .",3
"In the exercise group , carotid arterial compliance significantly increased after exercise intervention ( P < 0.01 ) , and plasma ADMA concentrations significantly decreased ( P < 0.05 ) .",3
"In addition , changes in carotid arterial compliance after the exercise intervention were inversely correlated with changes in plasma ADMA concentrations ( r = -0.367 ; P < 0.05 ) .",3
We demonstrated that aerobic exercise training significantly decreased plasma ADMA concentrations with increase in carotid arterial compliance in postmenopausal women .,4
These results suggest that reduction in ADMA may play an important role in the aerobic exercise training-induced increase in arterial compliance .,4
Both telephone and face-to-face versions of the Engagement and Counseling for Latinos ( ECLA ) were more effective than usual care .,3
"The effect sizes of both intervention conditions on Patient Health Questionnaire-9 were moderate when combined data from both sites are analyzed ( 0.56 and 0.64 for face-to-face and telephone , respectively ) .",3
"Similarly , effect sizes of ECLA-F and ECLA-T on the Hopkins Symptom Checklist were quite large in the Boston site ( 0.64 and 0.73 .",3
respectively ) but not in Puerto Rico ( 0.10 and 0.03 ) .,3
The intervention appears to help Latino patients reduce depressive symptoms and improve functioning .,4
"Of particular importance is the higher treatment initiation for the telephone versus face-to-face intervention ( 89.7 % vs. 78.8 % ) , which suggests that telephone-based care may improve access and quality of care .",4
Marop1 had significantly less vomiting ( 0 % ) compared to Control ( 87 % ; P < .01 ) and Ace ( 53 % ; P < .01 ) .,3
Marop2 had significantly less vomiting ( 27 % ) compared to Control ( P < .01 ) .,3
Marop1 had significantly greater incidence of ptyalism ( 73 % ) compared to Ace ( P < .01 ; 20 % ) .,3
Ace showed significantly less panting ( 33 % ) compared to Marop2 ( 93 % ; P < .01 ) .,3
"In healthy dogs , maropitant citrate administered before hydromorphone significantly decreases the incidence of vomiting in dogs but does not improve signs of nausea , ptyalism , or increased panting .",4
"Between August 2002 and June 2009 , 2106 patients were randomized for completion axillary lymph node dissection ( 1054 patients ) or axillary nodal irradiation ( 1052 patients ) .",3
The two arms were well balanced according to the majority of main prognostic factors .,3
Sentinel lymph node was identified in 2073 patients ( 98.4 % ) and was positive in 526 patients ( 25.4 % ) .,3
"Fifty-two sentinel lymph node-positive patients were excluded from the study ( protocol violation , patient 's preference ) .",3
"Out of the remaining 474 patients , 244 underwent completion axillary lymph node dissection and 230 received axillary nodal irradiation according to randomization .",3
"The mean length of follow-up to the first event and the mean total length of follow-up were 41.9 and 43.3 months , respectively , and there were no significant differences between the two arms .",3
There was no significant difference in axillary recurrence between the two arms ( 0.82 % in arm A and 1.3 % in arm B ) .,3
There was also no significant difference in terms of overall survival between the arms at the early stage follow-up .,3
The authors conclude that after a mean follow-up of more than 40 months axillary nodal irradiation may control the disease in the axilla as effectively as completion axillary lymph node dissection and there was also no difference in terms of overall survival .,4
"The experts achieved an improvement in HIV knowledge and attitudes towards HIV and condom use ; however , experts associated to peers only succeeded in increasing HIV knowledge .",3
The effect size of the changes indicated a greater positive change in the programme when applied by experts than by experts and peers .,3
The participation of peers as co-facilitators did not increase the efficacy of a programme delivered by experts to Spanish adolescents .,4
Education delivered by experts was the most effective modality for reducing sexual risk .,4
COMPAS is the only Spanish programme targeting the promotion of safer sex behaviours in adolescents whose efficacy has been evaluated with different health agents in Spain .,4
( 1 ) All patients got relieved to some degree with the dosage of GC reduced .,3
"The total withdrawal and reduction dosage of GC was slightly higher in the treatment group than in the control group [ ( 50.23 + / - 12.43 ) mg vs ( 48.76 + / - 13.61 ) mg , P > 0.05 ] .",3
"Besides , the prednisone dosage in the treatment group was lower than that in the control group , but without statistical difference ( P > 0.05 ) .",3
"The ratio of patients in need of adding prednisone for aggravating disease was 24.0 % , significantly lower than that in the control group ( 44.44 % , P < 0.05 ) .",3
"( 2 ) There was no statistical difference in the SLEDAI score , inflammatory indicators , liver and renal functions , blood electrolytes , blood glucose , blood and urine routines between the two groups ( P > 0.05 ) .",3
"The 24-h urinary protein count was ( 1.06 + / - 0.22 ) g/L in the treatment group , obviously lower than that in the control group ( 1.43 + / - 0.55 g/L , P < 0.05 ) .",3
"( 3 ) There was no statistical difference in the incidence rate of infection , gastrointestinal hemorrhage , psychoneuroses , Cushing 's syndrome , cardiovascular anomalies , and femoral head necrosis between the two groups ( P > 0.05 ) .",3
"But the incidence of adverse reactions such as insomnia , tidal fever , spontaneous sweat , and obesity was less in the treatment group than in the control group ( P < 0.05 ) .",3
Using a drug pair of Radix Astragali and Rehmanniae Radix combined with GC in treating LN could withdraw the dosage of GC and relieve symptoms it induced .,4
It was advantageous in reducing the dosage of GC and stabilizing patients ' conditions .,4
"The latency period , maximum sensory block level , motor block degree and perioperative analgesia were similar in both groups .",3
Motor block and analgesia had a longer duration in the sufentanil group .,3
Maternal adverse effects and neonatal repercussions were similar .,3
The incidence of hypotension was higher in the fentanyl group .,3
"In both groups , there was a predominance of patients who were awake and either calm or sleepy .",3
"The addition of fentanyl and sufentanil to hyperbaric subarachnoid bupivacaine was shown to be effective for the performance of cesarean section , and safe for the mother and fetus .",4
Analgesia was more prolonged with sufentanil .,4
"Of 681 randomly assigned patients , 671 received treatment .",3
The study was closed early by an independent Data Safety Monitoring Committee because of futility and an increased incidence of serious adverse events ( SAEs ) and treatment-related deaths with figitumumab .,3
"Median OS was 8.6 months for figitumumab plus chemotherapy and 9.8 months for chemotherapy alone ( hazard ratio [ HR ] , 1.18 ; 95 % CI , 0.99 to 1.40 ; P = .06 ) ; median progression-free survival was 4.7 months ( 95 % CI , 4.2 to 5.4 ) and 4.6 months ( 95 % CI , 4.2 to 5.4 ) , respectively ( HR , 1.10 ; P = .27 ) ; the objective response rates were 33 % and 35 % , respectively .",3
The respective rates of all-causality SAEs were 66 % and 51 % ; P < .01 ) .,3

CCE has demonstrated in the in vitro study that it inhibited pancreatic alpha-amylase activity with an IC50 of 25 g/mL .,3
"In the in vivo study , CCE was shown to acutely reduce the glycemic response to starch in a dose-dependent manner in rats .",3
This effect was significant from the dose of 12.5 mg/kg of body weight .,3
"In both , the in vitro and in vivo studies , the hydro-alcoholic extract has shown to be more efficacious than the aqueous extract .",3
"In the human clinical trial , 1 g of CCE lowered the area under the curve of glycemia between 0 and 120 min by 14.8 % ( P = 0.15 ) and between 0 and 60 min by 21.2 % ( P < 0.05 ) compared to the placebo .",3
This effect occurred without stimulating insulin secretion .,3
No adverse effects were reported .,3
These results suggest that Ceylon cinnamon hydro-alcoholic extract ( CCE ) may provide a natural and safe solution for the reduction of postprandial hyperglycemia and therefore help to reduce the risks of developing metabolic disorders .,4
"More blood loss , greater resected adenoma volume , and shorter catheterization duration were recorded in LSP group than that of B-TURP group ( 140.181.5 vs 93.154.0 mL ; 65.313.8 vs 49.012.7 mL ; 3.31.2 vs 3.81.0 days ; p < 0.05 ) .",3

"Total cholesterol , LDL-C , triglycerides , and myeloperoxidase did not change after 6 months since the reduction of statin dosage and the introduction of Berberol ( ) , while they increased in the placebo group , and were higher compared to the ones obtained with active treatment .",3
No patients had serious adverse events in both groups .,3
our study displays the rationale of the combination of Berberol ( ) and a reduced dosage of statin for the treatment of hyperlipidemia in patients intolerant to statins at high dosage .,4
Seven primary research studies from around the world were gathered .,3
"Across all studies , patients in the gum-chewing experimental group both passed flatus and defecated before those in the non-gum-chewing control group .",3
"Where length of stay was studied , patients in all but one experimental group were in the hospital for less time .",3
"These included small sample sizes , lack of blinding in all but one study , differences in standards of care among hospitals and countries represented , unspecified types of gum , and variable timing and frequency of gum chewing among studies .",4
"Patients who chewed gum postoperatively had less POI , passed flatus sooner , had an earlier bowel movement and a shorter length of stay , and were more satisfied .",4
Gum chewing is recommended as adjunctive therapy to reduce postoperative POI .,4
"After the intervention , significant improvement was observed regarding Boston Carpal Tunnel Questionnaire symptomatic severity and functional status mean differences ( p < 0.001 ) in the linseed oil group compared with those in the placebo group .",3
"Also , regarding the mean differences of both groups , significant improvement of nerve conduction velocity of the median nerve was seen in the linseed oil group by a value of 2.38 m/sec ( p < 0.05 ) .",3
"However , motor distal latency and sensory distal latency of the median nerve showed no between-group significant changes ( p = 0.14 for both items ) .",3

EX significantly suppressed subjective appetite responses while increasing thirst and core-body temperature .,3
"Furthermore , EX significantly suppressed ghrelin concentrations and significantly enhanced peptide YY release .",3
Neural responses to images of high-calorie foods significantly increased dorsolateral prefrontal cortex activation and suppressed orbitofrontal cortex ( OFC ) and hippocampus activation after EX compared with REST .,3
"After EX , low-calorie food images increased insula and putamen activation and reduced OFC activation compared with REST .",3
"Furthermore , left pallidum activity was significantly elevated after EX when low-calorie images were viewed and was suppressed when high-calorie images were viewed , and these responses correlated significantly with thirst .",3
Exercise increases neural responses in reward-related regions of the brain in response to images of low-calorie foods and suppresses activation during the viewing of high-calorie foods .,4
These central responses are associated with exercise-induced changes in peripheral signals related to appetite-regulation and hydration status .,4
This trial was registered at www.clinicaltrials.gov as NCT01926431 .,4
The seroconversion rate on Day 28 was 99.2 % in each group .,3
"Noninferiority was demonstrated as the difference between the JE-CV and SA14-14-2 groups was -0.012 percentage points ( 95 % confidence interval : -3.6 to 3.6 ) , which was above the required -10 % .",3
"The seroprotection rate remained very high at Month 6 and comparable between groups , but a slight decrease was observed in the JE-CV group between Months 6 and 12 .",3
Current recommendations for both vaccines call for a booster dose 12-24 months after primary immunization to maintain high seroprotection rates in the long term .,3
"Geometric mean titers ( GMTs ) on Day 28 after vaccination were 507 ( 1/dil ) in the JE-CV group and 370 ( 1/dil ) in the SA14-14-2 group , decreasing by 4.3-fold and 3.6-fold , respectively , to Month 6 before remaining stable to Month 12 and comparable between groups .",3
Solicited reactions were all reported at lower rates after vaccination with JE-CV compared with SA14-14-2 .,3

The most frequent side effects of Dexmedetomidine are bradycardia and arterial hypotension .,4
Induction of anesthesia decreased the stroke volume to 62 % of baseline ( mean ) ; administration of fluids restored this value to 84 % ( starch ) and 68 % ( Ringer 's ) .,3
The optimized stroke volume index was clustered around 35-40 ml/m2/beat .,3
"Additional fluid boluses increased the stroke volume by 10 % ( a sign of fluid responsiveness ) in patients with dehydration , as suggested by a low cardiac index and central venous pressure at baseline and by high urinary osmolality , creatinine concentration and specific gravity .",3
Preloading and the hemodynamic response to induction did not correlate with fluid responsiveness .,3
The blood volume expanded 2.3 ( starch ) and 1.8 ( Ringer 's ) times over the infused volume .,3
Fluid volume optimization did not induce a hyperkinetic state but ameliorated the decrease in stroke volume caused by anesthesia .,4
"Dehydration , but not the hemodynamic response to the induction , was correlated with fluid responsiveness .",4
Intervention patients were much more likely than those in usual care to complete FOBT ( 82.2 % vs 37.3 % ; P < .001 ) .,3
"Of the 185 intervention patients completing screening , 10.2 % completed prior to their due date ( intervention was not given ) , 39.6 % within 2 weeks ( after initial intervention ) , 24.0 % within 2 to 13 weeks ( after automated call/text reminder ) , and 8.4 % between 13 and 26 weeks ( after personal call ) .",3

"PTH increased after exercise on both days ( Ca , P = 0.05 ; control , P = 0.009 ) but was attenuated by Ca supplementation ( 8.3 vs 26.1 pgmL ; P = 0.03 ) .",3
CTX increased only on the control day ( P = 0.02 ) .,3
"In experiment 2 , serum ionized Ca decreased on Ca and control days ( Ca and control , P < 0.001 ) , but less so on the Ca day ( P = 0.04 ) .",3
"PTH ( Ca and control , P < 0.001 ) and CTX ( Ca , P = 0.02 ; control P = 0.007 ) increased on the Ca and control day , and there were no differences in the changes .",3
The timing of Ca supplementation may be a key mediator of Ca homeostasis during acute exercise .,4
Further research is necessary to determine how this influences skeletal adaptations to training .,4
"Forty-two children with congenital hemiplegia ( 29 males , 13 females ; mean age 7y 8mo [ SD 2y 2mo ] ; range 5y 1mo-12y 8mo ; Manual Ability Classification System [ MACS ] I = 20 and II = 22 ; predominant motor type unilateral spastic n = 41 ) participated in the study .",3
Significant gains were seen in COPM performance and satisfaction scores ( p < 0.001 ) post-intervention with no between group differences .,3
Children who had greater persistence with object-oriented tasks ( p = 0.02 ) and better manual ability ( p = 0.03 ) achieved higher COPM performance scores at 13 weeks .,3
Children 's persistence on object-oriented tasks was the strongest predictor of COPM satisfaction ( p = 0.01 ) .,3
Children 's persistence with object-oriented tasks as well as manual abilities needs to be considered when undertaking ULI .,4
"Predetermining children 's motivational predispositions can assist clinicians to tailor therapy sessions individually based on children 's strengths , contributing to effective engagement in ULI .",4
This mixed methods evaluation will provide a detailed understanding of the process of implementing a quality improvement intervention and identify the factors that might influence scalability and sustainability .,4
One hundred four patients were randomized to optimized management ( n = 53 ) or conventional management ( n = 51 ) .,3

"With adjustment for sex , age ( < 30 v 30 years ) , and Children 's Oncology Group-recommended screening frequency group ( annual , 2 years , or 5 years ) , survivors in the APN group were > 2 more likely than those in the control group to complete the recommended cardiomyopathy screening ( RR , 2.31 ; 95 % CI , 1.74 to 3.07 ) .",3
The addition of telephone counseling to an SCP with cardiac health screening recommendations increases cardiomyopathy screening in at-risk survivors .,4
The children in both groups showed significant improvements in the mean values of all measured variables after treatment indexed by a significant reduction in stability indices and improvement in gait parameters .,3
"The results also showed significant differences in all measured parameters in favor of group B , when compared with those in group A ( P < 0.01 ) .",3
Balance training on the Biodex Stability System could be a useful tool in conjunction with traditional physical therapy program for improving balance control and gait functions in children with spastic diplegic cerebral palsy .,4
Kaplan-Meier curve analysis in the validation cohort showed that NCL MACE occurred more frequent ( and equally ) in negative and positive remodeling lesions compared with intermediate remodeling lesions .,3
"In this cohort , negative remodeling lesions had the smallest MLA , positive remodeling lesions had the largest plaque burden , and VH TCFA , especially VH TCFA with multiple necrotic cores , was most common in negatively remodeling lesions .",3
The present study showed the novel concept that positive and negative lesion site remodeling was associated with unanticipated NCL MACE in the PROSPECT study .,4
An Imaging Study in Patients With Unstable Atherosclerotic Lesions [ PROSPECT ] ; NCT00180466 ) .,4
"Seventy-eight and 56 patients were included in the intent-to-treat and per-protocol populations , respectively .",3
"At month 3 , statistically significant IOP reductions from baseline were observed in the bim/tim ( P < 0.01 ) and dorz/brim/tim ( P < 0.0001 ) groups , regardless of assessment time .",3
"At month 6 , patients returned to bim/tim exhibited no significant IOP increase ( regardless of assessment time ) , but patients returned to dorz/brim/tim exhibited a statistically significant IOP increase ( P < 0.001 ) when assessed before instillation of study treatment .",3
Results were similar in both intent-to-treat and per-protocol analysis populations .,3
"In the per-protocol analysis , 70 % of patients on bim/tim at month 3 had an IOP < 14mm Hg , which declined to 58 % ( P = 0.0061 ) at month 6 ( ie , after 3months of dorz/brim/tim treatment ) .",3
"In patients receiving dorz/brim/tim at month 3 , 38 % had an IOP < 14mm Hg , which remained comparable after return to bim/tim .",3
OSDI scores and incidence of adverse events were similar in both groups .,3
"In this first direct comparison of the efficacy of dorz/brim/tim and bim/tim , patients switched from dorz/brim/tim to bim/tim demonstrated improved/lower IOP ; when returned to dorz/brim/tim , IOP increased to levels seen at study initiation , suggesting that once-daily bim/tim may have greater IOP-lowering efficacy .",4
Both bim/tim and dorz/brim/tim were well tolerated with minimal ocular surface damage .,4
"Participants ( 72 % male ) were 84 % white , 45 % were diabetic , 41 % had critical limb ischemia , and 32 % had claudication ( with aneurysm , bypass revision , other ) .",3
"The overall 30-day wound complication incidence was 30 % , with superficial surgical site infection as the most common .",3
"In intent-to-treat analysis , silver alginate had no effect on wound complications .",3
"Multivariable analysis showed that Coumadin ( Bristol-Myers Squibb , Princeton , NJ ; odds ratio [ OR ] , 1.72 ; 95 % confidence interval [ CI ] , 1.03-2 .87 ; P = .03 ) , higher body mass index ( OR , 1.05 ; 95 % CI , 1.01-1 .09 ; P = .01 ) , and the use of no conduit/material ( OR , 0.12 ; 95 % CI , 0.82-3 .59 ; P < .001 ) were independently associated with wound complications .",3
The incidence of wound complications remains high in contemporary open lower extremity arterial surgery .,4

Forty-four patients received sugammadex and 44 received neostigmine .,3
We found lower visual analogue scale pain scores in the SUG group at 30 and 60 minutes after arriving to the PACU ( P < 0.05 ) .,3
We also had less PONV in the SUG group and these patients were also discharged earlier .,3
Sugammadex is associated with less pain felt in the PACU .,4
"This `` opioid-sparing '' effect , combined with less PONV and a faster discharge from the PACU , makes sugammadex an indispensable drug in this type of patients and allows fast-track surgery in the MO. .",4
"There were significant ( P < .05 ) effects of goal setting on both behaviors and of goal group ( tertile of meeting weekly goals ) on behavior , as well as meeting recommendations for both behaviors .",3
There was an increase in FV consumption ( P < .001 ) but no change in PA over time .,3
"Goal setting as part of a Web-based intervention for college students was effective , but results differed for FV and PA. .",4
Goal setting for maintaining behavior may need to differ from goal setting for changing behavior .,4
"Bond strengths ( mean SD ) were : 7.909 3.166 MPa ( group IA ) , 4.675 2.170 MPa ( group IB ) , 8.186 2.766 MPa ( group IIA ) , 4.723 2.084 MPa ( group IIB ) .",3

"The PCR-uncorrected results on days 28 and 42 and the ACPR-corrected results on day 42 were similar for all drugs ( p = 0.62 and p = 0.56 , respectively ) .",3
"AQC resulted in the best parasite clearance and haematological recovery on day 2 ( p = 0.022 and p = 0.018 , respectively ) .",3
Biochemical parameters were not adversely affected by the three artemisinin-based combination therapies ( ACTs ) and these were well tolerated .,3
"The three ACTs were efficacious and safe , but AQC resulted in a better haematological recovery on day 2 and higher cure rates throughout the study period .",4
"At 1-year follow-up , 65 % ( 17/26 ) of the Actifuse cohort and 92 % ( 24/26 ) of the rhBMP-2 cohort demonstrated a radiographical arthrodesis ( P = 0.01 ) .",3
"In both study cohorts , the 1-year postoperative visual analogue scale scores significantly improved ( P < 0.001 ) .",3

"A greater reoperation rate was noted in the Actifuse cohort ( 35.0 % , 9/26 ) compared with the BMP-2 cohort ( 7.7 % , 2/26 ; P = 0.01 ) .",3
"One patient with BMP-2 also experienced symptomatic neuroforaminal bone growth ( 3.8 % , n = 1/26 ) .",3
Silicate-substituted calcium phosphate was associated with a significantly lower rate of arthrodesis than rhBMP-2 in a MIS TLIF .,4
The patients with pseudarthrosis in both cohorts were all clinically symptomatic with an unimproved visual analogue scale score .,4
Additional analysis of Actifuse and other graft enhancers/extenders are needed prior to the utilization for an MIS TLIF .,4
Baseline serum uric acid was similar between groups .,3
Increased serum uric acid was a significant risk factor for 1-year mortality and TtCW .,3
"Compared with placebo , sitaxentan 50 and 100 mg and bosentan all reduced serum uric acid ( p < 0.05 ) .",3
Reduced serum uric acid correlated with increased 6MWD ( p = 0.0037 ) .,3
"Endothelin receptor antagonism reduces serum uric acid in PAH patients , and this reduction is associated with improved survival and longer TtCW .",4
Further prospective studies are needed to investigate the pathogenic role of serum uric acid in PAH and its prognostic potential .,4
Fifty patients were studied .,3
"For the 11.25-mg and 15.0-mg groups , the median effective seated time ( 95 % confidence interval [ CI ] ) was 130 sec ( 95 % CI 117 to 150 ) and 385 sec ( 95 % CI 381 to 396 ) , respectively .",3
There exists a seated time after intrathecal injection of hyperbaric bupivacaine where 50 % of parturients do not experience hypotension .,4
This seated time increases with an increased dose of bupivacaine .,4
Further work is required to determine the full relationship between seated time and hypotension for other doses of anesthetic and to investigate the clinical utility of this technique for prevention of hypotension .,4
This trial was registered at www.clinicaltrials.gov ( NCT01561274 ) .,4
The primary outcome is the appearance of incisional hernias assessed by physical examination at clinical visits and radiologically ( CT scan ) performed at the end of follow-up .,3
"Secondary outcomes are the rate of complications , mainly infection , hematoma , burst abdomen , pain , and reoperation .",3
"The PREBIOUS trial has the potential to demonstrate that suture plus prosthetic mesh insertion for routine midline laparotomy closure is effective in preventing incisional hernias after open abdominal surgery , to avoid the effects on those affected , such as poor cosmesis , social embarrassment , or impaired quality of life , and to save costs potentially associated with incisional hernia surgical repair .",3
"Women randomized to the intervention group , compared with those randomized to the control group , were less likely to have invasive diagnostic testing ( 5.9 % vs 12.3 % ; odds ratio [ OR ] , 0.45 [ 95 % CI , 0.25-0 .80 ] ) and more likely to forgo testing altogether ( 25.6 % vs 20.4 % ; OR , 3.30 [ 95 % CI , 1.43-7 .64 ] , reference group screening followed by invasive testing ) .",3
"Women randomized to the intervention group also had higher knowledge scores ( 9.4 vs 8.6 on a 15-point scale ; mean group difference , 0.82 [ 95 % CI , 0.34-1 .31 ] ) and were more likely to correctly estimate the amniocentesis-related miscarriage risk ( 73.8 % vs 59.0 % ; OR , 1.95 [ 95 % CI , 1.39-2 .75 ] ) and their estimated age-adjusted chance of carrying a fetus with trisomy 21 ( 58.7 % vs 46.1 % ; OR , 1.66 [ 95 % CI , 1.22-2 .28 ] ) .",3
Significant differences did not emerge in decisional conflict or regret .,3
"Full implementation of prenatal testing guidelines using a computerized , interactive decision-support guide in the absence of financial barriers to testing resulted in less test use and more informed choices .",4
"If validated in additional populations , this approach may result in more informed and preference-based prenatal testing decision making and fewer women undergoing testing .",4
The participants were randomized to receive either dietetic treatment ( n = 72 ) or usual care ( n = 74 ) .,3
"After 6 months , no statistically significant differences were found between the dietetic treatment and usual care group in body weight change ( mean difference 0.78 kg , 95 % CI -0.26 -1.82 ) , QALYs ( mean difference 0.001 , 95 % CI -0.04 -0.04 ) and total costs ( mean difference 1645 , 95 % CI -525 -3547 ) .",3
The incremental cost-utility ratio ( ICUR ) for QALYs was not interpretable .,3
The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio ( ICER ) for body weight gain was 2111 .,3
The probability that dietetic treatment is cost-effective compared with usual care was 0.78 for a ceiling ratio of 5000 for body weight and 0.06 for a ceiling ratio of 20.000 for QALY .,3
"In this study , dietetic treatment in older , undernourished , community-dwelling individuals was not cost-effective compared with usual care .",4
"Over 18 months following training and TA , at least one participant from 13 ( 33 % ) Web-based assigned agencies and 19 ( 48 % ) traditional agencies reported program use .",3
"Longitudinal multilevel analysis found no differences between groups on any outcomes at the agency or participant level with one exception : Web-based agencies implemented the program with 35 % fewer couples compared with staff at manual-based agencies ( IRR 0.35 , CI , 0.13-0 .94 ) .",3
"Greater implementation of a Web-based program may require more resources and staff exposure , especially when paired with a couple-based modality .",4
"Manual-based and traditional programs may hold some advantage or ease for implementation , particularly at a time of low economic resources .",4
Data of 90 intervention and 74 control patients could be analysed .,3
Blood pressure in the intervention group decreased with 8.1 ( 95 % CI = 4.8 to 11.3 ) / 1.1 ( 95 % CI = -1.0 to 3.2 ) compared to -0.2 ( 95 % CI = -3.8 to 3.3 ) / -0.5 ( 95 % CI = -2.9 to 1.8 ) in the control group .,3
"Use of lipid-lowering drugs , angiotensin-system inhibitors and vitamin D was higher in the intervention group than in the control group ( 73 % versus 51 % , 81 % versus 64 % , and 15 % versus 1 % , respectively , [ P = 0.004 , P = 0.01 , and P = 0.002 ] ) .",3

"In the FPS group , the average actual wear rate for months 1 , 2 , and 3 were 91.7 % ( 15 patients ; 72.7 % to 97.0 % ) , 86.8 % ( 9 patients ; 60.5 % to 96.3 % ) , and 77.1 % ( 7 patients ; 52.6 % to 95.8 % ) , respectively .",3
"The average self-reported wear rate in the FPS group in months 1 , 2 , and 3 were 94.9 % ( 13 patients ; 93.1 % to 98.7 % ) , 95.6 % ( 10 patients ; 92.3 % to 99.4 % ) , and 94.8 % ( 11 patients ; 82.8 % to 99.6 % ) , respectively .",3
The most predictive factor in determining a patient 's decrease in the overall wear rate was a drop in the wear rate between months 1 and 2 ( P < 0.001 ) .,3
The reported wear rates were not statistically different between any of the 3 groups ( P < 0.01 ) .,3
"By using a novel method of pressure measurement , which documented FAO wear , we have shown a significant decline in wear rates from months 1 to 3 .",4
"These actual FAO wear rates did not match their reported rates , thus putting into question previous assumptions about reported brace compliance .",4
The largest drop in wear rates occurred from months 2 to 3 .,4
This study provides the first objective measurement of FAO brace wear in patients undergoing the Ponseti method of treatment .,4
"SG cases showed an average PHI of 64.3826.50 , whereas the average PHI in the CG was 47.88 % 27.84 .",3
Mean PI was 2.670.96 for SG and 2.750.86 for CG .,3
"A statistically significant difference was detected between the groups for PHI ( p = 0.0447 ) , whereas no difference was detectable for PI ( p = 0.77 ) .",3
"The use of a gel containing amino acids and sodium hyaluronate can promote faster healing via secondary intention in laser-induced wounds , although it does not seem to affect pain perception .",4
Training attendance was 86 % and the prescribed intensity of load was realised by the participants in the IG .,3
"Physical performance showed significant improvements in the IG in comparison to the CG : an increase of 24 % in the One-Repetition Maximum test in the chest press ( p < 0.05 ) , of 9-13 % in the modified Timed Up and Go test ( p < 0.05 ) , and of 10 % in the Maximal Step Length test ( p < 0.05 ) was identified .",3
"In conclusion , the FuMoC study was feasible in terms of compliance ( training attendance ) and the planned exercise regimen ( suitable exercises , intensity , and exertion ) and showed positive effects on physical performance .",4
"The rates of C/S were significantly different between Groups A and C , Groups A and D , and Groups B and D.",3
"The rates of instrumental delivery for normal spontaneous delivery were significantly different between Groups A and B , A and D , B and C , and C and D.",3
"The C/S rate was higher in Groups C and D ; however , the instrumental delivery rate was lower in Groups A and C.",4
We conclude that PCEA with 1mg/mL ropivacaine might provide the greatest benefit for labor analgesia .,4
"The cytokine antibody array revealed that interleukin-1 receptor antagonist ( Il-1ra ) and macrophage inflammatory protein ( MIP ) -1 a and MIP-1b were expressed at high levels in first-eye patients and were lower in second-eye patients , whereas opposite trends were found for monocyte chemoattractant protein 1 ( MCP-1 ) and for regulated on activation , normal T expressed and secreted ( RANTES ) ( all , P < 0.05 , Student 's t-test ) .",3
"However , only MCP-1 and IL-1ra were significantly different between the two groups after Bonferroni correction ( both P < 0.00125 ) .",3
"In the replication stage , the suspension cytokine array revealed that only MCP-1 expression was significantly greater in the aqueous humor of second-eye patients than in that of first-eye patients ( P = 0.0067 , Student 's t-test ) .",3
"This study revealed that expression of MCP-1 , a pain-related inflammatory chemokine , was significantly increased in aqueous humor in the contralateral eye after first-eye cataract surgery .",4
This suggests there may be a sympathetic ophthalmic type uveitis in the contralateral eye after first-eye cataract surgery and that may help to explain why second-eye phacoemulsification is often more painful .,4

HF F&V s increased plasma NO ( P = 0.0243 ) with +4 portions/d ( at 12 wk ) in the group as a whole .,3
"An increase in F&V s , regardless of flavonoid content in the groups as a whole , mitigated increases in vascular stiffness measured by PWA ( P = 0.0065 ) and reductions in NO ( P = 0.0299 ) in the control group .",3
"These data support recommendations to increase F&V intake to 6 portions daily , with additional benefit from F&V s that are rich in flavonoids , particularly in men with an increased risk of CVD .",4
"Both groups improved their knot tying performance ( P < .05 ) from pretest to the low anxiety conditions ( mean difference : QET , 28 % ; TT , 17 % ) ; however , only the QET group maintained their knot tying performance under the high-anxiety conditions ( mean difference : QET , 18 % ; P < .05 ) , with the TT group decreasing their performance close to pretest levels ( P > .05 ) .",3
The QET group also demonstrated more efficient gaze and hand movements post training .,3
"These data demonstrate the effectiveness of training gaze behaviors , not only to improve the effectiveness and efficiency of performance , but also to mediate negative effects of anxiety on performance .",4

"Recurrence occurred in 9 of 100 patients with a drain , and 26 of 100 patients in without drain group ( P = 0.002 ) .",3
The mortality was 5 % in patients with drain and 4 % in patients without drain group ( P = 0.744 ) .,3
The medical and surgical complications were comparable between the two study groups .,3
Use of a subdural drain after burr-hole evacuation of a CSDH reduces the recurrence rate and is not associated with increased complications .,4
No difference was found between treatment groups in self-reported days of MA use during the last 30 days of the active phase ( P = 0.22 ) .,3
"In planned secondary outcomes analyses , however , the MPH group had fewer self-reported MA use days from baseline through the active phase compared with the PLA group ( P = 0.05 ) .",3

Exposure to DHV-1 induced significant oxidative damage in ducklings .,3
"Administration of icariin or p-icariin attenuated liver pathological injury and significantly increased the survival rate , with better outcomes in ducklings treated with p-icariin than in those treated with icariin .",3
Icariin and p-icariin also attenuated the changes in oxidative stress and liver injury .,3
"We found positive correlations among indices of oxidative stress ( malondialdehyde and inducible nitric oxide synthase ) and liver injury ( alanine aminotransferase , alkaline phosphatase , and lactate dehydrogenase ) , suggesting that DHV-1 causes significant oxidative damage , which is related to the extent of hepatic injury .",3
Icariin and p-icariin improved the survival and attenuated oxidative stress and liver dysfunction induced by DHV-1 .,4
These outcomes were better in ducklings treated with p-icariin than in those treated by icariin .,4
The clinical effects of both components were related to their antioxidant activities .,4
Antipsychotics are currently the only available pharmacologic treatments for psychotic disorders .,4
"However , information about head-to-head differences in efficacy and tolerability of antipsychotics are scarce in children and adolescents .",4
The TEA trial aims at expanding the evidence base for the use of antipsychotics in early onset psychosis in order to inform more rational treatment decisions in this vulnerable population .,4
"Here , we account for the trial design , address methodological challenges , and discuss the estimation of sample size .",4
The benign/malignant ratio of MC was 66/41 .,3
"Of 11/107 discordant results , DBT classified MCs as R2 whereas FFDM classified them as R3 in 9 and R4 in 2 .",3
Three of these ( 3/107 = 2.8 % ) were malignant ; 8 ( 7.5 % ) were nonmalignant and were correctly classified as R2 on DBT but incorrectly classified as R3 on FFDM .,3
"Estimated sensitivity and specificity , respectively , were 100 % ( 95 % CI : 91 % to 100 % ) and 94.6 % ( 95 % CI : 86.7 % to 98.5 % ) for FFDM and 91.1 % ( 95 % CI : 78.8 % to 97.5 % ) and 100 % ( 95 % CI : 94.8 % to 100 % ) for DBT .",3
Overall intra - and interobserver agreements were 0.75 ( 95 % CI : 0.61-0 .84 ) and 0.73 ( 95 % CI : 0.62-0 .78 ) .,3
Most MCs are scored similarly on FFDM and DBT .,4
"Although a minority ( 11/107 ) of MCs are classified differently on FFDM ( benign MC classified as R3 ) and DBT ( malignant MC classified as R2 ) , this may have clinical relevance .",4
"The BI-RADS classification of MC differs for FFDM and DBT in 11/107 cases DBT assigned lower BI-RADS classes compared to FFDM in 11 clusters In 4/107 DBT may have missed some malignant and high-risk lesions In 7/107 the ` underclassification ' on DBT was correct , potentially avoiding unnecessary biopsies DBT may miss a small proportion of malignant lesions .",4
"The primary outcome was to evaluate changes in abdominal and shoulder-tip pain via a 100-mm visual analog scale at 1 , 3 , and 24hours postoperatively .",3
All procedures were completed via mini-laparoscopy without the need to increase intra-abdominal pressure or convert to conventional laparoscopy or open surgery .,3
"Intraoperatively , 1 episode of severe bradycardia occurred in the LPP group , whereas no intraoperative complications were recorded in the SPP group ( p = .47 ) .",3
No postoperative complications were recorded ( p > .99 ) .,3
Abdominal pain was similar between groups at each time point .,3
"Incidence and intensity of shoulder-tip pain at 1 and 3hours postoperatively was lower in the LPP group than in the SPP group ( p < .05 ) , whereas no between-group differences were observed at 24hours ( p > .05 ) .",3
"Rescue analgesic requirement did not differ statistically between the LPP and SPP groups ( 20 % vs 41 % , respectively ; p = .19 ; odds ratio , 2.7 ; 95 % confidence interval , 0.69-11 .08 ) .",3
"In experienced hands , use of LPP is safe and feasible .",4
"During performance of MLH , compared with SPP , LPP is asimple method that offers advantages of less shoulder-tip pain .",4
"After two courses of clinical treatment , the VAS score of arthralgia , joint function score and the duration of morning stiffness , joint tenderness , swelling were statistically significant differences as compared with before treatment ( all P < 0.01 ) , the efficacy in the acupuncture group was superior to that in the medication group ( all P < 0.01 ) .",3
"The cured-markedly effective rate and total effective rate were 61.9 % ( 26/42 ) and 95.2 % ( 40/42 ) in the acupuncture group , and 36.8 % ( 14/38 ) and 76.3 % ( 29/38 ) in the medication group respectively , with statistically significant differences between the two groups ( both P < 0.05 ) .",3
Shu-stream point acupuncture combined with fire needle therapy achieves a significant efficacy in the treatment of hand osteoarthritis .,4
"The study demonstrated the noninferiority of XPS to TURP for IPSS , Qmax , and complication-free proportion .",4
PV and PVR were comparable between groups .,4
"Time until stable health status , length of catheterisation , and length of hospital stay were superior with XPS ( p < 0.001 ) .",4
"Early reintervention rate within 30 d was three times higher after TURP ( p = 0.025 ) ; however , the overall postoperative reintervention rates were not significantly different between treatment arms .",4
A limitation was the short follow-up .,4
"XPS was shown to be noninferior ( comparable ) to TURP in terms of IPSS , Qmax , and proportion of patients free of complications .",4
XPS results in a lower rate of early reinterventions but has a similar rate after 6 mo. .,4
"Clopidogrel therapy resulted in a significant reduction in soluble CD40 ligand ( P = 0.03 ) , a prothrombotic and proinflammatory molecule derived mainly from activated platelets .",3
"However , clopidogrel therapy had no effect on endothelial function , arterial stiffness , inflammatory and oxidative stress markers , or progenitor cells .",3
"Our findings suggest a solitary antiplatelet effect of clopidogrel therapy in patients with stable coronary artery disease , with no effect on other subclinical markers of cardiovascular disease risk .",4
"At peak response , 93.2 % of the DDMM group and 98.4 % of the MMM group had binding antibodies for Env .",3
These binding antibodies were more frequent and of higher magnitude for the transmembrane subunit ( gp41 ) than the receptor-binding subunit ( gp120 ) of Env .,3
"For both regimens , response rates were higher for CD4 ( + ) T cells ( 66.4 % in the DDMM group and 43.1 % in the MMM group ) than for CD8 ( + ) T cells ( 21.8 % in the DDMM group and 14.9 % in the MMM group ) .",3
"Responding CD4 ( + ) and CD8 ( + ) T cells were biased toward Gag , and > 70 % produced 2 or 3 of the 4 cytokines evaluated ( ie , interferon , interleukin 2 , tumor necrosis factor , and granzyme B ) .",3
"Six months after vaccination , the magnitudes of antibodies and T-cell responses had decreased by < 3-fold .",3
DDMM and MMM vaccinations with virus-like particle-expressing immunogens elicited durable antibody and T-cell responses .,4
"Randomized and treated were 224 patients , 213 ( 95.1 % ) of whom completed the study .",3
"On day 28 , mean diurnal IOP was 20.1 , 20.0 , and 18.7 mmHg in the AR-13324 0.01 % , 0.02 % , and latanoprost groups , respectively , representing a decrease from unmedicated baseline of 5.5 , 5.7 , and 6.8 mmHg ( P < 0.001 ) .",3
The 5.7-mmHg reduction in IOP by AR-13324 0.02 % did not meet the criterion for noninferiority to latanoprost .,3
"The most frequently reported adverse event was conjunctival/ocular hyperemia , with a combined incidence of 52 % , 57 % , and 16 % , respectively .",3
"On day 28 at 08:00 hours , the incidence of mild to moderate hyperemia by biomicroscopy was 18 % , 24 % , and 11 % , respectively .",3
AR-13324 0.02 % was less effective than latanoprost by approximately 1 mmHg in patients with unmedicated IOPs of 22 to 35 mmHg .,4
"The major safety finding was ocular hyperemia , which was more common for both concentrations of AR-13324 than for latanoprost .",4
"HAM-A scores of Gamisoyo-San multi-compound extract group showed greater decrease compared to Gamisoyo-San individual extract mixture group and placebo group , but the difference was insignificant .",3
WHOQOL-BREF scores of Gamisoyo-San multi-compound extract group showed significant increase compared to Gamisoyo-San individual extract mixture group and placebo group .,3
"In Heart blood deficiency pattern , the Gamisoyo-San multi-compound extract group showed significant decrease in K-BDI compared to the Gamisoyo-San individual extract mixture group .",3
Gamisoyo-San did not improve anxiety level of GAD patients .,4
"However , it can be useful to improve quality of life , and reduce depressive , obsessive-compulsive , somatic symptoms of generalized anxiety disorder .",4
"Gamisoyo-San multi-compound seemed more effective than Gamisoyo-San individual extract mixture , especially in Heart blood deficiency pattern .",4
The recruitment and adherence goals of the study were met with a total of 60 subjects randomized ( n = 15 per group ) and most subjects attending at least 75 % of their scheduled visits .,3
No adverse events were reported by any of the subjects in the trial .,3
Our placebo treatment did not appear to be credible ; most subjects correctly guessed that they were receiving a placebo treatment .,3
"Between-group effect size estimates were small , indicating larger samples are needed for future studies .",3
This pilot study showed that it is feasible to recruit patients with LSS and that most subjects will adhere to a 6-week treatment schedule .,4
The information gained from this trial will be useful to inform the design of larger trials .,4
"Analysis of variance demonstrated no significant differences in chest compression depths between the Picture group ( M = 42 mm , 95 % CI = 40-45 ) and the Video group ( M = 39 mm , 95 % CI = 36-42 ) .",3
"In the Picture group significantly higher percentages of chest compressions with correct hand placement were achieved ( M = 67 % , CI = 58-77 ) compared to the Video group ( M = 53 % , CI = 43-63 ) , P = .03 , ( p ) ( 2 ) = .03 .",3
No other significant differences were found .,3
Results do not support the assumption that videos are superior to pictures for learning BLS and CPR in reciprocal learning .,4
"Mean SD segmentation time in the AS+R group was 19.7 8.0 min , compared to 28.5 8.0 min in the MS cohort , amounting to a 30.9 % time reduction ( Wilcoxon p < 0.01 ) .",3
"For each OAR , AS DSC was statistically different from both AS+R and MS ROIs ( all Steel-Dwass p < 0.01 ) except the spinal cord and the mandible , suggesting oversight of AS/MS processes is required ; AS+R and MS DSCs were non-different .",3
"AS compared to attending approved OAR DSCs varied considerably , with a chiasm mean SD DSC of 0.37 0.32 and brainstem of 0.97 0.03 .",3
Autosegmentation provides a time savings in head and neck regions of interest generation .,4
"However , attending physician approval remains vital .",4
"Independent of abdominal fat , weight stigma was significantly related to measures of cortisol ( including salivary measures of cortisol awakening response and serum morning levels ) as well as higher levels of oxidative stress .",3
Perceived stress mediated the relationship between weight stigma consciousness and the cortisol awakening response .,3
"These preliminary findings show that weight stigma is associated with greater biochemical stress , independent of level of adiposity .",4
It is possible that weight stigma may contribute to poor health underlying some forms of obesity .,4
Baseline platelet function measurements were similar in both groups .,3
"After 7 days , percent inhibitions of maximum platelet aggregation and late platelet aggregation were significantly greater in the triple versus dual group ( 42.3 % 16.0 % vs. 20.8 % 15.2 % , P < 0.01 , and 54.7 % 18.3 % vs. 21.5 % 29.2 % , P < 0.01 , respectively ) .",3
"During the 12-month follow-up , the rate of subsequent MACE ( 6/45 ) was significantly lower in the triple group compared with the dual group ( 14/45 ; P < 0.05 ) .",3
Adjunctive NXT to maintenance dose clopidogrel ( 75 g ) could enhance the antiplatelet effect and decrease subsequent MACE in patients with the CYP2C19 * 2 polymorphism undergoing PCI .,4
"During dexmedetomidine infusion , 5 % of Neonatal Pain , Agitation , Sedation Scale scores were > 3 , indicating agitation/pain , with 4 patients ( 10 % ) requiring more sedation and 17 ( 40 % ) requiring more analgesia .",3
"Though there was significant variability in pharmacokinetic variables , group I appeared to have lower weight-adjusted plasma clearance ( 0.3 vs 0.9 L h ( -1 ) kg ( -1 ) ) and increased elimination half-life ( 7.6 vs 3.2 hours ) compared with group II .",3
Fifty-six adverse events ( AEs ) were reported in 26 patients ( 62 % ) ; only 3 AEs ( 5 % ) were related to dexmedetomidine .,3
There were no serious AEs and no AEs or hemodynamic changes requiring dexmedetomidine discontinuation .,3
Dexmedetomidine is effective for sedating preterm and full-term neonates and is well-tolerated without significant AEs .,4
Preterm neonates had decreased plasma clearance and longer elimination half-life .,4
"During the 36-month follow-up , fewer participants in the experimental condition than in the comparison condition had incident chlamydial infections ( 94 vs 104 participants , respectively ; risk ratio = 0.50 ; 95 % CI , 0.28 to 0.88 ; P = .02 ) and gonococcal infections ( 48 vs 54 participants , respectively ; risk ratio = 0.40 ; 95 % CI , 0.15 to 1.02 ; P = .06 ) .",3
"Participants completing more telephone contacts had a lower risk of chlamydial infection ( risk ratio = 0.95 ; 95 % CI , 0.90 to 1.00 ; P = .05 ) .",3
"Participants in the experimental condition reported a higher proportion of condom-protected sexual acts in the 90 days ( mean difference = 0.08 ; 95 % CI , 0.06 to 0.11 ; P = .02 ) and 6 months ( mean difference = 0.08 ; 95 % CI , 0.06 to 0.10 ; P = .04 ) prior to assessments and fewer episodes of sexual acts while high on drugs and/or alcohol ( mean difference = -0.61 ; 95 % CI , -0.98 to -0.24 ; P < .001 ) .",3
"Sustaining the long-term impact of an STI/HIV intervention is achievable with brief , tailored telephone counseling .",4
A total of 345 caregivers from 53 adult ICU providers completed the SAPS II evaluation of one clinical scenario .,3
"The mean SAPS II scoring was 42.6 23.4 , with a bias of +5.74 ( 95 % CI 2.0-9 .5 ) compared to the reference score .",3
"There was no evidence of bias variation according to the case severity , ICU size , linguistic area , profession ( physician vs. nurse ) , experience , initial SAPS II training , or presence of a quality control system .",3
This nationwide survey revealed substantial variability in the SAPS II scoring results .,4
"On average , SAPS II scoring was overestimated by more than 13 % , irrespective of the profession or experience of the scorer or of the structural characteristics of the ICUs .",4
"The participants ' results were fairly homogenous , with most showing no difference in diagnosis using stereoscopic VR models .",3
One participant performed better on the monoscopic VR models .,3
"On average , monoscopic VRs achieved a slightly better diagnosis by 2.0 % .",3
"Stereoscopy has a long history , but it has only recently become technically feasible for stored cross-sectional data to be adequately reformatted and displayed in this format .",4
Scant literature exists to quantify the technology 's possible contribution to medical imaging - this study attempts to build on this limited knowledge base and promote discussion within the field .,4
Stereoscopic viewing of images should be further investigated and may well eventually find a permanent place in procedural and diagnostic medical imaging .,4
All vaccine formulations were highly immunogenic and met all 3 European licensure criteria after 2 doses .,3
"MF59-adjuvanted vaccines met all licensure criteria after 1 dose in both age cohorts , while nonadjuvanted vaccine did not meet all criteria after 1 dose in children 12-35 months .",3
"A single booster dose was highly immunogenic , and stable antibody persistence was observed in response to all vaccines .",3
All vaccines were well tolerated .,3
"In this study , a single dose of 3.75 g antigen with half the standard dose of MF59 was shown to be optimal , providing adequate levels of immediate and long-term antibodies in pediatric subjects 6-35 months of age .",4
"These data demonstrated that MF59 adjuvant allowed for reduced antigen content and promoted significant long-term antibody persistence in children , with a satisfactory safety profile .",4
"Significant improvement in both groups ( in-clinic group [ control ] and a home-based telerehabilitation group ) from the initial to the final assessment in the Berg Balance Scale ( p ( 2 ) = .68 ; P = .001 ) , in the balance ( p ( 2 ) = .24 ; P = .006 ) and gait ( p ( 2 ) = .57 , P = .001 ) subscales of the Tinetti Performance-Oriented Mobility Assessment , and in the Brunel Balance Assessment ( control : ( 2 ) = 15.0 ; P = .002 ; experimental : ( 2 ) = 21.9 ; P = .001 ) .",3
No significant differences were found between the groups in any balance scale or in the feedback questionnaires .,3
"With regard to subjective experiences , both groups considered the VR system similarly usable and motivating .",3
The in-clinic intervention resulted in more expenses than did the telerehabilitation intervention ( $ 654.72 per person ) .,3
"First , VR-based telerehabilitation interventions can promote the reacquisition of locomotor skills associated with balance in the same way as do in-clinic interventions , both complemented with a conventional therapy program ; second , the usability of and motivation to use the 2 interventions can be similar ; and third , telerehabilitation interventions can involve savings that vary depending on each scenario .",4
"Between Sept 3 , 2012 , and March 1 , 2013 , we enrolled 936 patients across six hospitals ( 403 patients in three hospitals with a restrictive policy and 533 patients in three hospitals with a liberal policy ) .",3
Recruitment rate was significantly higher for the liberal than for the restrictive policy ( 62 % vs 55 % ; p = 004 ) .,3
"Despite some baseline imbalances , Rockall and Blatchford risk scores were identical between policies .",3
Protocol adherence was 96 % ( SD 10 ) in the restrictive policy vs 83 % ( 25 ) in the liberal policy ( difference 14 % ; 95 % CI 7-21 ; p = 0005 ) .,3
Mean last recorded haemoglobin concentration was 116 ( SD 24 ) g/L for patients on the restrictive policy and 118 ( 20 ) g/L for those on the liberal policy ( difference -20 [ 95 % CI -120 to 70 ] ; p = 050 ) .,3
"Fewer patients received RBCs on the restrictive policy than on the liberal policy ( restrictive policy 133 [ 33 % ] vs liberal policy 247 [ 46 % ] ; difference -12 % [ 95 % CI -35 to 11 ] ; p = 023 ) , with fewer RBC units transfused ( mean 12 [ SD 21 ] vs 19 [ 28 ] ; difference -07 [ -16 to 03 ] ; p = 012 ) , although these differences were not significant .",3
We noted no significant difference in clinical outcomes .,3
"A cluster randomised design led to rapid recruitment , high protocol adherence , separation in degree of anaemia between groups , and non-significant reduction in RBC transfusion in the restrictive policy .",4
A large cluster randomised trial to assess the effectiveness of transfusion strategies for acute upper gastrointestinal bleeding is both feasible and essential before clinical practice guidelines change to recommend restrictive transfusion for all patients with acute upper gastrointestinal bleeding .,4
"Analysis of the 4-month intervention data indicated a significant improvement in the main outcomes of the study resulting from practice of the Transcendental Meditation program compared with controls ( Wilks [ 3,28 ] = 0.695 ; p = 0.019 ) .",3
"Results of univariate F tests indicated a significant reduction of all main outcome measures : perceived stress ( F [ 1,32 ] = 13.42 ; p = < 0.001 ) ; depression ( F [ 1,32 ] = 6.92 ; p = 0.013 ) ; and overall teacher burnout ( F [ 1,32 ] = 6.18 ; p = 0.018 ) .",3
Effect sizes ranged from 0.40 to 0.94 .,3
The Transcendental Meditation program was effective in reducing psychological distress in teachers and support staff working in a therapeutic school for students with behavioral problems .,4
These findings have important implications for employees job performance as well as their mental and physical health .,4
2 weeks after intervention the pain score decreased significantly from a median 5.5 in group A to 4 and did not change significantly in group B ( 5.3 to 5 ) .,3
"In group A both patients with positive and negative breath tests had a significant lower pain score ( -2 and -1.75 , respectively ) .",3
"Frequency of abdominal pain decreased in both groups but without significant difference , SSS improved only in group A from median 6 to 3.5 .",3
"Positive breath test was no predicting factor , neither was abdominal pain during the test .",3
Fructose restricted diet in children and adolescents with recurrent abdominal pain may be of benefit to improve both abdominal pain symptoms and other secondary symptoms .,4
"Since a negative breath test result does not exclude a positive response to fructose restriction , the hydrogen breath test does not seem to be the appropriate diagnostic mean to predict the response to the diet .",4
"Severity of drug use ( p < .01 ) , gender ( p < .001 ) , and age ( p < .001 ) were significant main effect predictors of number of unprotected sexual occasions ( USOs ) at follow-up in the non-zero portion of the ZINB model ( men , younger participants , and those with greater severity of drug/alcohol abuse have more USOs ) .",3
Monogamous relationship status ( p < .001 ) and race/ethnicity ( p < .001 ) were significant predictors of having at least one USO vs. none ( monogamous individuals and African Americans were more likely to have at least one USO ) .,3
"Significant moderators of intervention effectiveness included recent sex under the influence of drugs/alcohol ( p < .01 in non-zero portion of model ) , duration of abuse of primary drug ( p < .05 in non-zero portion of model ) , and Hispanic ethnicity ( p < .01 in the zero portion , p < .05 in the non-zero portion of model ) .",3
These predictor and moderator findings point to ways in which patients may be selected for the different HIV sexual risk reduction interventions and suggest potential avenues for further development of the interventions for increasing their effectiveness within certain subgroups .,4
Meal energy intake was significantly lower in the normal-weight ( 804.5438.9 vs 892.6330.2 kcal ; P = 0.04 ) but not the overweight/obese ( 667.3304.1 vs 724.8355.5 kcal ; P = 0.18 ) subjects during the slow vs the fast eating condition .,3
"Both groups had lower meal energy density ( P = 0.005 and P = 0.001 , respectively ) and eating rate ( P < 0.0001 in both groups ) during the slow vs the fast eating condition .",3
"Both groups reported less hunger ( P = 0.01 and P = 0.03 , respectively ) , and the normal-weight subjects reported more fullness ( P = 0.02 ) at 60 minutes after the meal began during the slow compared with the fast eating condition .",3
There was no eating speed by weight status interaction for any of the variables .,3
Eating slowly significantly lowered meal energy intake in the normal-weight but not in the overweight/obese group .,4
It lowered eating rate and energy density in both groups .,4
Eating slowly led to lower hunger ratings in both groups and increased fullness ratings in the normal-weight group at 60 minutes from when the meal began .,4
"Of 120 subjects enrolled , 116 ( 96.7 % ) completed the trial .",3
"Preintervention optimal adherence was similar in intervention vs. control arms ( 63.5 % vs. 58.9 % , respectively ; P = 0.60 ) .",3
"In the last intervention month , 87.3 % vs. 51.8 % achieved optimal adherence [ risk ratio ( RR ) : 1.7 , 95 % confidence interval ( CI ) : 1.3 to 2.2 ] and mean adherence was 96.2 % vs. 89.1 % ( P = 0.003 ) .",3
"Among preintervention suboptimal adherers , 78.3 % vs. 33.3 % ( RR : 2.4 , CI : 1.2 to 4.5 ) achieved optimal adherence and mean adherence was 93.3 % vs. 84.7 % ( P = 0.039 ) .",3
"Proportions were 92.5 % and 62.9 % among optimal adherers , respectively ( RR : 1.5 , CI : 1.1 to 1.9 ) and mean adherence was 97.8 % vs. 91.7 % ( P = 0.028 ) .",3
Postintervention clinical outcomes were not significant .,3
Real-time reminders significantly improved ART adherence in this population .,4
This approach seems promising for managing HIV and other chronic diseases and warrants further investigation and adaptation in other settings .,4
Sweat samples collected in hot conditions produced higher sweat sodium concentrations than those from the temperate environment ( P = .0032 ) .,3
A significant difference ( P = .0048 ) in estimates of sweat sodium concentration was evident when calculated from the forearm average ( mean 95 % CL ; 64 12 mmol/L ) compared with using a 4-site equation ( 70 12 mmol/L ) .,3
"There was a high correlation between the values produced using different analytical techniques ( r2 = .95 ) , but mean values were different between treatments ( frozen FP , frozen SC > immediate ISE > frozen ISE ; P < .0001 ) .",3
Whole-body sweat sodium concentration estimates differed depending on the number of sites included in the calculation .,4
Environmental testing conditions should be considered in the interpretation of results .,4
The impact of sample freezing and subsequent analytical technique was small but statistically significant .,4
"Nevertheless , when undertaken using a standardized protocol , the regional absorbent-patch method appears to be a relatively robust field test .",4
"Of this mostly middle-age , married , non-Hispanic white sample , 66 % had primary brain tumors , 27 % had brain metastases , and 8 % underwent prophylactic cranial irradiation .",3
"After 24 weeks of treatment , the composite scores did not differ significantly between groups ( P = .48 ) ; however , significant differences favoring donepezil were observed for memory ( recognition , P = .027 ; discrimination , P = .007 ) and motor speed and dexterity ( P = .016 ) .",3
"Significant interactions between pretreatment cognitive function and treatment were found for cognitive composite ( P = .01 ) , immediate recall ( P = .05 ) , delayed recall ( P = .004 ) , attention ( P = .01 ) , visuomotor skills ( P = .02 ) , and motor speed and dexterity ( P < .001 ) , with the benefits of donepezil greater for those who were more cognitively impaired before study treatment .",3
"Treatment with donepezil did not significantly improve the overall composite score , but it did result in modest improvements in several cognitive functions , especially among patients with greater pretreatment impairments .",4
"No statistically significant differences in VAS , need for analgesics , nor in secondary outcomes were observed , except for substantially reduced flexion at 6 weeks in the advanced cryotherapy group ( 114 versus 120 ) .",3
Advanced cryotherapy with a continuous temperature for a prolonged period does not deliver expected results of superior early recovery after knee arthroplasty .,4
Greater sample sizes are required to fully determine significant differences between the two techniques for these study parameters .,4
Immobilization of the knee in extension during the prolonged cryotherapy session resulted in lower active flexion at 6 weeks after surgery for the advanced cryotherapy group .,4
Advanced cryotherapy should not be used in fast track knee arthroplasty if the economic cost is higher than the price of cold packs or offers no other concomitant advantages .,4
"A Friedman 's test showed that there was a significant improvement in the drilling performance of the feedback group , ( 2 ) ( 1 ) = 14.450 , P < .001 .",3
The postexperiment assessment demonstrated that the system provided timely feedback ( when trainee behavior was detected ) 88.6 % of the time and appropriate feedback ( accurate advice ) 84.2 % of the time .,3
Participants ' opinions about the usefulness of the system were highly positive .,3
"The automated feedback system was observed to be effective in improving surgical technique , and the provided feedback was found to be accurate and useful .",4
"After stretching , the SR athletes shifted the mean CoP towards the toes ( 1 cm ; p < 0.01 ) while the WR athletes shifted the CoP towards the heels ( 1 cm ; p < 0.01 ) during AS .",3
"For the remaining exercises , the SR athletes shifted the CoP towards the heels ( between 0.8 cm and 5.7 cm ) compared to WR ( 1.9 cm towards the heels in FS , no significant change in OHS ( 1 mm ) and DL ( 3 mm ) ) .",3
The controls did not show any change between pre - and post-datasets .,3
"After stretching , the CV decreased for the AS and OHS exercises ( AS : 10.2 % to 7.0 % , OHS 9.8 % to 7.8 % ) , but increased after WR ( AS : 7.1 % to 10.1 % ) or did not change significantly ( OHS ) .",3
Both WR and SR resulted in increased CV values for FS and DL .,3
No change of CV was observed in the controls .,3
SR had a stronger impact on CoP during the assessed exercises than either WR or controls .,4
"A reduction in CV after SR exercises ( AS , OHS ) suggests a clear improvement in stability and balance during weight-lifting .",4
The lack of a significant effect for complex movements ( OHS ) suggests only a limited effect of a 10-minute warm-up routine on CoP features .,4
10 minutes stretching might therefore be more efficient for improving stability than a general 10 minute warm-up .,4
The results of the study will provide valuable information for both health care professionals and policy makers .,4
If this study shows the RM to be both effective and cost-effective the protocol can be implemented on a large scale .,4

"Overall survival did not differ significantly between groups ( stratified hazard ratio for death , 0.88 ; 95 % CI , 0.76 to 1.02 ; P = 0.10 ) .",3
The respective overall survival rates with bevacizumab and placebo were 72.4 % and 66.3 % at 1 year ( P = 0.049 ) and 33.9 % and 30.1 % at 2 years ( P = 0.24 ) .,3
"Baseline health-related quality of life and performance status were maintained longer in the bevacizumab group , and the glucocorticoid requirement was lower .",3
More patients in the bevacizumab group than in the placebo group had grade 3 or higher adverse events ( 66.8 % vs. 51.3 % ) and grade 3 or higher adverse events often associated with bevacizumab ( 32.5 % vs. 15.8 % ) .,3
The addition of bevacizumab to radiotherapy-temozolomide did not improve survival in patients with glioblastoma .,4
"Improved progression-free survival and maintenance of baseline quality of life and performance status were observed with bevacizumab ; however , the rate of adverse events was higher with bevacizumab than with placebo .",4

"In addition , changes in BAP and LS vBMD ( trab ) were positively correlated ( R = 0.281 , P = .027 ) .",3
No consistent changes were detected in bone density at the hip .,3
"Our data suggest that high-dose RSV supplementation positively affects bone , primarily by stimulating formation or mineralization .",4
Future studies of longer duration comprising populations at risk of osteoporosis are needed to confirm these results .,4
"FTS was associated with shorter time to bowel function return [ ( 67.819.7 ) h vs. ( 90.020.6 ) h , P < 0.01 ] , shorter hospital stay [ ( 13.53.0 ) d vs. ( 17.87.3 ) d , P = 0.01 ] , lower hospital cost [ ( 23.83.7 ) thousand Yuan vs. ( 27.86.1 ) thousand Yuan , P < 0.05 ] , and less stress response ( lower pain score , WBC count , C-reactive protein , all P < 0.01 ) .",3

Quadriceps activation significantly decreased during the effusion session .,3
AMT and MEP change scores were not different between effusion and control conditions .,3
No substantial differences were found in slope between any percentages of AMT .,3
An experimental knee effusion did not induce changes in corticomotor excitability .,4
Further research is needed to understand how corticomotor pathways are affected following joint injury .,4
Corticomotor excitability alterations may not be the cause of acute changes in neuromuscular activation following joint effusion .,4
Future research should determine whether clinically altering corticomotor excitability will improve physical function .,4
"After 24 h , hematoma volume and hematoma enlargement in the experimental group was significantly lower than control ( p < 0.05 ) .",3
"After 14 days , NIHSS score in the experimental group was significantly lower than control ( p < 0.05 ) .",3
Cerebral edema amount and serum MMP-9 level in the experimental group were significantly lower than control after 5 days and 14 days .,3
"Ultra-early basal ganglia intracerebral hemorrhage can remarkably reduce hematoma enlargement , cerebral edema , serum MMP-9 level , and improve the neurological function .",4
Exposure to grass pollen induced a significant worsening of AD .,3
A pronounced eczema flare-up of air-exposed rather than covered skin areas occurred .,3
"In grass pollen-exposed subjects a significantly higher increase in CCL17 , CCL22 , and IL-4 serum levels was observed .",3
This study demonstrates that controlled exposure to airborne allergens of patients with a so-called extrinsic IgE-mediated form of AD induced a worsening of cutaneous symptoms .,4
Significant improvement in recognition and working memory performance was observed in the group that consumed NSP compared with placebo or sucrose .,3
Improvements in memory performance following NSP intake were independent of changes in blood glucose .,3
This is the first report of acute behavioural improvement following plant polysaccharide intake in healthy middle-aged adults under conditions of mental fatigue .,4
The findings suggest that certain NSP may enhance memory performance through mechanisms other than elevated blood glucose .,4
Twenty one ( 42 % ) of children in intervention group were cured completely and 2 ( 4 % ) children in control group had complete recovery ( p < 0.001 ) .,3
Symptom severity score was 22.98 2.95 before treatment that reduced to 13.26 3.20 after treatment ( p < 0.001 ) .,3
Use of fluticasone can reduce the severity of symptoms of sinusitis in children .,4

One participant was lost to follow-up in each group before week 4 .,3
Weight loss was significantly ( P < 0.001 ) larger in the SmartLoss ( least squares meanSEM : -9.40.5 % ) compared with the Health Education group ( -0.60.5 % ) .,3
SmartLoss efficaciously promote clinically meaningful weight loss compared with an attention-matched control group .,4
Smartphone-based interventions might prove useful in intervention dissemination .,4
"Before and after treatment , there were no significant differences in Ashworth and GMFM scores between groups A1 and A2 ( P > 0.05 ) .",3
"After treatment , group B1 had a significantly reduced Ashworth score and a significantly increased GMFM score , and group B1 had a significantly lower Ashworth score and a significantly higher GMFM score compared with group B2 ( P < 0.05 ) .",3
"For groups A and B , Ashworth score gradually declined post-treatment , reached the lowest point at 3 months after treatment , and returned to the level before treatment at 12 months after treatment ; GMFM score gradually increased post-treatment and reached the peak level at 12 months after treatment ( P < 0.05 ) .",3
The level of muscle tension should be considered when BTX-A injection is used for treating tiptoe deformation in children with cerebral palsy .,4
"It makes no difference to use high - or low-dose BTX-A when the muscle tension level is within I-II , but high-dose BTX-A has a better performance in reducing muscle tension and improving motor function when the muscle tension level is within III-IV .",4
"One month after dose 3 , serum anti-gE antibody concentrations and frequencies of gE-specific CD4 ( + ) T cells were higher following HZ/su vaccination than after receipt of saline ( P < .0001 ) .",3
Median cell-mediated immune responses peaked after dose 2 .,3
Humoral and cell-mediated immune responses persisted until the end of the study ( month 18 ) .,3
No vaccination-related serious adverse events were reported .,3
No sustained impact on HIV load or CD4 ( + ) T-cell count was noted following vaccinations .,3
HZ/su was immunogenic and had a clinically acceptable safety profile in HIV-infected adults .,4
"Endophthalmitis developed after 11 of 18 509 injections ( 1 per 1700 [ 0.06 % ] ; 95 % confidence interval , 0.03 % -0.11 % ) , and in 11 of 1185 patients ( 0.93 % ; 95 % confidence interval , 0.52-1 .66 ) .",3
"Incidence of endophthalmitis was 0.15 % among injections with no antibiotic use , 0.08 % among injections with preinjection antibiotics only , 0.06 % among injections with postinjection antibiotics only , and 0.04 % among injections with preinjection and postinjection antibiotics ( P = 0.20 ) .",3
All eyes were treated with intravitreal antibiotics and 4 underwent vitrectomy .,3
"Among the 11 affected eyes , the final study visual acuity was 20/40 or better in 4 eyes ( 36 % ) , 20/50 to 20/80 in 2 eyes ( 18 % ) , 20/100 to 20/160 in 3 eyes ( 27 % ) , and worse than 20/800 in 2 eyes ( 18 % ) .",3
The final visual acuity was within 2 lines of the visual acuity before endophthalmitis in 5 eyes ( 45 % ) .,3
Rates of endophthalmitis were low and similar to those in other large-scale studies .,4
Use of topical antibiotics either before or after injection does not seem to reduce the risk for endophthalmitis .,4
"The demographic characteristics , age , body mass index , BIS score , and weight were not significantly different between the atracurium ( ATRA ) priming group and control groups .",3
"The binomial regression model showed that BMI was an independent predictor variable for myoclonus ( OR : 2.1 , CI 95 % : 1.7-7 .5 , p = 0.032 ) .",3
"In this model , adjusted odds ratios ( OR ) of myoclonus ( multivariate logistic regression analysis ) in the control group was 6.6 ( 95 % CI : 1.5-9 .7 , p = 0.013 ) .",3
Low-dose atracurium priming could effectively suppress etomidate-induced myoclonus .,4
"Mixed views were expressed by front-line professionals , which seem to reflect their levels of engagement .",3
It was broadly welcomed by nursing staff as long as it supplemented rather than substituted their role in traditional patient care .,3
GPs held mixed views ; some gave a cautious welcome but most saw telehealth as increasing their work burden and potentially undermining their professional autonomy .,3
Health care professionals will need to develop a shared understanding of patient self-management through telehealth .,4
This may require a renegotiation of their roles and responsibilities .,4
VITAH will determine whether an intensive vitamin D supplementation regimen will improve cardiac autonomic tone compared to conventional vitamin D supplementation and will assess the safety of these two supplementation regimens in ESKD patients receiving chronic hemodialysis .,4
Baseline PRO scores were similar between the two arms of the study .,3
"Throughout and after treatment , patients receiving 12 or 24 weeks had similar FACIT-F , CLDQ-HCV , SF-36 and WPAI : SHP scores ( all p > 0.05 ) .",3
"Compared to their own baseline scores , patients receiving SOF+RBV experienced modest declines in some aspects of SF-36 , CLDQ-HCV , fatigue and WPAI : SHP scores ( p = 0.04 to < 0.0001 ) .",3
"By follow-up week 12 , all PRO scores returned to the pre-treatment levels ( p > 0.05 ) .",3
"In patients achieving SVR-12 ( regardless of the regimen ) , significant improvements were noted in general health ( p = 0.0004 ) , CLDQ-HCV ( p < 0.0001 ) , fatigue ( p = 0.005 ) , emotional well-being ( p < 0.0001 ) and physical component summary score of SF-36 ( p = 0.0022 ) .",3
"In multivariate analysis , baseline depression , fatigue , insomnia , cirrhosis , and treatment-related adverse events were the most consistent predictors of PRO impairment ( all p < 0.05 ) .",3
PROs are minimally impacted by SOF+RBV regimens .,4
An additional 12 weeks of treatment does not substantially add to the PRO burden .,4
"In client-centred therapy , more sessions were used for diagnostic consultation ( 10.9 % points difference , p = 0.030 ) ; the time needed to formulate the first treatment goal was longer ( 11.4 days difference , p = 0.041 ) ; there was a tendency towards more goals directed to diagnostic issues ( 0.69 goals difference , p = 0.056 ) , spending more hours on indirect issues ( 1.16 h difference , p = 0.051 ) and towards a longer total therapy period ( 1.56 months difference , p = 0.058 ) than in usual care .",3
Client-centred therapy resulted in more intensive diagnostic evaluation and less intensive treatment .,4
This suggests that client-centred therapy should be adjusted towards a more proportional distribution of time devoted to diagnostic evaluation versus actual treatment .,4
"At M1 , the median FEV1 increased by 260 ml in the budesonide/formoterol arm compared with 5 ml in the placebo arm ( P = 0.012 ) .",3
"The median increases in the FEV1 at M1 relative to the baseline value for the treated and placebo groups were 13 and 0 % , respectively ( P = 0.019 ) .",3
Twenty-five patients received budesonide/formoterol during the study .,3
The median difference in the FEV1 between the baseline and after 1 month of treatment for these patients was +240 ml ( P = 0.0001 ) .,3
The effect of budesonide/formoterol on the FEV1 was maintained in the 13 patients who completed 6 months of treatment .,3
Budesonide/formoterol administration led to a significant improvement in the FEV1 in patients with mild/severe BOS after allogeneic HSCT .,4

All incisions healed at the first stage ; no deep vein thrombosis of lower limbs or pulmonary embolism occurred .,3
"Knee infection occurred in 3 cases ( 1 in the periosteal dissector group and 2 in the electric scalpel group ) , and the 3 patients received stage 2 total knee revision using antibiotic bone cement and TC3 prosthesis .",3
No recurrence of infection occurred during follow-up .,3
"Among the 20 patients who had anterior knee pain , 16 patients were in the periosteal dissector group and 4 patients were in the electric scalpel group .",3
The occurrence rate of anterior knee pain in the electric scalpel group was lower than that in the periosteal dissector group .,3
"The AKS knee score and HSS score after total knee arthroplasty in the electric scalpel group were all higher than those in the periosteal dissector group , and the VAS in electric scalpel group was lower than that of periosteal dossector group .",3
"Compared with using electric scalpel , using periosteal dissector used to release medial collateral ligament and pes anserinus may cause more anterior knee pain after total knee arthroplasty .",4
No group differences were noted in baseline salivary cortisol levels : 0.36 g/dL ( SD 0.25 ) in the co-bedding group and 0.43 g/dL ( SD 0.50 ) in the standard care group .,3
"Twenty minutes after lance , levels were significantly lower in the co-bedding group , 0.28 g/dL ( SD 0.25 ) versus 0.50 g/dL ( SD 0.73 ) in the standard group ( P = 0.04 ) .",3
"Similarly , the mean of paired changes in salivary cortisol from baseline was lower in the co-bedding group ( -0.06 g/dL ) compared with the standard care group ( 0.14 g/dL , P < 0.05 ) .",3
Co-bedding attenuates the stress response of preterm twins undergoing heel lance .,4
"We showed that dietary protein significantly modified genetic effects on changes in food cravings and appetite scores at 6 mo after adjustment for age , sex , ethnicity , baseline body mass index , weight change , and baseline value for respective outcomes ( P-interaction = 0.027 and 0.048 , respectively ) .",3
"The A allele was associated with a greater decrease in food cravings and appetite scores in participants with high-protein-diet intake ( P = 0.027 and 0.047 , respectively ) but not in subjects in the low-protein-diet group ( P = 0.384 and 0.078 , respectively ) .",3
The weight regain from 6 to 24 mo attenuated gene-protein interactions .,3
Protein intakes did not modify FTO genotype effects on other appetite measures .,3
Our data suggest that individuals with the FTO rs9939609 A allele might obtain more benefits in a reduction of food cravings and appetite by choosing a hypocaloric and higher-protein weight-loss diet .,4
This trial was registered at clinicaltrials.gov as NCT00072995 .,4
1300 individuals with minor TT were recruited and randomly assigned to quality trichiasis surgery or repeated epilation using high quality epilation forceps by a trained person with good near vision .,3
"Participants were examined six-monthly for two-years , and then at four-years after randomisation .",3
At two-years all epilation arm participants were offered free surgery .,3
"At four-years 1151 ( 88.5 % ) were re-examined : 572 ( 88 % ) and 579 ( 89 % ) from epilation and surgery arms , respectively .",3
"At that time , 21.1 % of the surgery arm participants had recurrent TT ; 189/572 ( 33 % ) of the epilation arm had received surgery , while 383 ( 67 % ) declined surgery and had continued epilating ( `` epilation-only '' ) .",3
"Among the epilation-only group , 207 ( 54.1 % ) fully controlled their TT , 166 ( 43.3 % ) had minor TT and 10 ( 2.6 % ) had major TT ( > 5 lashes ) .",3
"There were no differences between participants in the epilation-only , epilation-to-surgery and surgery arm participants in changes in visual acuity and corneal opacity between baseline and four-years .",3
Most minor TT participants randomised to the epilation arm continued epilating and controlled their TT .,4
Change in vision and corneal opacity was comparable between surgery and epilation-only participants .,4
This suggests that good quality epilation with regular follow-up is a reasonable second-line alternative to surgery for minor TT for individuals who either decline surgery or do not have immediate access to surgical treatment .,4
High-dose and low-dose groups were combined as a single dexmedetomidine group for primary analysis with secondary analysis exploring a dose-response relationship .,3
"The difference in 24-hour lorazepam requirements after versus before study drug was greater in the dexmedetomidine group compared with the placebo group ( -56 mg vs -8 mg , p = 0.037 ) .",3
Median differences were similar for high dose and low dose .,3
The 7-day cumulative lorazepam requirements were not statistically different between dexmedetomidine and placebo ( 159 mg vs 181 mg ) .,3
"Clinical Institute Withdrawal Assessment or Riker sedation-agitation scale scores representing severe agitation ( 13 % vs 25 % ) or moderate agitation ( 27 % vs 22 % ) within 24 hours of initiating study drug were similar for dexmedetomidine and placebo groups , respectively .",3
"Bradycardia occurred more frequently in the dexmedetomidine group versus placebo group ( 25 % vs 0 % , p = not significant ) , with the majority of bradycardia occurring in the high-dose group ( 37.5 % ) .",3
"Study drug rate adjustments occurred more often in the dexmedetomidine group compared with the placebo group ( 50 % vs 0 % , p = 0.02 ) .",3
Neither endotracheal intubation nor seizure occurred in any group while on study drug .,3
"Adjunctive dexmedetomidine for severe alcohol withdrawal maintains symptom control and reduces lorazepam exposure in the short term , but not long term , when using a symptom-triggered protocol .",4
Monitoring for bradycardia is needed with dexmedetomidine but the occurrence may be lessened with low dose .,4
Further study is needed to evaluate the clinical impact of dexmedetomidine .,4
No significant differences were detected between groups on PAS or residue in the 4 boluses .,3
"Pain scores , however , were significantly lower in the anesthetized condition than the decongested-only condition ( P = .035 ) .",3
The findings of this study indicated that 0.2 mL of 4 % lidocaine enhanced exam tolerability and did not impair the swallow in dysphagic patients .,4
"A two-arm , parallel RCT was conducted in overweight or obese children ( n = 322 ; aged 10-14 years ) to determine the effect of active video games on body composition .",3
"Statistically significant overall treatment effects favouring the intervention group were found for body mass index , body mass index z-score and percentage body fat at 24 weeks .",3
"For these outcomes , pre-specified subgroup analyses were conducted among important baseline demographic ( ethnicity , sex ) and prognostic ( cardiovascular fitness ) groups .",3
"No statistically significant interaction effects were found between the treatment and subgroup terms in the main regression model ( p = 0.36 to 0.93 ) , indicating a consistent treatment effect across these groups .",3
Preliminary evidence suggests an active video games intervention had a consistent positive effect on body composition among important subgroups .,4
This may support the use of these games as a pragmatic public health intervention to displace sedentary behaviour with physical activity in young people .,4
Thirty-one participants completed all three treatment periods .,3
Both oxycodone and APAP were rapidly absorbed under fasted conditions .,3
"Total oxycodone and APAP exposures ( area under the plasma drug concentration-time curve [ AUC ] ) from ER OC/APAP were not significantly affected by food , and minimal changes to maximum observed plasma concentration for oxycodone and APAP were also noted .",3
"However , food marginally delayed the time to maximum observed plasma concentration of oxycodone and APAP .",3
There was no indication that tolerability was affected by food .,3
The findings from this study suggest that ER OC/APAP can be administered with or without food .,4
Results of the trial will provide evidence of the effectiveness of the nutrition education package in community settings of rural Tanzania .,4
They will provide recommendations for strengthening the nutrition component of health education in child health services .,4
"AUC H2 ( mean standard error of the mean ) was higher for raw vs pasteurized on day 1 ( 113 21 vs 71 12 ppmmin10 ( -2 ) , respectively , P = .01 ) but not day 8 ( 72 14 vs 74 15 ppmmin10 ( -2 ) , respectively , P = .9 ) .",3
Symptom severities were not different for raw vs pasteurized on day 7 with the highest dosage ( P > .7 ) .,3
AUC H2 and symptom severities were higher for both dairy milks compared with soy milk .,3
Raw milk failed to reduce lactose malabsorption or lactose intolerance symptoms compared with pasteurized milk among adults positive for lactose malabsorption .,4
These results do not support widespread anecdotal claims that raw milk reduces the symptoms of lactose intolerance .,4
"Men , more frequently than women , exhibited increased hypoxic chemosensitivity and displayed nocturnal periodic breathing at altitude .",3
"Acetazolamide leftward shifted the CO2 set point and , at altitude , improved oxygenation and reduced periodic breathing in both sexes , but to a larger extent in men .",3
Hypoxic chemosensitivity directly correlated with the number of apneas/hypopneas at altitude in the placebo group but not in the acetazolamide group .,3
The greater severity of periodic breathing during sleep displayed by men at altitude could be attributed to their increased hypoxic chemosensitivity .,4
"Acetazolamide counteracted the occurrence of periodic breathing at altitude in both sexes , modifying the apneic threshold and improving oxygenation .",4
No patient had catheter-related infection in the intervention group ( an estimated 12776 manipulations ) ; the control group had 2 infection episodes in 5230 catheter-days ( an estimated 13 075 manipulations ) .,3
"The incidence of bacterial colonization was not significantly higher in the needleless group than in the syringe group ( 22.2 % vs 12.2 % ; relative risk , 0.55 ; 95 % CI , 0.16-1 .71 ) , with 1778 ( SD , 114 ) and 1918 ( SD , 82 ) catheter manipulations , respectively .",3
Arterial catheter complications were negligible in all patients .,3
Glycemia was detected from arterial catheter samples as effectively as with laboratory results ( venous samples ) except when hematocrit was less than 25 % .,3
"Use of blood obtained via an arterial catheter is safe and effective for glucose monitoring in patients undergoing intensive insulin therapy , with no increase in complications of catheterization .",4
Schirmer 1 scores increased after caffeine intake .,3
The increase was statistically significant at 45 and 90 minutes ( p < 0.05 ) after caffeine intake .,3
"Age , body mass , and blood pressure had no correlation with Schirmer 1 scores ( Spearman correlation test , p > 0.05 ) .",3
"There was no influence of gender in caffeine 's effect on tear secretion ( F = 0.994 , p = 0.399 ) .",3
"From our study , orally ingested caffeine appears to stimulate tear secretion in healthy non-dry eye subjects .",4
"There were no statistically significant differences between the two groups in baseline characteristics , clinical and laboratory index , severity of acute cholangitis , bacteria isolated from blood cultures , and clinical outcomes .",3
"The rate of eradication of bacteria was 93.1 % in group A and 93.3 % in group B , respectively ( p = 0.97 ) .",3
"Using non-inferiority tests , the rate of eradication of bacteria in group A was not inferior to that in group B ( 95 % CI -0.13 to 0.14 , p = 0.97 ) .",3
There was no statistically significant difference in the recurrence of acute cholangitis and a 30-day mortality rate between the two groups .,3
Early switch to oral antibiotic therapy following adequate biliary drainage for treatment of acute cholangitis with bacteremia was not inferior to conventional 10-day intravenous antibiotic therapy .,4
"Overall , 219 patients underwent randomization ( 105 in the GM-PCR group and 114 in the GM group ) .",3
"The cumulative incidence of `` proven '' or `` probable '' IA ( primary study outcome ) was lower in the GM-PCR group ( 4.2 % vs 13.1 % ; odds ratio , 0.29 [ 95 % confidence interval , .09 -.91 ] ) .",3
"The median interval from the start of monitoring to the diagnosis of IA was lower in the GM-PCR group ( 13 vs 20 days ; P = .022 ) , as well as the use of empirical antifungal therapy ( 16.7 % vs 29.0 % ; P = .038 ) .",3
Patients in the GM-PCR group had higher proven or probable IA-free survival ( P = .027 ) .,3
A combined monitoring strategy based on serum GM and Aspergillus DNA was associated with an earlier diagnosis and a lower incidence of IA in high-risk hematological patients .,4

"A total of 77 patients were enrolled , with 42 patients in group A , and 35 patients in group B. Baseline characteristics , biochemical indexes and operational characteristics were well balanced between two groups .",3
The time-insulin sensitivity curves of the two groups indicated that IR was present early ( day 1 to day 7 ) in gastric cancer patients and was significantly different between patients who had undergone surgical treatment and those who had not .,3
"Insulin sensitivity ( SI ) of patients in group B were higher than patients in group A with adjusting BMI , age and SI preoperative at 72 h , 120 h and 168 h post-surgery .",3
The management of EEN can alleviate insulin resistance in gastric cancer patients with surgical treatment .,4
"There was a tendency of fewer patients being dead or dependent in acupuncture group ( 80/385 , 20.7 % ) than in control group ( 102/396 , 25.8 % ) at 6 months ( odds ratio , 0.75 ; 95 % confidence interval , 0.54-1 .05 ) .",3
"The benefit was noted in subgroup receiving 10 sessions of acupuncture ( odds ratio , 0.68 ; 95 % confidence interval , 0.47-0 .98 ) .",3
"There was no statistical difference in death or institutional care between the 2 groups ( odds ratio , 1.06 ; 95 % confidence interval , 0.63-1 .79 ) .",3
"Severe adverse events occurred in 7.6 % and 8.3 % of patients in the 2 groups , respectively .",3
Acupuncture seemed to be safe in the subacute phase of ischemic stroke .,4
"If the potential benefits observed are confirmed in future larger study , the health gain from wider use of the treatment could be substantial .",4
"EP2006 and originator filgrastim ( US and EU approved ) were highly similar with respect to primary , secondary , and tertiary protein structures ; mass , size , purity , charge , and hydrophobicity .",3
"No differences in receptor binding affinity were observed , and all samples demonstrated similar in vitro bioactivity .",3
"In the phase I study , no statistically significant differences between EP2006 and US-approved originator filgrastim were noted in pharmacodynamic or pharmacokinetic parameters , and all confidence intervals were within the equivalence boundaries .",3
The two products had similar safety profiles .,3
These studies provide robust evidence of the structural and functional similarity between the proposed biosimilar filgrastim ( EP2006 ) and the US-approved originator filgrastim .,4
"Both the ERN and ERN-L groups showed significant declines in serum phosphorus , calcium and calciumphosphorus product at 24 weeks compared to placebo .",3
"A significant decline from baseline ( 10.9 % , p < 0.01 ) in the serum FGF23 concentration was observed in the ERN group compared to placebo , but not in the ERN-L group compared to placebo ( p = 0.36 and 0.97 for ERN-L and placebo , respectively ) , despite equivalent declines in serum phosphorus .",3
"Similarly , the most marked declines in PTH occurred in the ERN-only group versus placebo ; no change in PTH was observed in the ERN-L group .",3
"In this ancillary study of hyperlipidemic patients with an eGFR of 30-74 ml/min/1 .73 m ( 2 ) , ERN alone but not in combination with laropiprant lowered FGF23 and PTH concentrations .",4
"If confirmed , niacin may provide a novel strategy to decrease phosphorus , FGF23 , and PTH concentrations in patients with chronic kidney disease .",4
"Compared with the control group and with pre-treatment in the same group , MMSE , clinical dementia rating , and activities of daily living scale scores in the intervention group were significantly improved ( all P < 0.05 ) .",3
These metrics mildly improved in the control group compared with before treatment ( P > 0.05 ) .,3

We found that combined TCM therapy is effective and safe for managing mild to moderate AD .,4
"The CBT had no effect on headache and pressure pain thresholds and only a minor impact on the CPTH patients ' quality of life , psychological distress , and the overall experience of symptoms .",3
"The waiting-list group experienced no change in headache but , opposed to the treatment group , a significant decrease in somatic and cognitive symptoms indicating a spontaneous remission over time .",3
Our primarily negative findings confirm that management of patients with CPTH still remains a considerable challenge .,4
Psychological group therapy with CBT might be effective in an earlier stage of CPTH and in less severely affected patients but our findings strongly underline the need for randomized controlled studies to test the efficacy of psychological therapy .,4
"There was no significant increase in anxiety score within any group between baseline and OR transport ( P = 0.21 , 0.42 , and 0.57 for midazolam , video glasses , and combined groups , respectively ) .",3
"An increase in anxiety , though not large enough to be clinically significant , was observed from baseline to induction in the midazolam and combined groups ( P = 0.02 and 0.03 ) but not in the video glasses group ( P = 0.38 ) .",3
Confidence intervals for pairwise comparisons in Modified Yale Preoperative Anxiety Scale changes among groups were all within a clinically significant difference of 15 units .,3
The use of video glasses and midazolam alone or in combination maintains baseline levels of anxiety at time of transport to the OR and prevents significantly increased anxiety during induction of anesthesia in children .,4
"Video glasses are not inferior to midazolam for preoperative anxiolysis and provide a safe , noninvasive , nonpharmacologic , and pleasant alternative .",4
"Among water-scarce schools , comprehensive WASH improvements were associated with decreased odds of diarrhea ( odds ratio [ OR ] = 0.44 ; 95 % confidence interval [ CI ] = 0.27 , 0.73 ) and visiting a clinic ( OR = 0.36 ; 95 % CI = 0.19 , 0.68 ) , relative to control schools .",3
"In our separate study group of schools with greater water availability , school hygiene promotion and water treatment interventions and school sanitation improvements were not associated with differences in diarrhea prevalence between intervention and control schools .",3
"In water-scarce areas , school WASH interventions that include robust water supply improvements can reduce diarrheal diseases among young children .",4
There were no clinical findings related to fluralaner treatment .,3
Statistically significant differences between the treated groups and the control group were observed for some clinical pathology parameters and organ weights ; none of these findings were considered to be of clinical relevance .,3
Oral administration of fluralaner at the highest recommended treatment dose ( 56 mg/kg ) at 8-week intervals is well tolerated and has a safety margin of more than five in healthy dogs eight weeks of age or older and weighing at least 2 kg .,4
"Findings of the study revealed a significant effect ( ANCOVA test ) of moderate intensity continuous exercise training program on , SBP , DBP , VO max and CD4 cell count at P < 0.05 .",3
Changes in VO max significantly correlated ( Pearson correlation test ) with changes in CD4 cell count ( r = 0.528 ) at P < 0.05 .,3

"General satisfaction , satisfaction with chewing , and satisfaction with speaking were significantly higher in the ARLD than in the CARD group ( P = .049 , .025 , and .049 , respectively ) .",3
The chewing satisfaction with maxillary dentures in the ARLD group was significantly higher than that of the CARD group ( P = .02 ) .,3
No significant difference existed between the MI of the ARLD ( 69.2 17.0 ) and CARD groups ( 66.7 18.7 ) .,3
"Within its limitations , this study showed that the ARL improves a complete denture wearer 's satisfaction ratings .",4
"The dorsal group included a total of 161 patients ( mean age : 62.3 13.04 years ) , while the lateral group included 160 patients ( mean age : 62.7 14.4 years ) .",3
The proportion of patients with a complete digital rectal examination was 44 % ( n = 71 ) in the dorsal group and 49 % ( n = 79 ) in the lateral group ( p = 0.3 ) .,3
The entire circumference of the rectum could be examined in 66 % of the patients ( n = 106 ) in the dorsal group and in 79.5 % of the patients ( n = 128 ) in the lateral group ( p = 0.007 ) .,3
The intergroup difference in terms of digital rectal examination completion rate was not significant .,4
"In the lateral position , however , the entire circumference of the rectum could be examined more thoroughly .",4
"The `` mild '' stimulation led to significantly shorter follicular phase , lower consumption of exogenous Gn and lower peak estradiol level than the `` long '' regimen .",3
"With the `` long '' protocol , significantly less cycles were cancelled due to the lack of ovarian response ; further , it obtained significantly more oocytes , more mature oocytes , more embryos , and a thicker endometrium .",3
"As for the final IVF outcome , however , the two stimulation regimens obtained comparable implantation rate , clinical pregnancy rate , and ongoing pregnancy rate at 12 weeks .",3
"In conclusion , the `` mild '' CC/Gn/GnRH-ant stimulation protocol is a valid alternative to the long protocol with high Gn dose as it obtains a comparable success rate and requires significantly less medications , with an obvious economical advantage .",4
The oximeter masking algorithm was associated with an increase in both stability and instability of displayed saturations that occurred during the transition between offset and true displayed values at opposite ends of the 2 target ranges .,3
Caregivers maintained saturations at lower displayed values in the higher than in the lower target group .,3
This differential management reduced the separation between the median true saturations in the 2groups by approximately 3.5 % .,3
The design of the oximeter masking algorithm may have contributed to the smaller-than-expected separation between true saturations in the 2 study groups of recent saturation targeting trials in extremely preterm infants .,4

"Participants assigned to cigarettes with 5.2 mg per gram smoked an average of 20.8 cigarettes per day , which did not differ significantly from the average number among those who smoked control cigarettes .",3
"Cigarettes with lower nicotine content , as compared with control cigarettes , reduced exposure to and dependence on nicotine , as well as craving during abstinence from smoking , without significantly increasing the expired carbon monoxide level or total puff volume , suggesting minimal compensation .",3
Adverse events were generally mild and similar among groups .,3
"In this 6-week study , reduced-nicotine cigarettes versus standard-nicotine cigarettes reduced nicotine exposure and dependence and the number of cigarettes smoked .",4

A total of 56 children were recruited from 156 eligible children ( 1 October 2010 to 16 June 2012 ) .,3
"Recruitment , randomization and both interventions were feasible and acceptable .",3
Participants suggested changes to improve feasibility and acceptability and we incorporated the following in the trial protocol : stopped collecting 6-week outcomes ; introduced a second reminder letter ; used phone calls to collect primary outcomes from nonresponders ; informed participants about different approaches of each intervention and changed our recommendation for the primary outcome for the full study from school attendance to disability ( SF-36 physical function subscale ) and fatigue ( Chalder Fatigue Scale ) .,3
Conducting randomized controlled trials ( RCTs ) to investigate an alternative treatment such as LP is feasible and acceptable for children with CFS or ME .,4
Feasibility studies that incorporate qualitative methodology enable changes to be made to trial protocols to improve acceptability to participants .,4
This is likely to improve recruitment rate and trial retention .,4
The systemic exposure in children in comparison to adolescents was equivalent for formoterol while it was halved for beclometasone-17-monopropionate in accordance with the halved dose of beclometasone administered in children ( 90 % CIs within 0.8-1 .25 for formoterol and 0.4-0 .625 for beclometasone-17-monopropionate ) .,3
The systemic exposure to beclometasone-17-monopropionate and formoterol was equivalent between adolescents and adults .,3
The systemic exposure to the active ingredients of a fixed dose combination of beclometasone/formoterol administered via pMDI with AeroChamber Plus correlates with the nominal dose independently of patient age and body size .,4
"Thus , dose reduction in relation to age when using a pMDI with VHC may be unnecessary for reducing the systemic exposure in children .",4
Post-tonsillectomy pain on 6 selected days and overall pain during the 10-day follow-up period were significantly lower in Group 1 .,3
"However , return to normal diet and incidence of postoperative bleeding did not differ significantly between the groups .",3
Intraoperative application of cold water after tonsillectomy significantly reduced postoperative pain .,4
We recommend cooling the tonsillar fossa and pharyngeal mucosa with cold water during tonsillectomy to easily and effectively reduce post-tonsillectomy pain .,4
We enrolled 575 subjects ( 276 RB and 299 no RB ) ; 92 % were men with a mean age of 61.6 years and high school level reading ability .,3
"The groups were comparable in their perceptions regarding time to make a decision ( RB 88 % Strongly Agree ( SA ) , no RB 88 % SA ; P = 0.61 ) , satisfaction with consent ( RB 90 % SA , no RB 87 % SA ; P = 0.27 ) , ease of understanding ( RB 69 % SA , no RB 67 % SA ; P = 0.73 ) receipt of the right amount of information regarding the indications ( RB 85 % SA , no RB 87 % ; P = 0.61 ) , the benefits ( RB 87 % SA , no RB 86 % SA ; P = 0.29 ) , and the risks ( RB 87 % SA , no RB 84 % SA ; P = 0.19 ) of surgery .",3
More of the RB group felt they received the right amount of information about alternatives to surgery ( RB 80 % SA ) than did the no RB group ( 69 % SA ) ; P = 0.01 .,3
Patients were highly satisfied with RB during surgical IC RB is not detrimental to the consent process and may improve informed consent for surgery .,4
Substantial and significant differences in performance were found .,3
"The sheath was rated as ` good ' for extended use ( e.g. golf and travel ) when pad changing is difficult ; for keeping skin dry , not leaking , not smelling and convenient for storage and travel .",3
The BWU was generally rated worse than the sheath and was mainly used for similar activities but by men who could not use a sheath ( e.g. retracted penis ) and was not good for seated activities .,3
"The clamp was good for short vigorous activities like swimming/exercise ; it was the most secure , least likely to leak , most discreet but almost all men described it as uncomfortable or painful .",3
"The pads were good for everyday activities and best for night-time use ; most easy to use , comfortable when dry but most likely to leak and most uncomfortable when wet .",3
There was a preference for having a mixture of products to meet daytime needs ; around two-thirds of men were using a combination of pads and devices after testing compared with baseline .,3
This is the first trial to systematically compare different continence management devices for men .,4
"Pads and devices have different strengths , which make them particularly suited to certain circumstances and activities .",4
Most men prefer to use pads at night but would choose a mixture of pads and devices during the day .,4
Device limitations were important but may be overcome by better design .,4

"Both dermabrasion and electrobrasion improved scars , but there was no significant difference between the outcomes of the two procedures on several measures .",4
Procedure time and bleeding time were significantly lower for electrobrasion .,4
Omega-3 supplement lowered BDI score significantly after 4 months of intervention .,3
"Among pro- and anti-inflammatory mediators , only serum ferritin level and IL-10 to IL-6 ratio showed significant changes in favor of omega-3 supplement during the study .",3
"In linear regression model adjusted for baseline values , omega-3 treatment was a significant predictor of reduced serum CRP , ferritin , and iPTH levels , and increased IL-10 to IL-6 ratio .",3
No significant association was found between the anti-inflammatory and anti-depressant effects of omega-3 supplement .,3
Supplemental use of omega-3 fatty acids decreases depressive symptoms in hemodialysis patients apart from their anti-inflammatory effects .,4
This will be the first study to examine the repeated use of KMC for managing procedural pain in preterm neonates .,4
"It is also the first to compare KMC to sucrose , or the interventions in combination , across time .",4
"Based on the theoretical framework of the brain opioid theory of attachment , it is expected that KMC will be a preferred standard of care .",4
"However , current pain management guidelines are based on minimal data on repeated use of either intervention .",4
"Therefore , regardless of the outcomes of this study , results will have important implications for guidelines and practices related to management of procedural pain in preterm infants .",4
"At baseline , 36 % of children were overweight or obese and 11 % achieved the recommended 13,500 steps per day .",3

We judged that informed consent would undermine the scientific validity of the study and present harms that are out of proportion to the very low risk intervention .,3
Our study demonstrates the feasibility of designing an ethical randomized controlled trial of an early electronic alert for acute kidney injury without obtaining informed consent from individual participants .,4
"Our study outcome may serve as a model for other studies of acute kidney injury , insofar as our paradigm accounts for the effect that early death and dialysis have on assessment of acute kidney injury severity as defined by maximum achieved serum creatinine .",4
The mean follow-up time was 22.8 months 7.7 ( standard deviation ) in the TIPS group and 20.9 months 8.9 in the EBL group .,3
The 2-year probability of remaining free of recurrent variceal bleeding was higher in the TIPS group ( 77.8 % ) than in the EBL group ( 42.9 % ) ( P = .002 ) .,3
Overall recanalization was achieved in 24 ( 64.9 % ) patients from the TIPS group and seven ( 19.4 % ) patients from the EBL group .,3

"In addition , only two additional ureteral stenting for pyelonephritis and one renal subcapsular hematoma were observed .",3
This study suggests that the efficiency of SWL with the frequency of 30 or 45 shots per minute is similar to that of 60 or 80 shots for stone reduction and clearance .,4
"Plasma BNP and left ventricular ejection fraction were improved with both treatments ( furosemide : p = 0.02 and p = 0.009 , respectively , spironolactone : p = 0.03 and p = 0.007 , respectively ) .",3
"Fasting plasma glucose was not changed ; however , plasma insulin levels decreased and insulin sensitivity ( by homeostasis model assessment : HOMA-IR ) improved with spironolactone as compared to furosemide ( p < 0.0005 ) .",3
"TNF - , IL-6 and MCP-1 decreased with spironolactone ( p = 0.002 , p = 0.02 and p = 0.02 vs. baseline , respectively ) , but not with furosemide .",3

"Analysis using a 10,000-iteration bootstrap approach showed that the mean difference in postoperative ileus related costs ( p = 0.04 ) but not total combined costs ( p = 0.068 ) was significantly lower for alvimopan than for placebo .",3
In patients treated with radical cystectomy alvimopan decreased hospitalization cost by reducing the health care services associated with postoperative ileus and decreasing the hospital stay .,4
Polypharmacy persisted in both groups .,3
"At discharge , a higher rate of A drugs was prescribed in the intervention group ( 58 patients , median age 84 years ) vs. standard care ( 56 patients , median age 83 years , p < 0.02 ) , and both over - and under-prescriptions were significantly lower in the FORTA than in the control group ( p < 0.03 ) .",3
"Two ( 3.4 % ) intervention , but 12 ( 21.4 % ) control , patients fell at least once ( p < 0.001 ) .",3
"The fall rate per 1,000 patient years was 1.58.3 in the intervention and 10.625.4 in the control group ( p < 0.004 ) .",3
This pilot study shows that the application of the FORTA list is feasible in geriatric patients .,4
"In this small study , the medication quality improved in the intervention group , but polypharmacy persisted in both groups .",4
The fall rate was significantly lower in the intervention group .,4
These encouraging results must be interpreted carefully .,4
"At 10 years there was significantly less wear of HXLPE ( 0.003 mm/year ; 95 % confidence interval [ CI ] , 0.010 ; SD 0.023 ; range , -0.057 to 0.074 ) compared with UHMWPE ( 0.030 mm/year ; 95 % CI , 0.012 ; p < 0.001 ; SD 0.0.27 ; range , -0.001 to 0.164 ) .",3
"The volumetric penetration from 1 to 10 years for the UHMWPE group was 98 mm3 ( 95 % CI , 46 mm3 ; SD 102 mm3 ; range , -4 to 430 mm3 ) compared with 14 mm3 ( 95 % CI , 40 mm3 ; SD 91 mm3 ; range , -189 to 242 mm3 ) for the HXLPE group ( p = 0.01 ) .",3
This study demonstrates that HXLPE has little detectable steady-state in vivo wear .,4

"Of the 3081 participants with impaired glucose metabolism at baseline , 655 ( 21 % ) progressed to diabetes over a median 2.8 years ' follow-up .",3
The diabetes risk model had good discrimination ( C statistic = 0.73 ) and calibration .,3
"Although the lifestyle intervention provided a sixfold greater absolute risk reduction in the highest risk quarter than in the lowest risk quarter , patients in the lowest risk quarter still received substantial benefit ( three year absolute risk reduction 4.9 % v 28.3 % in highest risk quarter ; numbers needed to treat of 20.4 and 3.5 , respectively ) .",3
"The benefit of metformin , however , was seen almost entirely in patients in the top quarter of risk of diabetes .",3
No benefit was seen in the lowest risk quarter .,3
Participants in the highest risk quarter averaged a 21.4 % three year absolute risk reduction ( number needed to treat 4.6 ) .,3
Patients at high risk of diabetes have substantial variation in their likelihood of receiving benefit from diabetes prevention treatments .,4
"Using this knowledge could decrease overtreatment and make prevention of diabetes far more efficient , effective , and patient centered , provided that decision making is based on an accurate risk prediction tool .",4

The majority of the participants achieved an average of 83 % of the target of 10 000 steps per day for 10 weeks .,3
There was a significant increase in daily physical activity ( p = 0.016 ) in the intervention group .,3
"Significant differences were also found for some breast cancer-specific symptoms [ swelling , mobility and pain ( p = 0.045 ) ] .",3
The study showed a relatively small weight gain an average of 0.9 kg in the intervention group and 1.3 kg in the control group .,3
Physical activity in the form of walking is feasible during adjuvant chemotherapy treatment despite increasing symptoms .,4
The physical activity increased in the intervention group during the study time and had a positive impact on breast symptoms and the weight gain was lower in comparison to previous studies .,4
"Although the alcohol did not deteriorate the performance of working memory task , it caused in the EEG a decrease of relative theta power and lower right fronto-parietal correlation in theta and alpha2 bands .",3
"Only women who drank alcohol in the follicular phase had a higher relative potency of alpha1 , which could indicate a lower level of arousal and attention .",3
These results contribute to a better understanding of the brain mechanisms underlying cognitive changes with alcohol and its relationship to the menstrual cycle .,4
"A total of 140 pregnant women with GDM were included in the study , including 66 in the low-GI staple diet group and 74 in the normal diabetic diet control group .",3
No differences existed in baseline characteristics between the 2 groups ( all P > 0.05 ) .,3
"After dietary intervention , glucose levels were significantly reduced in the low-GI staple diet group ( all P < 0.01 ) and the control group ( all P < 0.008 ) .",3
"Postintervention glucose values after breakfast , lunch , and dinner were significantly reduced in the treatment group compared with those in the control group ( all P < 0.05 ) .",3
The percentage changes from baseline of all glucose values were significantly greater in the treatment group than in the control group ( all P < 0.05 ) .,3

We applied generalized linear models to examine the relative impact of a 1-unit increase in SHFM scores on counts of medical resource use and direct medical costs at 1 year of follow-up .,3
"Of 2331 randomized patients , 2288 ( 98 % ) had a rounded integer SHFM score between -1 and 2 , consistent with predicted 1-year survival of 98 % and 74 % , respectively .",3
"At baseline , median age was 59 years , 28 % of patients were women , and nearly two-thirds of the cohort had New York Heart Association class II heart failure and one-third had class III heart failure .",3
"Higher SHFM scores were associated with more hospitalizations ( rate ratio per 1-unit increase , 1.86 ; P < .001 ) , more inpatient days ( 2.30 ; P < .001 ) , and higher inpatient costs ( 2.28 ; P < .001 ) , outpatient costs ( 1.54 ; P < .001 ) , and total medical costs ( 2.13 ; P < .001 ) .",3
"Although developed to predict all-cause mortality , SHFM scores also predict medical resource use and costs .",4
The Opt-IN trial is the first study to use the MOST framework to develop a weight loss treatment that will be optimized to yield the best weight loss outcome attainable for $ 500 or less .,4
The mean difference in central corneal thickness at baseline and 1 week between Group 1 and Group 2 was statistically significant ( P = 0.027 ) .,3
"However , this difference at baseline when compared to 6 week and 1 week , 6 weeks was not statistically significant ( P > 0.05 ) .",3
The difference in mean endothelial cell density between groups at 1 week and 6 weeks was statistically significant ( P = 0.016 ) .,3
"The mean coefficient of variation and mean standard deviation between groups were not statistically significant ( P > 0.05 , both comparisons ) .",3
"The central corneal thickness , coefficient of variation , and standard deviation were maintained in both groups indicating that the function and morphology of endothelial cells was not affected despite an initial reduction in endothelial cell number in MSICS .",4

This study was part of a randomized clinical trial titled Rural Education to Improve Outcomes in Heart Failure ( REMOTE-HF ) designed to test an education and counseling intervention to improve self-care in patients with HF .,3
We evaluated 612 rural patients .,3
Multiple validated questionnaires were administered to assess patient perceptions of health and health literacy .,3
Baseline factors were collected and compared with baseline QoL measures only .,3
Patients ' health-related QoL was assessed using the Minnesota Living with Heart Failure scale .,3
The data were analyzed using a general linear model to test the association of various patient characteristics with QoL in rural patients with HF .,3
Patients were 65.8 ( +12.9 ) years of age .,3
"The majority were men ( 58.7 % ) , married ( 56.4 % ) , and had completed a high-school education ( 80.9 % ) .",3
"Factors associated with reduced QoL among this population include geographic location , younger age , male sex , higher New York Heart Association class , worse HF knowledge , poorer perceived control , and symptoms of depression or anxiety .",3
The data provided no evidence of an association between left ventricular ejection fraction and QoL .,3
This study of rural patients with HF confirms previously identified factors associated with perceptions of QoL .,4

"Two patients in G1 and eight in G2 undergoing clean operations had some type of infection ( p = 0.1789 ) , five in G1 and three in G2 undergoing potentially contaminated operations had some type of infection ( p = 0.7205 ) .",3
The incidence of surgical site infection in operations classified as clean and as potentially contaminated for which skin preparation was done with 10 % povidone-iodine and 0.5 % chlorhexidine-alcohol was similar .,4
The median age of the patients was 34.5 ( 16-75 ) years .,3
The baseline clinical and MRI findings were similar between the two groups .,3
"At 6 months , 13 out of 60 ( 21.7 % ) patients in the levofloxacin arm and 23 out of 60 ( 38.3 % ) patients in the rifampicin arm had died ( P = 0.07 ) .",3
"On Cox regression analysis , survival in the levofloxacin group was significantly better than in the rifampicin group ( hazard ratio 2.13 , 95 % CI 1.04-4 .34 , P = 0.04 ) .",3
"The functional outcome ( P = 0.47 ) was , however , not significantly different between the two groups .",3
"On intention-to-treat analysis , 10 out of 47 ( 21.3 % ) in the levofloxacin arm and 5 out of 37 ( 13.5 % ) in the rifampicin arm had poor recovery .",3
Repeat MRI findings did not differ between the groups .,3
"Levofloxacin was discontinued more frequently than rifampicin due to SAEs ( 16 versus 4 , P = 0.01 ) .",3
Levofloxacin is superior to rifampicin in reducing 6 month death in TBM but not disability .,4
Levofloxacin may be used in TBM especially in those patients with hepatotoxicity and without seizure .,4
Twenty-five subjects ( median age = 5.25 years ; range = 9 months-9 .9 years ) were studied ; 12 subjects received cisatracurium and 13 subjects received rocuronium .,3
"Data are shown as mean proportional change SD or , in the case of not normally distributed , median proportional change ( first , third quartile ) with P values .",3
"In the cisatracurium group , there were no differences between baseline and postneuromuscular blocker administration in the fractional change from the baselines of FVC ( 1.00 0.04 , P = 0.5 ) , but there was a significant decrease in MEF10 ( 0.80 0.18 , P = 0.002 ) .",3
"In the rocuronium group , there were small yet significant decreases of FVC ( 0.99 [ first quartile 0.97 , third quartile 1 ] , P = 0.02 ) and significant decreases in MEF10 ( 0.78 0.26 , P = 0.008 ) .",3
"After administration of albuterol in the cisatracurium group , FVC increased slightly but significantly from baseline values ( 1.02 0.02 , P = 0.005 ) .",3
"MEF10 increased significantly beyond baseline values ( 1.24 0.43 , P = 0.04 ) .",3
"In the rocuronium group , there were also significant differences between baseline and postalbuterol administration from the baseline value of FVC ( 1.02 0.02 , P = 0.004 ) and MEF10 ( 1.23 0.29 , P = 0.01 ) .",3
"At clinically relevant doses , both cisatracurium and rocuronium caused changes in lung function , indicating constriction of smaller airways .",4
"In general , these changes were mild and not clinically detectable .",4
"However , in the rocuronium group , 3 of 13 patients showed more noticeable decreases in MEF10 ( 50 % ) , demonstrating the potential for significant broncho-bronchiolar constriction in susceptible patients .",4
"A median of 4 maintenance cycles was administered ( range , pemetrexed 1-44 ; mean SD 7.9 8.3 ; placebo 1-38 ; mean SD 5.0 5.2 ) , with 28 % of pemetrexed and 12 % of placebo patients receiving 10 maintenance cycles .",3
The pemetrexed dose intensity was 94 % .,3
More patients receiving pemetrexed ( 12 % ) than placebo discontinued because of possible drug-related CTCAEs ( 4 % ; P = .005 ) .,3
"Overall , pemetrexed was associated with significantly more ( P < .05 ) low-grade events ( grade 1/2 nausea , grade 2 anemia , edema , and neutropenia ) than placebo .",3
"Overall , the incidence of low-grade fatigue , anemia , and neutropenia decreased with long-term pemetrexed exposure ; however , renal events increased across treatment arms .",3
EQ-5D analyses demonstrated no treatment-by-time interaction or overall treatment differences between the 2 arms .,3
PARAMOUNT demonstrated a low incidence of low-grade toxicities with long-term pemetrexed exposure without compromising QoL in patients with NS-NSCLC .,4
The study was successfully completed both in group A and B. Mean arterial pressure ( MAP ) in group B was lower than group A during the examination significantly ( P < 0.05 ) .,3
"The time falling to sleep in two groups were ( 13.4 + / - 2.5 ) min and ( 6.6 + / - 1.2 ) min , and the time in group A was much longer than that in group B.",3
"The lowest oxygen saturation during the examination in two groups were 0.835 + / - 0.096 and 0.691 + / - 0.095 , and the difference was statistically significant .",3
There was no incidence of adverse reactions in two groups .,3
"Compared with propofol , Dexmedetomidine is a safer sleep-inducing drug , and it can be used for clinical sleep endoscopy .",4
The full-intervention group showed increases in observed tool possession ( P = 0.014 ) and expression of their preferences and values ( P = 0.043 ) .,3
The simulation exposure-only group showed improvement in worksheet scores ( P = 0.002 ) and fewer engagement skills ( P = 0.021 ) .,3
Both groups showed a decrease in telling an SC about their hospital admission ( P < 0.05 ) .,3
Open-ended comments from the program evaluation were largely positive .,3
Both groups benefited from exposure to the SC intervention .,4
Program evaluation data suggest that simulation training is feasible and may provide a useful methodology for teaching patient skills for active engagement in health care .,4
Future studies are warranted to determine if this methodology can be used to assess overall patient engagement and whether new patient learning transfers to health care encounters .,4
"Alirocumab concentration-time profiles were similar , and free PCSK9 levels were reduced to approximately zero between Day 3 and Day 4 postinjection in all groups .",3
"LDL-C levels reached nadir on Day 15 postinjection in all groups with mean percentage reductions of 48.4 % ( abdomen ) , 39.5 % ( upper arm ) , and 45.6 % ( thigh ) at this time point .",3
A similar effect on LDL-C levels was seen across the entire time course of the study at all three injection sites .,3
"Treatment-emergent adverse events were experienced by 8/20 ( abdomen ) , 11/20 ( upper arm ) , and 13/20 ( thigh ) subjects .",3
There were 2 mild/transient injection site reactions .,3
There were no serious adverse events .,3
"A single subcutaneous administration of alirocumab 75 mg via prefilled pen was well tolerated with similar pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics when injected into the abdomen , upper arm , or thigh .",4
"These results suggest that alirocumab can be interchangeably injected in the abdomen , upper arm , or thigh .",4
"Adult , overweight participants with type 2 diabetes , with albuminuria ( 30-600 mg/24 h or an albumin-to-creatinine ratio of 3.0-60 mg/mmol ) , and estimated GFR of > 40 ml/min/1 .73 m ( 2 ) were enrolled .",3
Participants were randomized to an HPD or an SPD .,3
Protein : fat : carbohydrate ratio was 30:30:40 % of energy for the HPD and 20:30:50 % for the SPD .,3
"Main outcomes were renal function , weight loss , blood pressure , serum lipids and glycaemic control .",3
We recruited 76 volunteers and 45 ( 35 men and 10 women ) finished .,3
There were no overall changes in renal function at 12 months and no significant differences in weight loss between groups ( 9.7 2.9 kg and 6.6 1.4 kg HPD and SPD group respectively ; p = 0.32 ) .,3
Fasting blood glucose decreased significantly with no treatment effect .,3
The decrease in HbA1c differed between treatments at 6 months ( HPD -0.9 vs. SPD -0.3 % ; p = 0.039 ) but not at 12 months .,3
HDL increased significantly with no treatment effects .,3
There were no changes in LDL or blood pressure overall but DBP was lower in the HPD group ( p = 0.024 ) at 12 months .,3
Weight loss improved overall metabolic control in this group of well controlled participants with type 2 diabetes regardless of diet composition .,4
The duration and intensity of serous wound discharge differed significantly between the two groups .,3
Duration of wound discharge after drain removal was 2.2 ( 2.7 ) days in the dabigatran group and 1.2 ( 1.9 ) days in the enoxaparin group ( p < 0.05 ) .,3
Significant increase in serous discharge was found in the dabigatran group ( p < 0.05 ) on third and seventh postoperative days compared to the enoxaparin group .,3
Both thromboprophylactic agents were found to have appropriate antithrombotic effects after THR .,4
"However , dabigatran was associated with an increased incidence of prolonged serous wound discharge , which might cause longer hospitalization and might instigate the use of prolonged antibiotic prophylaxis .",4
The treatment success was significantly higher in synbiotic group ( 82.6 % ) compared with placebo ( 35.7 % ) at day 7 ( P < 0.005 ) .,3
"At day30 , treatment success was 87 % and 46 % in synbiotic and placebo group , respectively ( P < 0.01 ) .",3
"Symptom resolution was also higher in synbiotic group ( 39 % ) compared with placebo ( 7 % ) at day 7 ( P < 0.03 ) but not at day 30 ( 56 % vs. 36 % , P = 0.24 ) .",3
We encountered no complication related to synbiotic use .,3
This synbiotic ( a mixture of seven probiotic strains plus FOS ) significantly improved colic symptoms in comparison with placebo .,4
The efficacy of ET given in a daily dose of 90 mg was much higher than that of the drug used thrice or less weekly in the patients with axSpA .,4
"In group 1 there were 27 ( 90 % ) males and 3 ( 10 % ) females , while group 2 had 28 ( 93.3 % ) males and 2 ( 6.7 % ) females .",3
The infection rates were observed to be 2 ( 7 % ) in group 1 and 8 ( 26.6 % ) ( p < 0.038 ) in group 2 .,3
The recurrence rate was only 1 ( 3.3 % ) in group 1 compared to 4 ( 13.3 % ) in group 2 .,3
Average hospital stay was 1.630.67 days group 1 and 2.81.24 days in group 2 .,3
"Modified Limberg 's flap closure is an effective treatment modality for pilonidal sinus disease with 1.5 times less infection rate , 4 times less recurrence rate and 40 % in-hospital time .",4
"Between October 2007 and November 2011 , 1099 very preterm infants from Australia and New Zealand were randomized .",3
"Rates of definite late-onset sepsis ( 16.2 % ) , NEC of Bell stage 2 or more ( 4.4 % ) , and mortality ( 5.1 % ) were low in controls , with high breast milk feeding rates ( 96.9 % ) .",3
"No significant difference in definite late-onset sepsis or all-cause mortality was found , but this probiotic combination reduced NEC of Bell stage 2 or more ( 2.0 % versus 4.4 % ; relative risk 0.46 , 95 % confidence interval 0.23 to 0.93 , P = .03 ; number needed to treat 43 , 95 % confidence interval 23 to 333 ) .",3
"The probiotics B infantis , S thermophilus , and B lactis significantly reduced NEC of Bell stage 2 or more in very preterm infants , but not definite late-onset sepsis or mortality .",4
Treatment with this combination of probiotics appears to be safe .,4
"Of the 981 enrolled smoking parents , 710 ( 72.4 % ) were contacted at 12 months .",3
"The odds of having successfully quit at 12 months was 4.12 times more likely ( 95 % CI = 1.57 , 10.8 ) for parents who believed that quitting will benefit their children ; 1.68 times more likely ( 95 % CI = 1.13 , 2.51 ) for parents with more than a high school education ; and 1.74 times greater ( 95 % CI = 1.13 , 2.68 ) for parents with children under age 3 years .",3
Another factor associated with having successfully quit was a prior quit attempt .,3
Providers ' smoking-cessation advice and support should begin early and underscore how cessation will benefit the health and well-being of patients ' children .,4
"Additionally , parents who have recently attempted to quit may be particularly primed for another attempt .",4
"At M12 , 32.3 % of the patients had used non-prescribed opioids during the previous month .",3
A good patient-physician relationship was the most influential factor associated with not using non-prescribed opioids after one year .,3
"Living with a heroin user after one year of treatment , using cocaine during treatment and hazardous alcohol consumption at enrolment were all associated with an increased risk of non-prescribed opioid use at M12 .",3
"Analysis of attributable fractions indicated that living with a heroin user at M12 accounted for 21 % of patients reporting non-prescribed opioid use at M12 , while the lack of a good relationship with the physician accounted for 26 % .",3
"The attributable risk approach suggests that continued non-prescribed opioid use by a considerable proportion of individuals could potentially be reduced by improving patient-physician relationships , enhancing care for co-dependent patients and encouraging patients to modify their social network .",4
"CRP concentrations in women diagnosed with breast cancer were associated with death due to any cause , death due to breast cancer , and additional breast cancer events , after adjustment for sociodemographic and cancer characteristics ( lnCRP : P < 0.05 for all three outcomes ) .",3
"The HR for women with ( vs. without ) acute inflammation suggests a threshold effect on overall survival , rather than a dose-response relationship ( 10.0 mg/L vs. < 1 mg/L : HR , 1.96 ; 95 % CI , 1.22-3 .13 ) .",3
"Associations were similar for breast cancer-specific mortality ( HR , 1.91 ; 95 % CI , 1.13-3 .23 ) and any additional breast cancer-related event ( HR , 1.69 ; 95 % CI , 1.17-2 .43 ) .",3
Acute inflammation status ( CRP 10 mg/L ) may be an important independent biomarker for long-term survival in breast cancer survivors .,4
Interventions to decrease circulating CRP concentrations in breast cancer survivors with acute inflammation may improve prognosis .,4
"A total of 101 patients ( 79 male ) , mean age 66 ( + / -11 ) , 50 ECI-guided and 51 control cases were enrolled in the study .",3
CTI block was achieved in all .,3
There were no acute complications .,3
All patients were alive at follow-up .,3
"CTI block was achieved in a single pass in 36 ECI-guided and 30 control cases ( p = 0.16 ) , and at 20 min post-ablation , re-conduction was seen in 5 and 12 cases , respectively ( p = 0.07 ) .",3
"There was no significant difference in total procedure time ( 62.733 vs. 62.333 min , p = 0.92 ) , RF requirement ( 580312 vs. 574287 s , p = 0.11 ) or fluoroscopy time ( 718577 vs. 721583 s , p = 0.78 ) .",3
"After 64 months , recurrence of flutter had occurred in 1 ( 2 % ) ECI vs. 8 ( 16 % ) control cases ( OR 0.13 , 95 % CI 0.01-1 .08 , p = 0.06 ) .",3
"ECI-guided CTI ablation demonstrated a non-statistically significant reduction in late recurrence of atrial flutter , at no cost to procedural time , radiation exposure or RF requirement .",4
"The differences in DMVF at 12weeks were -3.383.63 and -2.453.73 in the imidafenacin and fesoterodine groups , respectively , and the difference was not significant between the two groups .",3
"Imidafenacin was non-inferior to fesoterodine , and the lower limit of 95 % two-sided confidence intervals was -0.53 .",3
The other six secondary end-points and variables for safety analysis showed no difference between the two groups .,3
"Imidafenacin was non-inferior to fesoterodine in terms of efficacy , and showed no significant difference in terms of safety .",4
"Women indicating that they had been in labour for 24hours or longer at the time of hospital admission were at elevated risk for cesarean birth , relative risk ( RR ) 1.40 , ( 95 % Confidence Intervals 1.15-1 .72 ) , admission with a cervical dilation of 3cm or less , RR 1.21 ( 1.07-1 .36 ) , more obstetrical interventions including continuous electronic fetal monitoring RR 1.11 ( 1.03-1 .20 ) , augmentation of labour RR 1.33 ( 1.23-1 .44 ) , use of narcotic RR 1.21 ( 1.06-1 .37 ) and epidural analgesia RR 1.18 ( 1.09-1 .28 ) .",3
Adverse neonatal outcomes did not differ apart from a significant increase in meconium-stained amniotic fluid RR 1.60 ( 1.09-2 .35 ) .,3
A single question asked of women on presentation to hospital was an important predictor of cesarean birth and may have utility in identifying women who would benefit from close observation and more active management of labour .,4
"The 8-week reduction in vasomotor symptom frequency from baseline relative to placebo was similar for escitalopram at -1.4 per day ( 95 % confidence interval [ CI ] -2.7 to -0.2 ) , low-dose E2 at -2.4 ( 95 % CI -3.4 to -1.3 ) , and venlafaxine at -1.8 ( 95 % CI -2.8 to -0.8 ) ; vasomotor symptom bother reduction was minimal and did not vary across these three pharmacologic interventions ( mean -0.2 to -0.3 relative to placebo ) .",3
"No effects on vasomotor symptom frequency or bother were seen with aerobic exercise , yoga , or omega-3 supplements .",3
"These analyses suggest that escitalopram , low-dose E2 , and venlafaxine provide comparable , modest reductions in vasomotor symptom frequency and bother among women with moderate hot flushes .",4
"Both groups revealed significant improvement , as indicated by reductions in mean TFI index scores .",3
Differences between groups at 3 months were not statistically significant .,3
"However , the experimental group showed a mean reduction in the TFI score that was 6.4 points greater than that for the control group .",3
"The difference approached significance ( p = 0.09 ) , suggesting that a larger group of participants may have resulted in a significant difference between groups .",3
"This possibility is tempered by the fact that effect sizes , which control for variation , were very similar between groups .",3
Results of this study suggest that the use of hearing aids alone or hearing aids plus the use of sound generators both provide significant benefit with respect to alleviating effects of tinnitus .,4
A larger controlled clinical trial is needed to obtain more definitive results regarding the two configurations of hearing aids .,4
Time required to suture was significantly lower in the group operated on with a bidirectional suture than in groups with traditional sutures ( P < .001 ) .,3
No significant difference was observed in operative time among the study groups .,3
The degree of surgical difficulty was significantly lower in the Quill group than in the other groups .,3
Use of barbed sutures reduces the time required to repair a uterine wall defect during laparoscopic myomectomy .,4
"In a follow-up of patients carried out at 3 months , 6 months , and 1 year after the surgery , there were no wound dehiscence , no bleeding , and no other potential major complications .",4
"The overall incidence rates were 1.6 / 100 person-years at risk ( PYAR ) for NG , 3.9 / 100 PYAR for CT and 15.3 / 100 PYAR for TV .",3
"For BufferGel versus placebo gel , HRs were 0.99 ( 95 % CI 0.49 to 2.00 ) , 1.00 ( 95 % CI 0.64 to 1.57 ) and 0.95 ( 95 % CI 0.71 to 1.25 ) for prevention of NG , CT and TV , respectively .",3
"For PRO 2000 , HRs were 1.66 ( 95 % CI 0.90 to 3.06 ) , 1.16 ( 95 % CI 0.76 to 1.79 ) and 1.18 ( 95 % CI 0.90 to 1.53 ) for prevention of NG , CT and TV , respectively .",3
"The incidence of STIs was high during HIV Prevention Trials Network 035 despite provision of free condoms and comprehensive risk-reduction counselling , highlighting the need for effective STI prevention programmes in this population .",4
"Unfortunately , candidate microbicides BufferGel and PRO2000 had no protective effect against gonorrhoea , chlamydia or trichomoniasis .",4
There is a solid evidence that basiliximab can significantly decrease the risk of acute rejection in kidney transplant recipients without increasing adverse events .,4
This can allow decreased dosage or avoidance of glucocorticoids and reduced dosage of calcineurin inhibitors .,4
"On the basis of efficacy , tolerability , ease of administration , and cost effectiveness , basiliximab may be considered the drug of choice for the prophylaxis of acute rejection in standard renal transplant recipients .",4
"Of 276 patients initiated on the KD , 65 patients ( 24 % ) attained seizure freedom for a minimum of 1month .",3
The majority of these patients had daily seizures .,3
The median time to seizure freedom after KD initiation was 1.5 months .,3
"Seizures recurred in 53 patients ( 82 % ) , with a median time to seizure recurrence of 3months .",3
"However , seizure frequency after initial recurrence remained far less than baseline .",3
No clinical features were identified as risk factors for seizure recurrence .,3
Seizure recurrence on the KD after 1month of seizure freedom most often occurred as occasional breakthrough seizures and not a return to baseline seizure frequency .,4
This study provides evidence to support the continued use of the KD in patients with initial seizure freedom even after breakthrough seizures .,4
A PowerPoint slide summarizing this article is available for download in the Supporting Information section here .,4
"No differences were observed in the overall median scores between the intervention ( median 5.2 ; 25th percentile [ Q1 ] 4.9 , 75th percentile [ Q3 ] 5.5 ) and the control groups ( median 5.3 , Q1 4.9 , Q3 5.6 ) ( P = 0.77 ) .",3
The internal consistency of the 2 main subcomponents was good ( Cronbach 's alpha = 0.83 ) to acceptable ( Cronbach 's alpha = 0.69 ) .,3
A Web-based and a lecture-based cultural competency training strategies were associated with equally high positive attitudes among 1st-year medical students .,4
These findings warrant further evaluation of Web-based cultural competency educational interventions .,4
"In group II , the needle punctures to detect the deposit were significantly lower than in group I ( p < 0.0001 ) .",3
Operation time to localize the deposit was also significantly less in group II ( p < 0.033 ) .,3
"In both groups , patients improved significantly with increased shoulder function ( p < 0.0001 ) and decreased pain ( p < 0.0001 ) 2weeks and 9months ( p < 0.001 ) after surgery .",3
The difference between the groups was not significant .,3
Excellent radiological findings were obtained in both groups after 9months .,3
Intraoperative US significantly facilitates the detection of calcific deposits during arthroscopic debridement by speeding up surgery and reducing the number of needle punctures .,4
"Hence , we have changed our method of detecting calcific deposits intraoperatively from fluoroscopy to ultrasound .",4
"Both groups did not differ with respect to treatment duration ( tunneled : 109 hours 46 , taped : 97 37 ) and postoperative pain scores .",3
"Tunneling significantly reduced average extent ( tunneled : 3 mm 7 , taped : 10 18 ) and incidence of clinically relevant EC dislocation ( > 20 mm , tunneled : 1/60 , taped : 9/61 ) .",3
"Bacterial contamination showed a tendency to be lower in patients with tunneled catheters ( 8/59 , taped : 14/54 , P = 0.08 ) .",3
Thorough fixation of EC by tunneling and suturing decreases the incidence and extent of dislocation and potentially even that of bacterial contamination .,4
Futility analysis led to stopping of the trial after recruitment of 100 patients .,3
"Fifty patients were randomly assigned to general anaesthesia , and 48 patients to spinal anaesthesia without sedation or postoperative opioids .",3
"At 3 months , POCD was detected in 6.8 % [ 95 % confidence interval ( CI ) : 1.4-18 .7 % ] of patients in the general anaesthesia group and 19.6 % ( 95 % CI : 9.4-33 .9 % ) in the spinal group ( P = 0.07 ) .",3
"At 7 days after operation , the incidence of POCD was 4.1 % ( 95 % CI : 0.5-14 % ) in the general anaesthesia group and 11.9 % ( 95 % CI : 4.0-26 .6 % ) in the spinal group ( P = 0.16 ) .",3
"We found no significant difference in the rates of POCD when comparing general anaesthesia with spinal anaesthesia , suggesting that the surgical or procedural process itself may contribute to the development of POCD .",4
"There was no significant difference in the time to union , the time of recovery to work , function , alignment and total AOFAS scores between the two groups ( P = 0.704 , 0.835 , 0.551 , 0.716 and 0.212 , respectively ) .",3
"The mean operating time and radiation time were longer in the MIPPO group than in the CIEF group ( 85.312.5 vs. 73.212.0 minutes , P = 0.002 , and 3.11.5 vs. 2.11.2 minutes , P = 0.019 , respectively ) .",3
"Wound complications were more common in the MIPPO group ( 18.2 % vs. 0 % with CIEF , P = 0.105 ) .",3
"There was a trend for patients with MIPPO to have a higher incidence of ankle pain ( 31.8 % vs. 9.1 % with CIEF , P = 0.135 ) .",3
Painful implants were removed in 31.8 % of patients with MIPPO versus 9.1 % with CIEF ( P = 0.135 ) .,3
Of the 165 self-tapping locking screws of the locking plates seven ( four patients ) were removed with some difficulty because of stripping of the hexagonal recess .,3
Our results indicated that both CIEF and MIPPO were all efficient methods for treating distal third tibial fractures .,4
"However , CIEF had the advantages of a shorter operating and radiation time , less wound complication and ankle pain , less secondary operations for implant removal and easier removal of the implants .",4
"Between Dec 9 , 2010 , and Sept 21 , 2012 , we randomly assigned 884 patients to receive dulaglutide 15 mg ( n = 295 ) , dulaglutide 075 mg ( n = 293 ) , or glargine ( n = 296 ) .",3
"At 26 weeks , the adjusted mean change in HbA1c was greater in patients receiving dulaglutide 15 mg ( -164 % [ 95 % CI -178 to -150 ] , -1793 mmol/mol [ -1944 to -1642 ] ) and dulaglutide 075 mg ( -159 % [ -173 to -145 ] , -1738 mmol/mol [ -1889 to -1587 ] ) than in those receiving glargine ( -141 % [ -155 to -127 ] , -1541 mmol/mol [ -1692 to -1390 ] ) .",3
"The adjusted mean difference versus glargine was -022 % ( 95 % CI -038 to -007 , -240 mmol/mol [ -415 to -077 ] ; p = 0005 ) for dulaglutide 15 mg and -017 % ( -033 to -002 , -186 mmol/mol [ -361 to -022 ] ; p = 0015 ) for dulaglutide 075 mg .",3
Five ( < 1 % ) patients died after randomisation because of septicaemia ( n = 1 in the dulaglutide 15 mg group ) ; pneumonia ( n = 1 in the dulaglutide 075 mg group ) ; cardiogenic shock ; ventricular fibrillation ; and an unknown cause ( n = 3 in the glargine group ) .,3
"We recorded serious adverse events in 27 ( 9 % ) patients in the dulaglutide 15 mg group , 44 ( 15 % ) patients in the dulaglutide 075 mg group , and 54 ( 18 % ) patients in the glargine group .",3
"The most frequent adverse events , arising more often with dulaglutide than glargine , were nausea , diarrhoea , and vomiting .",3
Dulaglutide in combination with lispro resulted in a significantly greater improvement in glycaemic control than did glargine and represents a new treatment option for patients unable to achieve glycaemic targets with conventional insulin treatment .,4
"Of 1815 patients recruited , 365 ( 20 % ) died during the study and 813 ( 45 % ) provided data at 12 weeks .",3
"Controlling for baseline values , anthropometric measures were consistently higher at 12-week ART in the LNS-VM than in the LNS group but statistically significant only for calf and mid-upper arm circumferences and triceps skinfold .",3
Appetite did not differ between groups .,3
"Using piecewise mixed-effects quadratic models including all patients and time points , the main effects of LNS-VM were seen after starting ART and were significant for weight , body mass index , and mid-upper arm circumference .",3
"Provision of high levels of vitamins and minerals to patients referred for ART , delivered with substantial macronutrients , increased nutritional recovery but did not seem to act through treatment group differences in appetite .",4
"On the rehydration day , each of the subjects consumed an average of 2040 mL ( range ; 1800-2500 mL ) ORS .",3
"Physiological data revealed that subjects when dehydrated lost more weight from exercise than subjects when rehydrated had a larger heart rate increase , a higher tympanic temperature , and a higher urine osmolality .",3
"Subjective data revealed that the subjects reported significantly stronger thirst while dehydrated than while rehydrated with ORS , although the levels of hunger and anxiety and mood did not significantly differ between conditions .",3
"The cold pressor test robustly activated the pain-related neural network , notably the anterior cingulate cortex , insula , and thalamus .",3
"Such activations in the dehydrated subjects were greater than those in the rehydrated subjects in terms of peak and cluster , accompanied by a decrease in pain threshold ( P = 0.001 ) .",3
"Our findings suggest that dehydration brings about increased brain activity related to painful stimuli together with enhanced thirst , whereas rehydration with ORS alleviates thirst and decreases brain activity related to painful stimuli .",4
All participants tolerated the study well .,3
Patients treated with 100 % oxygen had a higher alveolar-arterial oxygen pressure gradient ( primary outcome ) compared with patients treated with 30 % oxygen ( 25 vs. 20 mmHg ) and compared with their baseline at the 60-min measurement ( 25 vs. 17 mmHg ) .,3
"At the 60-min measurement , arterial partial pressure of oxygen was lower in the 100 % group ( 62 vs. 67 mmHg ) .",3
Arterial partial pressure of carbon dioxide and pH were not different between groups or measurements .,3
"In this experiment , the authors examined oxygen breathing during emergence-a widely practiced maneuver known to generate pulmonary blood flow heterogeneity .",4
"In the observed cohort of patients already presenting with pulmonary blood flow disturbances , emergence on oxygen resulted in deterioration of oxygen-related blood gas parameters .",4
"In the perioperative care of patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease , oxygen breathing during emergence from anesthesia may need reconsideration .",4
"Rifampicin significantly increased the mean area under the plasma concentration-time curve ( AUC ) of ( R ) - and ( S ) - fexofenadine ( 3.10-fold and 3.48-fold , respectively ) and decreased the renal clearance of ( R ) - and ( S ) - fexofenadine ( 0.40-fold and 0.47-fold , respectively ) , causing marked differences in the mean amounts of these enantiomers excreted into the urine in the rifampicin phase ( P < 0.001 ) .",4
These results indicated that multiple doses of rifampicin 450 mg may be sufficient to inhibit the renal influx transporter and OATP-mediated hepatic uptake of both enantiomers .,4
"Moreover , these effects may be greater than the P-gp-inductive effects of rifampicin .",4
"Therefore , the interactive mechanism of multidose rifampicin may occur through a combination of OATP and P-gp transporters , thereby altering the pharmacokinetics of fexofenadine enantiomers .",4
"In this study of rifampicin 450 mg , the interactive magnitude of the mean AUC values of fexofenadine enantiomers was higher than that observed in the previous study of rifampicin 600 mg , and no dose-dependent inhibitory effects of rifampicin were observed .",4
These effects may be clinically significant in patients receiving fexofenadine and rifampicin .,4
"Both groups experienced a significant reduction in the VAS and mNPQ scores after 1 month ; however , while no further improvement was observed in group 2 at 60 days , group 1 showed a further VAS reduction ( p < 0.001 ) .",3
"In addition , in the mNPQ at 60 days , more patients in group 1 than in group 2 reported that their neck pain was improved ( p < 0.01 ) , and they showed greater compliance with prescribed physiotherapy ( p = 0.048 ) .",3
No drug reaction was observed .,3
"Use of ALA/SOD in combination with physiotherapy may be a useful approach to CNP , being antioxidants that act on nerve inflammation and disease progression .",4
These preliminary observations suggest that some interesting goals ( better pain control and physical wellbeing ) can be achieved by multimodal therapy in CNP patients .,4
"Overall , 47 participants ( 38 % ) understood the fluids to be more like food , 41 ( 34 % ) as medicine , 17 ( 14 % ) as both , and 17 ( 14 % ) as ` other ' .",3
"Ethnic minority participants ( n = 34 , 66 % ) were significantly more likely than non-Hispanic European Americans ( n = 30 , 42 % ) to view AH as food , or both as food and medicine ( p = 0.034 ) .",3
"Ethnic differences persisted in the final regression model ( OR 2.7 ; 95 % CI 1.3 to 5.7 , p = 0.010 ) .",3
"No significant differences were detected between patients and caregivers , or across gender , age , caregivers ' relationship to the patients , group assignment , disease severity or cancer type .",3
"AH was perceived as food/nutrition by many cancer patients and caregivers in the study , particularly among ethnic minorities .",4
This perception may lead to greater distress if fluids are discontinued or withheld .,4
Asking patients/caregivers about their AH perceptions may enhance patient/provider communication and culturally appropriate end-of-life care .,4
"The Bavarian Reperfusion Alternatives Evaluation ( BRAVE ) 4 study is an investigator-initiated , randomized , open-label , multicentre trial , designed to test the hypothesis that in STEMI patients with planned primary PCI a strategy based on prasugrel plus bivalirudin is superior to a strategy based on clopidogrel plus heparin in terms of net clinical outcome .",3
"Owing to slow recruitment , the trial was stopped prematurely after enrolment of 548 of 1240 planned patients .",3
"At 30 days , the primary composite endpoint of death , myocardial infarction , unplanned revascularization of the infarct related artery , stent thrombosis , stroke , or bleeding was observed in 42 patients ( 15.6 % ) randomized to prasugrel plus bivalirudin and 40 patients ( 14.5 % ) randomized to clopidogrel plus heparin [ relative risk , 1.09 ; one-sided 97.5 % confidence interval ( CI ) 0-1 .79 , P = 0.680 ] .",3
"The composite ischaemic endpoint of death , myocardial infarction , unplanned revascularization of the infarct-related artery , stent thrombosis , or stroke occurred in 13 patients ( 4.8 % ) in the prasugrel plus bivalirudin group and 15 patients ( 5.5 % ) in the clopidogrel plus heparin group ( relative risk , 0.89 ; 95 % CI 0.40-1 .96 , P = 0.894 ) .",3
"Bleeding according to the HORIZONS-AMI definition was observed in 38 patients ( 14.1 % ) in the prasugrel plus bivalirudin group and 33 patients ( 12.0 % ) in the clopidogrel plus heparin group ( relative risk , 1.18 ; 95 % CI 0.74-1 .88 , P = 0.543 ) .",3
Results were consistent across various subgroups of patients .,3
"In this randomized trial of STEMI patients , we were unable to demonstrate significant differences in net clinical outcome between prasugrel plus bivalirudin and clopidogrel plus heparin .",4
Neither the composite of ischaemic complications nor bleeding were favourably affected by prasugrel plus bivalirudin compared with a regimen of clopidogrel plus unfractionated heparin .,4
"However , the results must be interpreted in view of the premature termination of the trial .",4
The functional SNP rs10245483 upstream from ABCB1 had a significant effect on remission and side effect ratings that was differentially related to medication and cognitive status .,3
Common homozygotes responded better and had fewer side effects with escitalopram and sertraline .,3
"Minor allele homozygotes responded better and had fewer side effects with venlafaxine , with the better response most apparent for patients with cognitive impairment .",3
The functional polymorphism rs10245483 differentially affects remission and side effect outcomes depending on the antidepressant .,4
The predictive power of the SNP for response or side effects was not lessened by the presence of cognitive impairment .,4
One hundred and twenty participants were randomized .,3
"Eighty seven per cent were assessed after 6 months , and 73 % after 18 months .",3
"IPS was more effective than TVR in terms of gaining employment at 18-month follow-up ( 46 % vs. 11 % ; difference 36 % , 95 % CI 18-54 ) , along with the amount of working hours and weeks , longer job tenure periods and income .",3
Cox regression analysis showed that IPS participants gained employment five times quicker than those in TVR .,3
"Ninety per cent of the IPS participants became involved in work , internships or education , i.e. activities integrated in mainstream community settings , while 24 % in the TVR group achieved this .",3
IPS is effective in a Swedish context in terms of gaining employment and becoming integrated within the local community .,4
The welfare system presented obstacles for gaining competitive employment directly and it was indicated that internships delayed time to first competitive employment .,4
"We enrolled 516 individuals between Dec 1 , 2006 , and March 16 , 2010 .",3
Baseline mean intraocular pressure was 196 mm Hg ( SD 46 ) in 258 patients in the latanoprost group and 201 mm Hg ( 48 ) in 258 controls .,3
"At 24 months , mean reduction in intraocular pressure was 38 mm Hg ( 40 ) in 231 patients assessed in the latanoprost group and 09 mm Hg ( 38 ) in 230 patients assessed in the placebo group .",3
Visual field preservation was significantly longer in the latanoprost group than in the placebo group : adjusted hazard ratio ( HR ) 044 ( 95 % CI 028-069 ; p = 00003 ) .,3
"We noted 18 serious adverse events , none attributable to the study drug .",3
This is the first randomised placebo-controlled trial to show preservation of the visual field with an intraocular-pressure-lowering drug in patients with open-angle glaucoma .,4
The study design enabled significant differences in vision to be assessed in a relatively short observation period .,4
"Following the treatment , significant improvements for NPRS and NDI were observed in both the two groups at the end of the first and second week .",3
"The improvements for both NPRS and NDI were higher in the NG than those in the CG , with P < 0.05 .",3
The results of this study indicate that Neurac training can bring additional therapeutic benefits to conventional treatments for patients with CR .,4
"This study is expected to provide insight in the effectiveness , including its cost-effectiveness , and delivery of the SLIMMER diabetes prevention intervention conducted in Dutch primary health care .",4
"Results of this study provide valuable information for primary health care professionals , researchers , and policy makers .",4
"Replicating previous research , children who received lower grades experienced more negative self-feelings ( P < .001 ) .",3
"As predicted , this well-established relationship was significantly attenuated among children who had reflected , 3 weeks previously , on experiences of unconditional regard ( Ps < .03 ) .",3
"Reflecting on unconditional regard specifically reduced negative self-feelings after low grades ( P = .01 ) , not after average or high grades ( Ps > .17 ) .",3
Reflecting on unconditional regard buffered children 's selves against the adverse impact of an academic setback over an extended period of time .,4
Unconditional regard may thus be an important psychological lever to reduce negative self-feelings in youth .,4
"GLP-2 administration resulted in a rapid ( within 30 minutes ) and transient increase in the concentration of TRL apoB-48 , compared with placebo ( P = .03 ) .",3
"Mathematic modeling of stable isotope enrichment and the mass of the TRL apoB-48 suggested that the increase resulted from the release of stored , presynthesized apoB-48 from the gut .",3
"In the validation study , administration of GLP-2 at 7 hours after the meal , in the absence of additional food intake , robustly increased levels of TRL triglycerides ( P = .007 ) , TRL retinyl palmitate ( P = .002 ) , and TRL apoB-48 ( P = .04 ) compared with placebo .",3
Administration of GLP-2 to men causes the release of chylomicrons that comprise previously synthesized and stored apoB-48 and lipids .,4
This transiently increases TRL apoB-48 levels compared with placebo .,4
Clinical trials number at www.clinicaltrials.gov : NCT 01958775 .,4
Twenty-two women completed the study .,3
"Compared with placebo , vitamin D significantly increased 25-hydroxyvitamin D ( mean [ 95 % confidence interval ] in vitamin D group 20.1 [ 15.7 to 24.5 ] ng/mL at baseline and 65.7 [ 52.3 to 79.2 ] ng/mL at 12 weeks ; placebo 22.5 [ 18.1 to 26.8 ] ng/mL at baseline and 23.8 [ 10.4 to 37.2 ] ng/mL at 12 weeks ) .",3
"There were no significant differences in quantitative insulin sensitivity check index and other measures of insulin sensitivity ; however , we observed trends toward lower 2-hour insulin and lower 2-hour glucose .",3
We also observed a protective effect of vitamin D on blood pressure .,3
"In women with PCOS , insulin sensitivity was unchanged with high-dose vitamin D , but there was a trend toward decreased 2-hour insulin and a protective effect on blood pressure .",4
"The models that used only data available at the time of study entry had limited predictive value for revascularization by 6 months or by 5 years ; however , the model incorporating severity of angina during the first 6 months could better predict revascularization ( C statistic = 0.789 ) .",3
"With the possible exception of patients with severe angina and proximal left anterior descending artery disease , this analysis supports the recommendation of the 2012 guidelines for a trial of OMT before revascularization .",4
"Patients could not be identified at the time of catheterization , but a short period of close follow-up during OMT identified the nearly 40 % of patients who underwent revascularization .",4
200 patients with CLBA were randomized to AMT ( n = 103 ) and PG ( n = 97 ) using random numbers .,3
The VAS score and ODI improved significantly following AMT and PG at 6 and 14 weeks compared to baseline .,3
The improvement in pain ( 57.3 % Vs 39.2 % ; P = 0.01 ) and disability ( 65 % Vs 49.5 % ; P = 0.03 ) however was more in AMT group .,3
The composite side effects were similar in both groups .,3
AMT and PG are effective in CLBA but AMT reduced pain and disability significantly compared to PG .,4
"A total of 241 participants were randomized , with 95 % reporting primary outcome data at all time points .",3
"After 12 weeks of treatment , the SMT with home exercise group demonstrated a 10 % greater decrease in pain compared with the HE-alone group , and 5 % change over supervised plus home exercise .",3
A decrease in pain favoring supervised plus HE over HE alone did not reach statistical significance .,3
"Compared with the HE group , both combination groups reported greater improvement at week 12 and more satisfaction at all time points .",3
Multivariate longitudinal analysis incorporating primary and secondary patient-rated outcomes showed that the SMT with HE group was superior to the HE-alone group in both the short - and long-term .,3
No serious adverse events were observed as a result of the study treatments .,3
SMT with HE resulted in greater pain reduction after 12 weeks of treatment compared with both supervised plus HE and HE alone .,4
Supervised exercise sessions added little benefit to the HE-alone program .,4
"There was no statistically significant difference in IOP and corneal topography ( K1 , K2 , SAI , SRI and CY ) between the two groups postoperatively .",3
"The IOP was ( 16.33 6.21 ) mmHg ( 1 mmHg = 0.133 kPa ) , ( 15.67 2.82 ) mmHg , ( 15.35 2.22 ) mmHg and ( 13.10 3.41 ) mmHg in the bromfenac sodium group , and ( 16.87 3.68 ) mmHg , ( 14.05 2.23 ) mmHg , ( 14.39 2.22 ) mmHg and ( 13.18 2.49 ) mmHg in the control group at 10 , 30 , 90 and 180 days , respectively .",3
"The bromfenac sodium group showed significantly better uncorrected visual acuity ( 5.16 0.08 ) than the control group ( 5.02 0.09 ) on day 30 ( t = 2.32 , P < 0.05 ) .",3
"In the bromfenac sodium group , four eyes had visual fatigue , and four eyes had dry eye symptoms on day 180 .",3
Epithelial flaps were all well positioned with satisfying healing process .,3
"Each group had one case ( two eyes ) of haze on day 30 , and the bromfenac sodium group had another case ( 2 eyes ) of new-onset haze on day 60 .",3
"But all the cases of haze were graded 0.5 according to the Fantes Standard , too mild to compromise their visual acuities , and were resolved after frequent topical medication for 1 month .",3
Four patients from the control group were prescribed antiglaucoma medications due to elevated IOP .,3
The refractive status remained stable for patients from both groups .,3
Administration of Bronuck can reduce the amount of or partially substitute for corticosteroids .,4
Mild haze early after LASEK may disappear after intensive treatment .,4
"Most patients had grafts preserved in saline ( 1339 [ 44.4 % ] ) , followed by blood ( 971 [ 32.2 % ] ) and buffered saline ( 507 [ 16.8 % ] ) .",3
Baseline characteristics were similar among groups .,3
"One-year VGF rates were much lower in the buffered saline group than in the saline group ( patient-level odds ratio [ OR ] , 0.59 [ 95 % CI , 0.45-0 .78 ; P < .001 ] ; graft-level OR , 0.63 [ 95 % CI , 0.49-0 .79 ; P < .001 ] ) or the blood group ( patient-level OR , 0.62 [ 95 % CI , 0.46-0 .83 ; P = .001 ] ; graft-level OR , 0.63 [ 95 % CI , 0.48-0 .81 ; P < .001 ] ) .",3
"Use of buffered saline solution also tended to be associated with a lower 5-year risk for death , myocardial infarction , or subsequent revascularization compared with saline ( hazard ratio , 0.81 [ 95 % CI , 0.64-1 .02 ; P = .08 ] ) and blood ( 0.81 [ 0.63-1 .03 ; P = .09 ] ) solutions .",3
Patients undergoing CABG whose vein grafts were preserved in a buffered saline solution had lower VGF rates and trends toward better long-term clinical outcomes compared with patients whose grafts were preserved in saline - or blood-based solutions .,4
"Recruitment and retention rates were 38 % and 91 % , respectively .",3
Adherence was low at 28 % .,3
"Analyses did not suggest statistically significant or clinically important benefits in QOL , fatigue , or physical fitness with the intervention .",3
The level of adherence did not appear to impact outcomes .,3
There were no adverse events .,3
A home-based exercise program for post-treatment AML patients age 40 years or older can be safely delivered with reasonable recruitment and high retention .,4
"However , feasibility was hampered by low adherence .",4
Further research and program modification are needed to better understand and overcome barriers to exercise delivery and adherence in AML survivors .,4
No post-operative sensitivity was reported .,3
"At the 3-year follow-up , 196 restorations - 74 Class I and 122 Class II - were evaluated .",3
"Seven restorations failed ( 3.6 % ) , 4 SDR-CeramX mono + and 3 CeramX mono + only restorations , all of which were Class II .",3
"The main reason for failure was tooth fracture , followed by resin composite fracture .",3
The annual failure rate ( AFR ) for all restorations ( Class I and II ) was 1.2 % for the bulkfilled restorations and 1.0 % for the resin composite-only restorations ( p > 0.05 ) .,3
"For the Class II restorations , the AFR was 2.2 % and 1.6 % , respectively .",3
The 4-mm bulk-fill technique showed good clinical effectiveness during the 3-year follow-up .,4
"Baseline maximum urinary flow rate data were available on 1,371 men with a mean age of 63.1 years and end point data were available on 1,197 .",3
"Tadalafil 5 mg significantly increased maximum urinary flow vs placebo ( median 1.1 vs 0.4 ml per second , p = 0.003 ) .",3
"At a baseline voided volume of 125 to less than 250 ml the median change in the maximum urinary flow rate was 0.9 and 1.2 ml per second ( p = 0.142 ) in 731 patients , at a baseline of 250 to 450 ml the change was -0.3 and 0.7 ml per second ( p = 0.011 ) in 428 , and at a baseline of greater than 450 ml the change was -0.2 and 2.0 ml per second ( p = 0.186 ) in 38 for placebo and tadalafil , respectively .",3
"The difference was 0.3 , 1.0 and 2.2 ml per second , respectively .",3
"At a baseline maximum urinary flow rate of greater than 15 ml per second in 128 patients the median flow rate change was -2.1 and -0.8 ml per second ( p = 0.246 ) , at a maximum of 10 to 15 ml per second in 522 the change was 0.2 and 0.8 ml per second ( p = 0.044 ) , and at a maximum of less than 10 ml per second in 547 the change was 1.2 and 1.8 ml per second ( p = 0.189 ) for placebo and tadalafil , respectively .",3
Tadalafil improved I-PSS ( International Prostate Symptom Score ) voiding subscores significantly vs placebo across all baseline maximum urinary flow subgroups ( each p < 0.001 ) .,3
This integrated analysis revealed a small but statistically significant median maximum urinary flow rate improvement for tadalafil vs placebo .,4
The numerical difference in the maximum urinary flow change from baseline between tadalafil and placebo increased with increased voided volume .,4
"The primary end-point of RUTTS score < 30 % occurred in 99.8 % ( 899/901 ) of Cre8 struts and in 99.6 % ( 1116/1121 ) of Vision/Multilink8 struts ( difference 0.2 , CI 95 % -0.2 to 0.6 , p for noninferiority < 0.001 ) .",3
"The percentage of uncovered/malapposed struts was comparable ( 0.360.64 vs. 0.120.24 , p = 0.145 ) in the two study groups , while both neointimal percentage area ( 8.465.29 vs. 19.8415.93 , p < 0.001 ) and thickness ( 0.070.04 vs. 0.160.12 , p < 0.001 ) were significantly reduced by Cre8 stent .",3
The Cre8 DES at 3 months has comparable strut coverage to Vision/Multilink8 BMS at 1 month while preserving a greater efficacy in neo-intima formation reduction .,4
Further studies to assess clinical implication of these Cre8 characteristics are warranted .,4
The entire group showed no statistically significant differences in survival rates between the patients receiving DEXA or MePRED .,3
"However , an analysis of age groups revealed the benefits of DEXA in children younger than 14 years ( the event-free survival ( EFS ) was 762 and 712 % , respectively ( p = 0.048 ) ; the overall survival ( OS ) was 812 and 772 % , respectively ( p = 0.046 ) ; therapy-induced mortality was 6.4 % ( DEXA ) andl 1.1 % ( MePRED ) ( p = 0.01 4 ) ; the rate of isolated extramedullary relapses was 1.5 % ( DEXA ) and 4.4 % ( MePRED ) ( p = 0.009 ) .",3
"At the same time , EFS and OS in 14-to-18-year-old adolescents were statistically significantly higher than in those who used MePRED ( EFS , 656 and 526 % , respectively ( p = 0.087 ) ; OS , 726 and 616 % , respectively ; ( p = 0 .",3
l 7 ) .,3
The findings suggest that it is possible that the choice of a GCS for ALL therapy must be also based on a patient 's age .,4
There is a need for further studies of this matter in prospective randomized multicenter trials in children and adolescents .,4
"The interventions were acceptable to the local population and perceived as good strategy to make health care services available to community members and thus , to reduce the delays in access to anti-malarial treatment as well as expenses related to patients ' transfer to the health post .",3
The use of malaria rapid diagnostic test ( RDT ) contributed to improving CHWs diagnostic capacity as well as malaria treatment practices .,3
Study participants notified RDT and drugs stock-out as the major risk for sustainability of the intervention at community level .,3
"Combining CCMm and SMC is a well accepted , community-based approach that can contribute to control malaria in areas where malaria transmission is seasonal .",4
"O total of 716 residents finished the study ( 344 cared for by the intervention group physicians , 372 cared for by control physicians ) .",3
Mean age was 84.4 12.7 years ; 73 % were women .,3
"The mean number of inappropriate drugs ( STOPP criteria ) was higher at the end of the study in the control than in the intervention group ( 1.29 1.56 vs 0.81 1.13 ) , as was the number of residents on 6 or more drugs ( 76.5 % vs. 67.0 % ) , using antipsychotics ( 9.1 % vs 3.2 % ) or duplicate medications ( 32.5 % vs 9.2 % ) .",3
The number of fallers increased in the control group ( from 19.3 % to 28 % ) and did not significantly change in the intervention group ( from 25.3 % to 23.9 % ) ; the number of residents with delirium increased in the control group ( from 3.8 % to 9.1 % ) and decreased in the intervention group ( from 6.1 % to 3.2 % ) .,3
"The number of visits to a physician did not change in the control group ( -0.22 , P = .3 ) but were significantly reduced in the intervention group ( -0.76 , P = .01 ) , the same happened with the number of visits to a nurse ( -0.38 , P = .4 in controls , -1.43 in the intervention group , P < .001 ) .",3
Visits to the emergency room and days in hospital significantly increased in the control group ( +0.12 and +0.38 ) but were unchanged in the intervention group ( +0.03 and +0.01 ) .,3
"An educational intervention on drug use is feasible in nursing home physicians and improves the use of inappropriate drugs , use of antipsychotics , and drug duplications in their residents .",4
"It may also improve the risk of delirium and falls , and reduce the use of health care resources .",4
"Time to exhaustion was reduced ( P < 0.05 ) in hot ( -3515 % ) or hypoxia ( -3614 % ) compared to control ( 6128min ) , while hot + hypoxia ( -5120 % ) further compromised exercise capacity ( P < 0.05 ) .",3
"However , the effect of temperature or altitude on end-exercise core temperature ( P = 0.089 and P = 0.070 , respectively ) and rating of perceived exertion ( P > 0.05 ) did not reach significance .",3
"Maximal voluntary contraction torque , voluntary activation ( twitch interpolation ) and peak twitch torque decreased from pre - to post-exercise ( -91 , -41 and -61 % all trials compounded , respectively ; P < 0.05 ) , with no effect of the temperature or altitude .",3
"M-wave amplitude and root mean square activity were reduced ( P < 0.05 ) in hot compared to temperate conditions , while normalized maximal EMG activity did not change .",3
Altitude had no effect on any measured parameters .,3
Moderate hypoxia in combination with heat stress reduces cycling time to exhaustion without modifying neuromuscular fatigue characteristics .,4
"Impaired oxygen delivery or increased cardiovascular strain , increasing relative exercise intensity , may have also contributed to earlier exercise cessation .",4
In total 34 patients received active T-PEMF once a day and 31 patients twice daily .,3
"After 5 weeks of therapy remission was obtained in 26.5 % and 32.3 % on one dose and two doses of T-PEMF , respectively .",3
"After 8 weeks the rate of remission was 73.5 % and 67.7 % , respectively .",3
"The side effects as measured by the Udvalget for Kliniske Undersgelser scale showed a better toleration of the antidepresssive medication in both treatment groups , which was reflected by the WHO-5 well-being scale with increased scores in both groups of patients .",3
The high remission rate obtained by the T-PEMF augmentation was not a dose effect ( one versus two daily T-PEMF sessions ) but was explained by the extension of the treatment period from 5 to 8 weeks .,4
Final Psoriasis Area Severity Index scores were reduced within each group .,3
"The UVA group achieved results comparable to PUVA until session 24 but failed to match it at final evaluation , with significantly better clinical , immunohistochemical , and histopathological results achieved by PUVA ( P0 .05 ) .",3
Both modalities caused a reduction in dermal lymphocytic counts and epidermal bcl-2 expression .,3
BB-UVA appears to be safe and acceptable for the treatment of chronic plaque psoriasis possibly through bcl-2-mediated apoptosis of keratinocytes and epidermal lymphocytes .,4
This study protocol outlines a design that aims to examine the transparency mechanism and to evaluate the effect of public reporting on prescription .,4
The research design is significant in the field of public policy .,4
"Furthermore , this study intends to fill the gap of the investigation of the transparency mechanism and the evaluation of public reporting on prescription .",4
"In the small Phase I safety trial , reactions were primarily against the 2.5 g dose of both antigens and Rees control antigen , which were then excluded from subsequent studies .",3
"In the Phase II , Stage A/B ramped-up safety study , 26 % of subjects ( 13 of 50 ) showed induration against the high dose of each antigen , and 4 % ( 2 of 50 ) reacted to the low dose of MLSA-LAM .",3
"Phase II , Stage C safety and initial efficacy trial showed that both antigens at the low dose exhibited low sensitivity at 20 % and 25 % in BT/TT leprosy patients , but high specificity at 100 % and 95 % compared to TB patients .",3
The high dose of both antigens showed lower specificity ( 70 % and 60 % ) and sensitivity ( 10 % and 15 % ) .,3
BL/LL leprosy patients were anergic to the leprosy antigens .,3
MLSA-LAM and MLCwA at both high ( 1.0 g ) and low ( 0.1 g ) doses were found to be safe for use in humans without known exposure to leprosy and in target populations .,4
"At a sensitivity rate of 20-25 % these antigens are not suitable as a skin test for the detection of the early stages of leprosy infection ; however , the degree of specificity is impressive given the presence of cross-reactive antigens in these complex native M. leprae preparations .",4
"There were no statistically significant associations noted between polymorphisms in any of the genes and overall survival , disease-free survival ( DFS ) , and toxicity in the overall analyses .",3
"Nevertheless , there was a trend toward worse DFS among patients with the variant allele of MTHFR C677T compared with wild-type , particularly in treatment arm 2 , in which patients with the MTHFR C677T TT genotype had worse overall survival ( hazards ratio , 1.76 ; 95 % confidence interval , 1.06-2 .93 [ P = .03 ] ) and DFS ( hazards ratio , 1.84 ; 95 % confidence interval , 1.12-3 .03 [ P = .02 ] ) compared with those with homozygous wild-type .",3
"In addition , there was a trend toward reduced hematological toxicity among patients with variants of SLC19A1 G80A in treatment arm 1 ( P for trend , .06 ) and reduced esophagitis/stomatitis noted among patients with variants of TSER in treatment arm 3 ( P for trend , .06 ) .",3
Genetic variability in folate-metabolizing enzymes was found to be associated only to a limited degree with clinical outcomes among patients with rectal cancer treated with 5-FU .,4
447 eligible patients were randomised to the intervention group ( n = 225 ) or the control group ( n = 222 ) .,3
377 ( 84 % ) participants completed follow-up for questionnaires at 6 months and 295 ( 66 % ) for questionnaires at 12 months .,3
"Women in the intervention group reported fewer prolapse symptoms ( ie , a significantly greater reduction in the pelvic organ prolapse symptom score [ POP-SS ] ) at 12 months than those in the control group ( mean reduction in POP-SS from baseline 3.77 [ SD 5.62 ] vs 2.09 [ 5.39 ] ; adjusted difference 1.52 , 95 % CI 0.46-2 .59 ; p = 0.0053 ) .",3
Findings were robust to missing data .,3
"Eight adverse events ( six vaginal symptoms , one case of back pain , and one case of abdominal pain ) and one unexpected serious adverse event , all in women from the intervention group , were regarded as unrelated to the intervention or to participation in the study .",3
One-to-one pelvic floor muscle training for prolapse is effective for improvement of prolapse symptoms .,4
"Long-term benefits should be investigated , as should the effects in specific subgroups .",4
"Two babies entered the randomised trial ; 1 recovered rapidly on PD , the other remained on the Nidus as PD failed .",3
"Additionally , 9 babies were treated on the Nidus on humanitarian grounds : 3 because of failed PD , and 3 with permanent kidney failure later converted to conventional HD .",3
"We haemodialysed 10 babies weighing between 1.8 and 5.9 kg for 2,475 h during 354 Nidus sessions without any clinically important incidents , and without detectable haemolysis .",3
Single-lumen vascular access was used with no blood priming of circuits .,3
"The urea , creatinine and phosphate clearances using the Nidus were around 1.5 to 2.0 ml/min in piglets and babies , and were consistently higher than PD clearances , which ranged from about 0.2 to 0.8 ml/min ( p0 .0002 for each chemical ) .",3
"Ultrafiltration was achieved to microlitre precision by the Nidus , but varied widely with PD .",3
Fluid removal using conventional HD was imprecise and resulted in some hypovolaemic episodes requiring correction .,3
"The Nidus can provide HD in the Pediatric Intensive Care Unit ( PICU ) and outpatient intermittent HD without blood priming for babies weighing < 8 kg , It generates higher dialysis clearances than PD , and delivers more precise ultrafiltration control than either PD or conventional HD .",4
Increased 24-h UGE was seen in the canagliflozin group compared with a reduction in the placebo group at both week 1 ( 91.8 vs. -2.4 g ) and week 12 ( 82.6 vs. -0.4 g ) .,3
Canagliflozin also reduced both FPG and HbA1c .,3
Reductions in body weight and blood pressure were observed at weeks 1 and 12 .,3
"Canagliflozin decreased plasma volume compared with an increase with placebo at week 1 ( -5.4 vs. 4.3 % ; p = 0.02 ) , but this was largely attenuated at week 12 ( 4.6 vs. 5.8 % ; p = 0.76 ) .",3
"A modest numerical increase in urine volume was observed with canagliflozin at week 1 that was attenuated at week 12 ; other measures of volume status ( i.e. blood urea nitrogen , serum creatinine and haematocrit ) remained modestly increased with canagliflozin at week 12 .",3
Canagliflozin provided sustained effects on UGE and FPG over 12 weeks and a transient reduction in plasma volume that was largely attenuated by week 12 .,4
"A total of 790 patients ( median age , 63 years ) underwent randomization .",3
"After a median follow-up of 28.9 months , the median overall survival was 13.6 months longer with ADT plus docetaxel ( combination therapy ) than with ADT alone ( 57.6 months vs. 44.0 months ; hazard ratio for death in the combination group , 0.61 ; 95 % confidence interval [ CI ] , 0.47 to 0.80 ; P < 0.001 ) .",3
"The median time to biochemical , symptomatic , or radiographic progression was 20.2 months in the combination group , as compared with 11.7 months in the ADT-alone group ( hazard ratio , 0.61 ; 95 % CI , 0.51 to 0.72 ; P < 0.001 ) .",3
The rate of a prostate-specific antigen level of less than 0.2 ng per milliliter at 12 months was 27.7 % in the combination group versus 16.8 % in the ADT-alone group ( P < 0.001 ) .,3
"In the combination group , the rate of grade 3 or 4 febrile neutropenia was 6.2 % , the rate of grade 3 or 4 infection with neutropenia was 2.3 % , and the rate of grade 3 sensory neuropathy and of grade 3 motor neuropathy was 0.5 % .",3
Six cycles of docetaxel at the beginning of ADT for metastatic prostate cancer resulted in significantly longer overall survival than that with ADT alone .,4

"This double-blind , multicentre study randomized 71 AHF patients with pulmonary capillary wedge pressure ( PCWP ) 18 mmHg , systolic blood pressure ( BP ) 115 mmHg , and estimated glomerular filtration rate 30 mL/min/1 .73 m ( 2 ) to serelaxin ( n = 34 ) or placebo ( n = 37 ) within 48 h of hospitalization .",3
Co-primary endpoints were peak change from baseline in PCWP and cardiac index ( CI ) during the first 8 h of infusion .,3
"Among 63 patients eligible for haemodynamic analysis ( serelaxin , n = 32 ; placebo , n = 31 ) , those treated with serelaxin had a significantly higher decrease in peak PCWP during the first 8 h of infusion ( difference vs. placebo : -2.44 mmHg , P = 0.004 ) .",3
Serelaxin showed no significant effect on the peak change in CI vs. placebo .,3
"Among secondary haemodynamic endpoints , a highly significant reduction in pulmonary artery pressure ( PAP ) was observed throughout the serelaxin infusion ( largest difference in mean PAP vs. placebo : -5.17 mmHg at 4 h , P < 0.0001 ) .",3
"Right atrial pressure , systemic/pulmonary vascular resistance , and systolic/diastolic BP decreased from baseline with serelaxin vs. placebo and treatment differences reached statistical significance at some time points .",3
Serelaxin administration improved renal function and decreased N-terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide levels vs. placebo .,3
Treatment with serelaxin was well tolerated with no apparent safety concerns .,3
The haemodynamic effects of serelaxin observed in the present study provide plausible mechanistic support for improvement in signs and symptoms of congestion observed with this agent in AHF patients .,4

"Of 193 patients randomized to treatment , 144 patients completed the study ( 75.3 % of quetiapine XR group [ n = 70 ] ; 74.0 % of placebo group [ n = 74 ] ) .",3
"Least squares mean changes in CDRS-R total score at week 8 were : -29.6 ( SE , 1.65 ) with quetiapine XR and -27.3 ( SE , 1.60 ) with placebo , a between-treatment group difference of -2.29 ( SE , 1.99 ; 95 % CI , -6.22 , 1.65 ; p = 0.25 ; mixed-model for repeated measures analysis ) .",3
Rates of response and remission did not differ significantly between treatment groups .,3
The safety profile of quetiapine XR was broadly consistent with the profile reported previously in adult studies of quetiapine XR and pediatric studies of quetiapine immediate-release ( IR ) .,3
"Potentially clinically significant elevations in clinical chemistry values included triglycerides ( 9.3 % , quetiapine XR ; 1.4 % , placebo group ) and thyroid stimulating hormone ( 4.7 % , quetiapine XR ; 0 % , placebo group ) .",3
An adverse event potentially related to diabetes mellitus occurred in 3.3 % of the quetiapine XR versus no adverse events in the placebo group .,3
Quetiapine XR did not demonstrate efficacy relative to placebo in this 8 week study of pediatric bipolar depression .,4
Quetiapine XR was generally safe and well tolerated .,4
"Compared with patients randomized to usual care , full coverage patients adherent to statin , - blocker , or angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor/angiotensin receptor blocker were significantly less likely to experience the study 's primary outcome ( hazard ratio [ HR ] range 0.64-0 .81 ) .",3
"In contrast , nonadherent patients derived no benefit ( HR range 0.98-1 .04 , P .01 for the difference in HRs between adherent and nonadherent patients ) .",3
"Partially adherent patients had no reduction in clinical outcomes for any of the drugs evaluated , although their achieved adherence was higher than that among controls .",3
Achieving high levels of adherence to each and all guideline-recommended post-MI secondary prevention medication is associated with improved event-free survival .,4
Lower levels of adherence appear less protective .,4
The QTcF interval was not significantly prolonged after administration of ondansetron 4 mg and ramosetron .,3
It was significantly increased from one minute after administration until 7 minutes after ondansetron 8 mg ( Group O8 ) .,3
"The QTcF interval was significantly longer in Group O8 at 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , and 5 minutes .",3
The prophylactic administration 0.3 mg of ramosetron does not increase the QTc interval .,4
Ondansetron 8 mg increases the QTc interval more so than 4 mg of ondansetron .,4
"No baseline differences in age , gender or number of teeth were observed between the two groups .",3
"During the study period , improvements in API and BOP were comparable between groups .",3
"However , improvements in SBI and PD were significantly greater in the test group than in the control group ( p = 0.046 and p = 0.029 , respectively ) .",3
Mechanical interdental plaque control using interdental brushes combined with the use of CPC gel significantly improved 6-month gingival and periodontal outcomes ( SBI and PD ) compared with mechanical cleaning with interdental brushes alone .,4
"The data suggest that developments on the lapse day - either external events or changes in internal states - caused craving and negative affect to rise , cumulating in the lapse .",4
"Nicotine is known to lower background craving and negative affect , but the difference between patch and placebo appeared to dissipate in the hours immediately preceding lapse episodes .",4
Understanding the process by which these symptoms `` spike '' prior to a lapse - and developing treatments to counter it - are worthy research endeavors .,4
"After anesthesia and adequate epidural analgesia , MIP and MEP decreased by 60 % in both groups .",3
"In the placebo group , MIP decreased from a pre-induction value ( median [ range ] ) of 61.8 [ 31.3-96 .1 ] to 19.6 [ 8.3-58 .3 ] cm H2O after extubation without significant variation five and 20 min after placebo .",3

Nonreassuring fetal tracing deemed so serious as to require cesarean delivery is associated with an increased risk of cerebral palsy in preterm neonates .,4
"There was no significant difference between the intervention and control groups in their use of antipsychotics , hypnotics/sedatives , antidepressants or anxiolytics .",3
"As regards admission to the hospital with mental disorders , no significant difference was seen .",3
"These findings were true based on a yearly basis , and when investigating both short-term and a long-term effects of the intervention .",3
There was no interaction with socioeconomic status .,3
"Of the 918 persons with a psychiatric diagnosis before the study start , 303 ( 33 % ) were re-admitted in the intervention period .",3
Pre-screening of psychological status did not influence the psychological impact of screening .,3

This study included the whole Inter99 study population not only study participants .,4
"In total 557 men were included in the final analysis ( self-gripping mesh 270 , sutured mesh 287 ) .",3
"Early postoperative pain scores were lower with self-gripping mesh than with sutured lightweight mesh : mean visual analogue pain score relative to baseline +13 and +86 respectively at discharge ( P = 0033 ) , and mean surgical pain scale score relative to baseline +42 and +97 respectively on day 7 ( P = 0027 ) .",3
There was no significant difference in mid-term ( 1month ) and long-term ( 3months and 1 year ) pain scores between the groups .,3
Surgery was significantly quicker with self-gripping mesh ( mean difference 76min ; P < 0001 ) .,3
"There were no significant differences in reported mesh handling , analgesic consumption , other wound complications , patient satisfaction or hernia recurrence between the groups .",3
"Self-gripping mesh for open inguinal hernia repair was well tolerated and reduced early postoperative pain ( within the first week ) , without increasing the risk of early recurrence .",4
It did not reduce chronic pain .,4
Study staff randomized 124 patients .,3
Observation resulted in a lower inpatient admission rate ( 15 % versus 92 % ; 95 % confidence interval [ CI ] difference -88 % to -66 % ) and shorter hospital length of stay ( 29 versus 47 hours ; 95 % CI difference -28 to -8 ) .,3
Serious outcome rates after hospital discharge were similar for observation versus admission at 30 days ( 3 % versus 0 % ; 95 % CI difference -1 % to 8 % ) and 6 months ( 8 % versus 10 % ; 95 % CI difference -13 % to 9 % ) .,3
"Index hospital costs in the observation group were $ 629 ( 95 % CI difference - $ 1,376 to - $ 56 ) lower than in the admission group .",3
There were no differences in 30-day quality-of-life scores or in patient satisfaction .,3
An ED observation syncope protocol reduced the primary outcomes of admission rate and hospital length of stay .,4
"Analyses of secondary outcomes suggest reduction in index hospital costs , with no difference in safety events , quality of life , or patient satisfaction .",4
Our findings suggest that an ED observation syncope protocol can be replicated and safely reduce resource use .,4

Improvement was seen in all parameters during 52 weeks open label treatment where trough TT levels approached 15 nmol/l .,3
Baseline prostate-specific antigen ( PSA ) was lower in the SEVERE group and increased with TU for 30 weeks and then stabilised .,3
There was no increase in PSA with treatment in the MILD group .,3
"Testosterone undecanoate significantly improves sexual parameters and Ageing Male Symptom Score , but not metabolic factors at 30 weeks in men with SEVERE testosterone deficiency syndrome ( TDS ) .",4
"In men with MILD TDS , significant improvements in metabolic but not sexual parameters were seen , suggesting that there are threshold levels for response to testosterone replacement therapy and that trials of therapy need to achieve sustained therapeutic levels to be effective .",4

"PR resulted in a 9 percentage point ( 95 % CI -17 to -1 ) reduction in the use of oral antibiotics ( adjusted RR = 39 % , P = 0.027 ) , while the use of injectable antibiotics remained unchanged .",3
"PR led to a 7 percentage point reduction ( 95 % CI -14 to 0 ; adjusted RR = 36 % ) in combined use of antibiotics ( P = 0.049 ) , which was largely driven by a significant reduction in male patients ( -7.5 % , 95 % CI -14 to -1 , P = 0.03 ) .",3
"The intervention had little impact on the use of IV injections or infusions , or the total prescription expenditure .",3
"The results suggest that PR could improve prescribing practices in terms of reducing oral antibiotics and combined use of antibiotics ; however , the impacts were limited .",4
"We suggest that PR would probably be enhanced by provider payment reform , management and training for providers , and health education for patients .",4
Treatment efficacy was analyzed by using a t test for paired samples .,3

Vision loss in the blind is caused not only by primary tissue damage but also by a breakdown of synchronization in brain networks .,4
"Because visual field improvements are associated with resynchronization of alpha band coherence , brain connectivity is a key component in partial blindness and in restoration of vision .",4
Twenty-two patients scheduled for CRT underwent dual-chamber temporary pacing .,3
"The ventricular lead was placed at the RV apex ( RVA ) , RVmIVS , and RVOT in random order .",3
"Comprehensive echocardiography was performed in a baseline AAI mode and then at each RV position in dual chamber pacemaker function ( D pacing , D sensing , D dual responses ) mode and repeated on the next day following CRT implantation .",3
Right ventricular apex pacing did not change any of the assessed echocardiography parameters .,3
"Both RVmIVS and RVOT pacing increased LV ejection fraction ( EF ) : 29 7 % at baseline vs. 32 6 % ( P = 0.02 ) and 32 5 % ( P = 0.04 ) with RVmIVS and RVOT pacing , respectively .",3

There were no significant differences in either LVEF or Ts-SD between RVmIVS and RVOT .,3
Right ventricular septal pacing from mid septum or RVOT pacing improves LVEF and LV synchrony in CRT candidates .,4
"Further improvement in LVEF was achieved by CRT , which remains the ` gold standard ' therapy in these patients .",4

"Among the 182 children still in the study at 1 year , 22 ( 12.1 % ) were classified as progressors .",3
"Univariate analysis suggested these children tended to be younger ( 8.5 1.4 years vs 9.3 1.5 years ; P = .023 ) , to have higher myopic spherical equivalent ( SE ) at baseline ( -3.6 1.3 D vs -2.8 1.4 D ; P = .015 ) , and to have 2 myopic parents ( 77.3 % vs 48.1 % ; P = .012 ) .",3
"In nonprogressors , the myopia progression at 1 year was less in the atropine-treated eyes compared with the untreated fellow eye ( +0.16 0.37 D vs -0.73 0.48 D ; P < .001 ) , but in progressors , progression was more similar between eyes ( -0.92 0.31 D vs -1.06 0.44 D ; P = .363 ) .",3
"Regression analysis showed that the risk of being a progressor was 40 % lower with each year of increased age , 43 % lower for every 1.0 D less in myopia at baseline , and 59 % lower for every 1.0 D less in myopic change in the untreated eyes over the first year .",3
"Doctors and parents need to be aware that there is a small group of children ( younger , with higher myopia , and greater tendency of myopic progression ) who may still progress while receiving atropine treatment .",4
"The result showed that the effective rate of one year antihypertensive treatment of arotinolol combined with nifedipine was 51 of 53 , significantly effective ( p < 0.05 ) among three combinations .",3
"It also showed that there was no statistical significant difference ( p > 0.05 ) in controlled rate of morning peak blood pressure between treatment of arotinolol combined with amlodipine and arotinolol combined with nifedipine , but there was a significant difference ( p < 0.01 ) in controlled rate of morning peak blood pressure between arotinolol combined with nifedipine vs. felodipine and arotinolol combined with amlodipine vs. felodipine .",3
"The therapy approached of arotinolol combined with nifedipine or amlodipine could be effective and well-tolerated , and they can be used as the better chosen antihypertensive drug .",4
"Participants in the adapted IMR group showed significantly greater improvements at posttreatment and 1-month follow-up in illness-management knowledge , attitudes toward medication , insight , and negative symptoms on the Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale ( BPRS ) than individuals in the TAU group .",3

It will provide useful information which will help the development of services for patients after critical illness .,4
"Similar to the efficacy trial , the revised intervention demonstrated safety with regard to lymphedema , and led to improvements in lymphedema symptoms , muscular strength , and body image .",3
"Comparison of effects in the effectiveness trial to effects in the efficacy trial revealed larger strength increases in the efficacy trial than in the effectiveness trial ( P < .04 ) , but few other differences were found .",3
"Qualitative implementation data suggested significant barriers around intervention characteristics , payment , eligibility criteria , the referral process , the need for champions ( ie , advocates ) , and the need to adapt during implementation of the intervention , which should be considered in future dissemination and implementation efforts .",3
This trial successfully demonstrated that a physical therapy led strength training program for breast cancer survivors can be implemented in a community setting while retaining the effectiveness and safety of the clinical trial .,4
"However , during the translation process , strategies to reduce barriers to implementation are required .",4

"Among 521 patients , high levels of physical activity before and after the diagnosis were associated with better overall survival ( the multivariate hazard ratios were 0.50 [ 95 % confidence interval = 0.26-0 .98 ] and 0.57 ( 95 % confidence interval = 0.26-1 .40 ] for patients who were very active before and after the diagnosis , respectively , in comparison with inactive patients ) .",3
This was most evident in patients who were 65 years old or older .,3
Physical activity was not significantly associated with breast cancer-specific survival or the relapse-free period .,3
Overall survival was better for patients who were active before and after the diagnosis .,4
"In contrast with previous studies , breast cancer survival and the risk of recurrence were not significantly associated with physical activity .",4
These findings confirmed the need for more studies investigating the use of physical activity to supplement breast cancer treatment in older patients .,4
Memory-trained participants showed higher verbatim recall than non-memory-trained participants .,3
Booster-memory training led to higher verbatim recall .,3
Memory training effects were evident immediately following training and not after 1 year following training .,3
"Results suggest that multifactorial memory training can improve verbatim recall for prose , but the effect does not last without continued intervention .",4

"Overall , PCF was higher with IPPB + MAC than with MI-E + MAC or MI-E alone .",3
"Among the 12 patients who had higher PCF values with IPPB + MAC than with the two other techniques , 9 exhibited mask pressure swings during MI-E exsufflation , with a transient positive-pressure value due to the expiratory flow produced by the combined patient cough effort and MAC .",3
Each of these 9 patients had higher PCF values ( > 5 liters/s ) than did the other 9 patients when using IPPB + MAC .,3
Our results indicate that adding the MI-E device to MAC is unhelpful in patients whose PCF with an insufflation technique and MAC exceeds 5 liters/s .,4
"This is because the expiratory flow produced by the patient 's effort and MAC transitorily exceeds the vacuum capacity of the MI-E device , which therefore becomes a transient load against the PCF .",4
No significant differences were found between the two study groups .,3

"In patients assigned to STICH Hypothesis 2 ( n = 714 ) , no genetic variant met the prespecified Bonferroni-adjusted threshold for statistical significance ( p < 0.002 ) ; however , several variants met nominal prognostic significance : variants in the 2-adrenergic receptor gene ( 2-AR Gln27Glu ) and in the A1-adenosine receptor gene ( A1-717 T/G ) were associated with an increased risk of a subject dying or being hospitalized for a cardiac problem ( p = 0.027 and 0.031 , respectively ) .",3
These relationships remained nominally significant even after multivariable adjustment for prognostic clinical variables .,3
"However , none of the 23 genetic variants influenced all-cause mortality or the combination of death or cardiovascular hospitalization in the STICH Hypothesis 1 population ( n = 532 ) by either univariate or multivariable analysis .",3
We were unable to identify the predictive genotypes in optimally treated patients in these two ischemic heart failure populations .,4
"In Studies 1 and 2 , both canagliflozin doses increased beta cell glucose sensitivity compared with placebo .",3
"Placebo-subtracted least squares mean ( LSM ) ( SEM ) changes were 23 ( 9 ) and 18 ( 9 ) pmol min ( -1 ) m ( -2 ) ( mmol/l ) ( -1 ) with canagliflozin 100 and 300 mg , respectively ( p < 0.002 , Study 1 ) , and 16 ( 8 ) and 10 ( 9 ) pmol min ( -1 ) m ( -2 ) ( mmol/l ) ( -1 ) ( p < 0.02 , Study 2 ) .",3
"In Study 3 , beta cell glucose sensitivity was minimally affected , but the insulin secretion rate at 9 mmol/l glucose increased to similar degrees from baseline with canagliflozin and sitagliptin [ LSM ( SEM ) changes 38 ( 8 ) and 28 ( 9 ) pmol min ( -1 ) m ( -2 ) , respectively ; p < 0.05 for both ] .",3
Treatment with canagliflozin for 6 to 12 months improved model-based measures of beta cell function in three separate Phase 3 studies .,4
"The intervention was associated with significant improvements in dietary attitudes ( P = 0.003 ; F = 8.83 ) , dietary intentions ( P = 0.031 ; F = 4.72 ) , dietary self-efficacy ( P = 0.015 ; F = 5.97 ) , exercise self-efficacy ( P = 0.002 ; F = 9.51 ) , exercise habits ( P = 0.016 ; F = 5.94 ) , and coping with stress ( P = 0.003 ; F = 8.85 ) and depression ( P = 0.036 ; F = 4.46 ) .",3
The program showed promise for promoting cardiovascular risk reduction behaviors .,4
These results are consistent with similar Web-based interventions .,4
"Out of 206 cirrhotics , 124 ( 60.19 % ) had MHE .",3
"Among these 124 MHE patients , 87 ( 70.16 % ) patients had CFF < 39Hz , 112 ( 90.32 % ) patients with MHE had two or more abnormal NPTs , and 75 ( 60.48 % ) patients had abnormality on both the CFF values and more than two abnormal NPTs .",3
"Intention-to-treat analysis showed the number of patients who improved after giving treatment were 67.7 % ( 21/31 ) , 70.9 % ( 22/31 ) , 50 % ( 16/32 ) , and 30 % ( 9/30 ) for LOLA , rifaximin , probiotics , and placebo , respectively .",3
"CFF scores and improvement in psychometric tests after treatment were significantly higher ( P < 0.05 ) for LOLA , rifaximin , and probiotics as compared with placebo group .",3
Prevalence of MHE is high in patients with cirrhosis of liver .,4
"Rifaximin , LOLA , and probiotics are better than giving placebo in patients with MHE .",4
"Compared to placebo , melatonin did not reduce plasma levels of any of pro- and anti-inflammatory markers and it also failed to influence levels of AA , DHA and MDA .",3
Melatonin has no beneficial effect on inflammation and oxidative damage induced by nighttime endotoxaemia in contrast to daytime endotoxaemia .,4
"Of 172 patients screened , 155 entered randomisation , 77 were assigned to receive ledipasvir-sofosbuvir plus ribavirin and 78 ledipasvir-sofosbuvir .",3
"114 ( 74 % ) were men , 151 ( 97 % ) , were white , 98 ( 63 % ) had HCV genotype 1a , and 145 ( 94 % ) had non-CC IL28B alleles .",3
SVR12 rates were 96 % ( 95 % CI 89-99 ) for patients in the ledipasvir-sofosbuvir plus ribavirin group and 97 % ( 91-100 ) in the ledipasvir-sofosbuvir group .,3
One patient discontinued treatment because of adverse events while receiving only placebo .,3
"The most frequent adverse events were asthenia and headache , pruritus , and fatigue .",3
Ledipasvir-sofosbuvir plus ribavirin for 12 weeks and ledipasvir-sofosbuvir for 24 weeks provided similarly high SVR12 rates in previous non-responders with HCV genotype 1 and compensated cirrhosis .,4
"The shorter regimen , when given with ribavirin , might , therefore , be useful to treat treatment-experienced patients with cirrhosis if longer-term treatment is not possible .",4
The Climate Schools program was shown to increase knowledge of cannabis and psychostimulants and decrease pro-drug attitudes .,3
"In the short-term the program was effective in subduing the uptake and plateauing the frequency of ecstasy use , however there were no changes in meth/amphetamine use .",3
"In addition , females who received the program used cannabis significantly less frequently than students who received drug education as usual .",3
"Finally , the Climate Schools program was related to decreasing students ' intentions to use meth/amphetamine and ecstasy in the future , however these effects did not last over time .",3
These findings provide support for the use of a harm-minimisation approach and computer technology as an innovative platform for the delivery of prevention education for illicit drugs in schools .,4
"The current study indicated that teachers and students enjoyed the program and that it is feasible to extend the successful Climate Schools model to the prevention of other drugs , namely cannabis and psychostimulants .",4
Three patients in the lithium group ( n = 8 ) and two patients in the placebo group ( n = 11 ) presented a suicide attempt throughout the course of the study .,3
No differences related to suicidal behavior could be detected between the placebo group and the group with lithium intervention .,3
"On the basis of the small sample size , among patients with comorbid PD , lithium does not seem to have an effect on suicidal behavior in contrast to patients with affective disorders without comorbid PD .",4
This protocol describes the implementation of a trial testing the effectiveness of an online resource designed to assist rural Australians to become more physically active .,4
"The outcomes of this study will guide the efforts of health promotion professionals by providing evidence for a relatively inexpensive , widely accessible and effective method for increasing physical activity that can be utilized by anyone with access to the internet .",4
Findings may indicate future directions for the implementation of physical activity and other health related interventions in rural communities .,4
"Effective rates of chlortetracycline group , chlortetracycline + clobetasol group and clobetasol groups were 86.1 % ( 62/72 ) , 87.9 % ( 58/66 ) , and 62.5 % ( 35/56 ) , respectively .",3
"There was a significant difference among these three groups ( Hc = 10.7766 , p = 0.0046 ) , the curative rate of clobetasol group was markedly lower than that of the former two groups ( p = 0.0072 and p = 0.0019 ) , but was not statistical significant ( p = 0.6077 ) when compared between the former groups .",3
"The occurrence of vulvar non-neoplastic epithelial disorders may be associated with chlamydia and mycoplasma infection , the chlortetracycline is an effective drug for this illness , the mechanism of which might be related to killing pathogens directly and inhibiting inflammatory mediators .",4
"Of the 3,240 patients , 2,084 ( 64.3 % ) met criteria for problematic drug use ( Drug Abuse Screening Test score 3 ) .",3
"Age greater than or equal to 30 years , tobacco smoking , daily or binge alcohol drinking , daily drug use , primary noncannabis drug use , resource-intense ED triage level , and perceived drug-relatedness of ED visit were highly correlated with problematic drug use .",3
"Among primary cannabis users , correlates of problematic drug use were age younger than 30 years , tobacco smoking , binge drinking , daily drug use , and perceived relatedness of the ED visit to drug use .",3
"Clinical correlates of drug use problems may assist the identification of ED patients who would benefit from comprehensive screening , intervention , and referral to treatment .",4
A clinical decision rule is proposed .,4
The correlation between problematic drug use and resource-intense ED triage levels suggests that ED-based efforts to reduce the unmet need for substance use treatment may help decrease overall health care costs .,4
"At 2 , 4 and 8 weeks , RO had healed in 68 % , 65 % and 61 % of patients unhealed at previous endoscopy , respectively .",3
Low-grade [ vs. high-grade ( C or D ) ] RO was the only independent predictor of rapid healing in group A after logistic regression analysis .,3
"Significantly more rapid healers had low grade RO ( A or B ) at baseline than patients with refractory RO ( 84 % vs. 49 % ; P < 0.001 ) , and significantly more refractory patients had frequent regurgitation at baseline than slow healers ( 80 % vs. 63 % ; P = 0.039 ) .",3
Low - ( vs. high - ) grade RO determines the most rapid benefit from acid suppression .,4
Roughly two-thirds of patients healed with each time increment of potent acid suppression therapy .,4
This suggests that some unhealed patients may still heal with continued therapy and that truly refractory RO is rare .,4
( ClinicalTrials.gov : NCT00206245 ) .,4
"Compared with dobutamine group , after the treatment in the levosimendan group , stroke volume index ( SVI ) , cardiac index ( CI ) and left ventricular stroke work index ( LVSWI ) were significantly increased [ SVI ( mL/m ) : 39.8 5.4 vs. 37.5 4.5 , t = -2.762 , P = 0.020 ; CI ( L min m ) : 4.6 0.7 vs. 3.6 0.7 , t = -9.829 , P = 0.000 ; LVSWI ( kg min m ) : 33.7 2.4 vs. 28.2 1.2 , t = -6.307 , P = 0.000 ] , and central venous pressure ( CVP ) , intrathoracic blood volume index ( ITBVI ) and extravascular lung water index ( EVLWI ) were significantly decreased [ CVP ( mmHg , 1 mmHg = 0.133 kPa ) : 8.2 0.9 vs. 12.1 0.8 , t = 3.928 , P = 0.002 ; ITBVI ( mL/m ) : 820 42 vs. 978 69 , t = 9.472 , P = 0.000 ; EVLWI ( mL/kg ) : 6.1 1.6 vs. 8.9 1.7 , t = 4.467 , P = 0.001 ] .",3
"Cardiac ultrasound showed that compared with dobutamine group , in the levosimendan group , left ventricular end-systolic volume ( LVESI ) and end-diastolic volume ( LVEDI ) were significantly lowered [ LVESI ( mL/m ) : 32.7 9.2 vs. 48.2 13.4 , t = 0.882 , P = 0.000 ; LVEDI ( mL/m ) : 61.7 11.4 vs. 78.6 13.6 , t = 2.453 , P = 0.032 ] , and the LVEF was significantly increased ( 0.463 0.068 vs. 0.383 .085 , t = -2.439 , P = 0.035 ) .",3
"Levosimendan also could decrease the lactic acid ( mmol/L : 3.4 1.1 vs. 5.2 1.2 , t = 3.346 , P = 0.007 ) , and increase the lactate clearance rate ( mL/min : 73.2 13.5 vs. 47.6 11.8 , t = -4.079 , P = 0.002 ) , 24-hour urinary output ( mL : 2 213.4 354.0 vs. 1 533.8 402.0 , t = 6.342 , P = 0.000 ) and 24-hour cumulative intake ( mL : 5 746.6 420.0 vs. 4 156.7 215.0 , t = 7.126 , P = 0.000 ) .",3
"There were no significant differences in total volume of norepinephrine , mortality in intensive care unit ( ICU ) and 28-day mortality between two groups .",3
"Levosimendan can increase cardiac ejection function , reduce the heart blood and vascular preload , intrathoracic lung water , improve heart function and systemic hemodynamic indexes of patients with septic shock .",4
An increased SPARC expression ( IRS 6 ) was observed in 26 % of all tumors .,3
"In triple-negative tumors , SPARC expression was increased in 37 % of tumors , compared with other molecular subtypes ( 23 % HR + / HER2 - , 29 % HR + / HER2 + and 22 % HR - / HER2 + ; P = 0.038 ) .",3
"Increased SPARC expression was associated with an increased pathological complete response ( pCR ) rate of 27 % , compared with 15 % in tumors with low SPARC expression ( P < 0.001 ) .",3
"In the triple-negative subgroup , pCR rates were 47 % in tumors with high SPARC expression , compared with 26 % in tumors with low SPARC expression ( P = 0.032 ) .",3
"In multivariable analysis , SPARC was independently predictive in the overall population ( P = 0.010 ) as well as the triple-negative subgroup ( P = 0.036 ) .",3
SPARC is frequently expressed in breast cancer with triple-negative breast cancer revealing the highest expression rate .,4
High SPARC expression of the primary tumor is associated with a higher chance of achieving a pathological complete remission after TAC or TAC-NX chemotherapy .,4
"As SPARC is an albumin-binding protein and might mediate intratumoral accumulation of albumin bound drugs , SPARC should be further evaluated as a predictive marker especially for response to albumin-bound drugs like nab-paclitaxel .",4
"At week 12 , proportions of patients with a PGA 20 % above baseline or with a PtGA improvement greater than or equal to the minimum clinically important difference were higher in the epratuzumab arms than the placebo arm .",3
PGA and PtGA improvements were sustained but did not reach statistical significance .,3
"At week 24 , mean cumulative corticosteroid doses with epratuzumab 360 and 720 mg/m ( 2 ) were 1051 and 1973 mg less than placebo ( P = 0.034 and 0.081 , respectively ) .",3
"At week 48 , SF-36 scores approached or exceeded US age - and gender-matched norms in five domains with the 360 mg/m ( 2 ) treatment .",3
Improvements were maintained in SL0006 over 2 years .,3
"Epratuzumab treatment produced clinically meaningful and sustained improvements in PGA , PtGA and HRQOL and reductions in corticosteroid doses .",4
"A 4-cluster solution showed good statistical quality criteria , even after split-half cross-validation .",3
`` Elderly patients adapted to pain '' ( cluster 1 ) and `` younger patients with acute pain '' ( cluster 4 ) accounted for 55 % of all patients .,3
Cluster validation showed the lowest direct and indirect costs in these groups .,3
About 72 % of total costs per patient referred to clusters 2 and 3 ( `` patients with chronic severe pain with comorbid depression '' and `` younger patients with subacute pain and emotional distress '' ) .,3
Our study adds substantially to the knowledge of LBP-related case-mix in primary care .,4
"Information on differential health care needs may be inferred from our study , enabling decision makers to allocate resources more appropriately and to reduce costs .",4
We found a significant increase in the EHS and IIEF-EF Domain scores from visit 1 to follow up 5 ( 12 months ) in the treated group compared to the placebo group .,3
By 1 month after treatment there were highly significant differences between the LI-ESWT and placebo groups ( p < 0.0001 ) .,3
"Out of 60 men in the LI-ESWT group who completed the study , 47 ( 78 % ) men at FU1 and 43 ( 71 % ) at FU5 who were initially unable to achieve spontaneous erections hard enough for penetration ( EHS 2 ) were able to do so ( EHS 3 ) compared to none in the placebo group .",3
The treatment was well tolerated and none of the men experienced treatment related discomfort or reported any adverse effects from the treatment .,3
"In this double-blind , placebo-controlled study , LI-ESWT demonstrated a positive long term clinical effect with improvement in erectile function of Indian men with vasculogenic ED who were prior responders to PDE5i therapy .",4
"The efficacy and tolerability of this treatment , coupled with its long term benefits and rehabilitative characteristics , make it an attractive new therapeutic option for men with vasculogenic erectile dysfunction .",4
Interobserver agreement for pulmonary artery and vein assessment was substantial or almost perfect ( = 0.72-0 .86 ) .,3
"For pulmonary arterial and venous variation assessment , there were no significant differences in sensitivity , specificity , and accuracy among non-contrast-enhanced MRA ( pulmonary arteries : sensitivity , 77.1 % ; specificity , 97.4 % ; accuracy , 87.7 % ; pulmonary veins : sensitivity , 50 % ; specificity , 98.5 % ; accuracy , 93.2 % ) , 4D contrast-enhanced MRA ( pulmonary arteries : sensitivity , 77.1 % ; specificity , 97.4 % ; accuracy , 87.7 % ; pulmonary veins : sensitivity , 62.5 % ; specificity , 100.0 % ; accuracy , 95.9 % ) , and thin-section contrast-enhanced MDCT ( pulmonary arteries : sensitivity , 91.4 % ; specificity , 89.5 % ; accuracy , 90.4 % ; pulmonary veins : sensitivity , 50 % ; specificity , 100.0 % ; accuracy , 95.9 % ) ( p > 0.05 ) .",3
Pulmonary vascular assessment of patients with NSCLC before surgical resection by non-contrast-enhanced MRA can be considered equivalent to that by 4D contrast-enhanced MRA and contrast-enhanced MDCT .,4
"Between April 30 , 2003 , and May 25 , 2010 , 228 patients were randomly assigned to receive doxorubicin and 227 to receive doxorubicin and ifosfamide .",3
Median follow-up was 56 months ( IQR 31-77 ) in the doxorubicin only group and 59 months ( 36-72 ) in the combination group .,3
There was no significant difference in overall survival between groups ( median overall survival 128 months [ 955 % CI 105-143 ] in the doxorubicin group vs 143 months [ 125-165 ] in the doxorubicin and ifosfamide group ; hazard ratio [ HR ] 083 [ 955 % CI 067-103 ] ; stratified log-rank test p = 0076 ) .,3
"Median progression-free survival was significantly higher for the doxorubicin and ifosfamide group ( 74 months [ 95 % CI 66-83 ] ) than for the doxorubicin group ( 46 months [ 29-56 ] ; HR 074 [ 95 % CI 060-090 ] , stratified log-rank test p = 0003 ) .",3
More patients in the doxorubicin and ifosfamide group than in the doxorubicin group had an overall response ( 60 [ 26 % ] of 227 patients vs 31 [ 14 % ] of 228 ; p < 00006 ) .,3
"The most common grade 3 and 4 toxic effects-which were all more common with doxorubicin and ifosfamide than with doxorubicin alone-were leucopenia ( 97 [ 43 % ] of 224 patients vs 40 [ 18 % ] of 223 patients ) , neutropenia ( 93 [ 42 % ] vs 83 [ 37 % ] ) , febrile neutropenia ( 103 ( 46 % ) vs 30 [ 13 % ] ) , anaemia ( 78 [ 35 % ] vs 10 [ 5 % ] ) , and thrombocytopenia ( 75 [ 33 % ] ) vs one [ < 1 % ] ) .",3
Our results do not support the use of intensified doxorubicin and ifosfamide for palliation of advanced soft-tissue sarcoma unless the specific goal is tumour shrinkage .,4
These findings should help individualise the care of patients with this disease .,4
"With the linagliptin 2.5 mg/metformin 850 mg dose , the adjusted geometric mean ratio of the SPC to the separate tablets for linagliptin was 99.53 % ( 90 % confidence interval ( CI ) : 94.75-104 .55 ) for AUC0-72 and 101.93 % ( 90 % CI : 95.36-108 .95 ) for Cmax ; for metformin the ratio was 96.99 % ( 90 % CI : 90.62-103 .81 ) for AUC0-tz and 94.64 % ( 90 % CI : 85.43-104 .84 ) for Cmax .",3
"With the linagliptin 2.5 mg/metformin 500 mg dose , the ratio with linagliptin for AUC0-72 and Cmax was 100.81 % ( 90 % CI : 95.14-106 .82 ) and 111.37 % ( 90 % CI : 100.40-123 .54 ) , respectively ; the same statistical parameters with metformin for AUC0-tz and Cmax were 102.95 % ( 90 % CI : 96.24-110 .12 ) and 102.46 % ( 90 % CI : 92.20-113 .87 ) , respectively .",3
SPC tablets of linagliptin and metformin were bioequivalent to separate tablets co-administered in healthy Chinese subjects .,4
Mean age was 60.4 years and median follow-up was 5.6 years .,3
"By design , modifiable risk factors were managed equally well in both treatment arms and only differed modestly between race/ethnic groups .",3
"HbA ( 1c ) decreased significantly from baseline with intensive glucose treatment in each race/ethnic group , with a trend for a greater response in Hispanics ( P = 0.02 for overall comparison between groups ) .",3
Intensive glucose treatment was associated with reduced risk of CVD events for Hispanics but not for others ( hazard ratios ranged from 0.54 to 0.75 for Hispanics whereas they were consistently close to 1 for others ) .,3
Sensitivity analyses with different definitions of race/ethnicity or limited to individuals free of previous known CVD yielded similar results .,3
The results of these analyses support the hypothesis that race/ethnicity is worthy of consideration when tailoring intensive treatment for individuals with long-standing type 2 diabetes .,4
"However , additional studies are needed to confirm the findings of this post-hoc analysis .",4
Outcomes were similar across groups at baseline .,3
"Final analysis included 20 physicians from seven clinics and 1,832 patients in the intervention arm ( 15 % loss to follow up ) and 29 physicians from seven clinics and 2,223 patients in the usual feedback arm ( 10 % loss to follow up ) .",3
Ten of 20 physicians completed the worksheet at least once during the study .,3
"Mean BP was 128/72 in the feedback plus worksheet arm and 128/73 in the feedback alone arm , while LDL was 2.1 and 2.0 , respectively .",3
"Thus , no significant differences were observed across groups in the primary outcomes , but mean haemoglobin A1c was lower in the feedback plus worksheet arm ( 7.2 % versus 7.4 % , p < 0.001 ) .",3
Improvements in both arms were noted over time for one-half of the process outcomes .,3
Appending a theory-informed goal setting and action planning worksheet to an externally produced audit and feedback intervention did not lead to improvements in patient outcomes .,4
The results may be explained in part by passive dissemination of the worksheet leading to inadequate engagement with the intervention .,4
"Nonlinear blended images at a 25 % reduced dose allowed a significant improvement in CNR ( p < 0.05 for all comparisons ) , compared with simulated 120-kVp linear blended images at a full dose .",3
No statistically significant difference existed in CNR and noise between the nonlinear blended images at a 50 % reduced dose and the simulated 120-kVp linear blended images at a full dose .,3
Nonlinear blended images at a 50 % reduced dose were considered in all cases to have acceptable image quality .,3
The dual-energy nonlinear image blending technique allows reducing the dose of contrast medium up to 50 % during portal venous phase imaging of the abdomen while preserving image quality .,4
"Systemic vascular resistance ( SVR ) post-resection and stroke volume of D vs S were 835.04 12.02 vs 778.16 11.97 dyn.sec.cm ( -5 ) , P < 0.01 , and 85.72 2.95 vs 76.16 6.52 ml , P < 0.01 respectively .",3
Doppler corrected flow time ( FTc ) between groups were comparable ( P > 0.05 ) .,3
"No difference post-operatively regarding hepatic and renal functions , and urine Microalb ( 14.76 3.95 vs l4 .24 8.65 g/ml , P = 0.78 ) , but a statistically difference was found with GST ( 0.046 [ symbols : see text ] , vs 0.043 [ symbols : see text ] IU/ml , P < 0.01 ) .",3
"Despite a higher D consumption ( 73 17 vs 64 22 ml , P = 0.102 ) , cost in Egyptian pounds ( LE ) was lower with D ( 141.14 32.90 vs 320.60 114.01 , LE , P < 0.01 ) .",3
"Extubation time and ICU stay with D vS ( 4.52 2 vs 7.72 2 min , P < 0.01 ) and ( 1.40 0.50 vs 1.64 0.48 , days P = 0.09 ) respectively .",3
"Neither D nor S were clinically superior to the other with respect to liver and kidneys functions , but D was found to preserve better the haemodynamic parameters and enhance recovery at a lower cost .",4
"24 hours preceding randomization , there were no differences in mean urine output or total output ; 24 hours post-randomization , the control group had higher mean urine output ( 4.2 2.6 ml/kg per h vs. 2.8 2.0 ml/kg per h , p = 0.02 ) but lower total output ( 6.3 2.1 ml/kg per h vs. 4.7 2.7 ml/kg per h , p = 0.01 ) .",3
Median biomarker concentrations did not differ significantly between groups at any time point .,3
Our results suggest renal replacement therapy does not change the time course of kidney function recovery .,4
Dietary intervention had no obvious effect on long-term gastrointestinal symptoms or HRQOL .,3
"The intervention group markedly reduced their dietary fiber and lactose intake during radiotherapy , but adherence tended to decline over time .",3
"The vast majority of long-term gastrointestinal symptoms were reported as ' a little ' , with a noticeable difference from pre-treatment only for unintentional stool leakage , limitations on daily activities , and mucus discharge .",3
"Long-term gastrointestinal symptoms were predominantly mild , and dietary intervention was not superior to a usual diet in preventing these symptoms .",4
"This approach will enable rigorous examination of the impact of the dietary intervention on early embryo development , together with the influence of the peri-implantation intra-uterine nutritional environment .",4
All the recruited patients completed the study .,3
Baseline characteristics were similar between the two groups .,3
"Frequency and severity of migraine attacks , nausea , the need for rescue treatment , and work absence rate decreased similarly in both groups .",3
Recovery from headache and ability to continue daily activities 2 hours after medical treatment showed similar improvement in both groups ( p > 0.05 ) .,3
Classic acupuncture and YNSA are similarly effective in the prophylaxis and treatment of migraine headache and may be considered as alternatives to pharmacotherapy .,4
This study will provide significant evidence for using a new method ( TEAS ) in IVF .,4
The KIM-CHI group showed statistically significant increases in mammography uptake compared to the attention control group at 6 months and 15 months postintervention .,3
The culturally targeted KIM-CHI program was effective in increasing mammogram uptake among nonadherent KA women .,4
Nurses and healthcare providers should consider specific health beliefs as well as inclusion of husbands or significant others .,4
They also should target education to be culturally relevant for KA women to effectively improve frequency of breast cancer screening .,4
A total of 260 patients underwent single-level arthroplasty or arthodesis .,3
"Preoperatively , 52 % reported NDI headache scores of 3 or greater , compared with only 13 % -17 % postoperatively .",3
"The model-based mean NDI headache score at baseline was 2.5 ( 95 % CI 2.3-2 .7 ) and was reduced by 1.3 points after surgery ( 95 % CI 1.2-1 .4 , p < 0.001 ) .",3
"Higher cervical levels were associated with a greater degree of preoperative headache , but there was no association with headache relief .",3
There was no significant difference in headache relief between arthroplasty and arthrodesis .,3
Most patients with symptomatic cervical spondylosis have headache as a preoperative symptom ( 88 % ) .,4
Anterior cervical discectomy with both arthroplasty and arthrodesis is associated with a durable decrease in headache .,4
Headache relief is not related to the level of operation .,4
The mechanism for headache reduction remains unclear .,4
"This study will be the first to use clinical assessment to examine the voice quality of very preterm children , and to use fibre optic endoscopic evaluation of laryngeal function to determine the nature and extent of any laryngeal pathology in such children .",4
Those participants with significant voice difficulties will be randomised to receive treatment immediately or after the eight week assessment .,4
"Of the 5364 condoms used during intercourse by 272 women , 200 clinical failures occurred in 195 condoms ( 190 condoms had one failure , and 5 had two failures ) .",3
Total clinical failure was comparable across FC types .,3
"Of the 195 condoms in which failures occurred , the number of failures in the first condom use period was 103 ( 7.7 % ) , decreasing to 43 events ( 3.2 % ) in the second , 33 ( 2.5 % ) in the third and 16 ( 1.2 % ) in the fourth .",3
"Only 2 failures were reported in the 20th use of an FC compared to 29 in the first use , irrespective of condom type .",3
FC failure rates decreased markedly after use of the first five condoms regardless of FC type and continued to fall across the next three use periods .,4

"Patients who met clinical criteria for dose reduction at randomisation ( n = 5356 ) had higher rates of stroke , bleeding , and death compared with those who did not have a dose reduction ( n = 15749 ) .",3
"Edoxaban dose ranged from 15 mg to 60 mg , resulting in a two-fold to three fold gradient of mean trough drug exposure ( 160-485 ng/mL in 6780 patients with data available ) and mean trough anti-FXa activity ( 035-085 IU/mL in 2865 patients ) .",3
"Dose reduction decreased mean exposure by 29 % ( from 485 ng/mL [ SD 458 ] to 346 ng/mL [ 309 ] ) and 35 % ( from 245 ng/mL [ 227 ] to 160 ng/mL [ 145 ] ) and mean anti-FXa activity by 25 % ( from 085 IU/mL [ 076 ] to 064 IU/mL [ 054 ] ) and 20 % ( from 044 IU/mL [ 037 ] to 035 IU/mL [ 028 ] ) in the higher-dose and lower-dose regimens , respectively .",3
"Despite the lower anti-FXa activity , dose reduction preserved the efficacy of edoxaban compared with warfarin ( stroke or systemic embolic event : higher dose pinteraction = 085 , lower dose pinteraction = 099 ) and provided even greater safety ( major bleeding : higher dose pinteraction 002 , lower dose pinteraction = 0002 ) .",3
These findings validate the strategy that tailoring of the dose of edoxaban on the basis of clinical factors alone achieves the dual goal of preventing excess drug concentrations and helps to optimise an individual patient 's risk of ischaemic and bleeding events and show that the therapeutic window for edoxaban is narrower for major bleeding than thromboembolism .,4

"Over 4.8 years of follow-up , metabolic syndrome developed in 960 ( 50.0 % ) of the 1919 participants who did not have the condition at baseline .",3
"The risk of developing metabolic syndrome did not differ between participants assigned to the control diet and those assigned to either of the Mediterranean diets ( control v. olive oil HR 1.10 , 95 % CI 0.94-1 .30 , p = 0.231 ; control v. nuts HR 1.08 , 95 % CI 0.92-1 .27 , p = 0.3 ) .",3
Reversion occurred in 958 ( 28.2 % ) of the 3392 participants who had metabolic syndrome at baseline .,3
"Compared with the control group , participants on either Mediterranean diet were more likely to undergo reversion ( control v. olive oil HR 1.35 , 95 % CI 1.15-1 .58 , p < 0.001 ; control v. nuts HR 1.28 , 95 % CI 1.08-1 .51 , p < 0.001 ) .",3
Participants in the group receiving olive oil supplementation showed significant decreases in both central obesity and high fasting glucose ( p = 0.02 ) ; participants in the group supplemented with nuts showed a significant decrease in central obesity .,3
"A Mediterranean diet supplemented with either extra virgin olive oil or nuts is not associated with the onset of metabolic syndrome , but such diets are more likely to cause reversion of the condition .",4
An energy-unrestricted Mediterranean diet may be useful in reducing the risks of central obesity and hyperglycemia in people at high risk of cardiovascular disease .,4
"Fifteen patients were randomized in each treatment arm , and 2 patients dropped out in both treatment arms .",3
"After therapy , both therapies resulted in a significant decrease in mean TCS ( 51.4 % [ 95 % CI , 39.7 % to 63.0 % ] for clobetasol ointment [ P < .001 ] and 35.6 % [ 95 % CI , 18.2 % to 53.1 % ] for UV-A1 phototherapy [ P = .006 ] ) .",3
No significant difference was found between both treatments ( P > .05 ) .,3
"The Skindex-29 ( mean difference [ MD ] , 29.6 [ 95 % CI , 7.9 to 51.2 ] [ P = .009 ] ) and the VAS score for pruritus ( MD , 4.6 [ 95 % CI , 1.5 to 7.7 ] [ P = .005 ] ) and burning and/or pain ( MD , 4.2 [ 95 % CI , 1.9 to 6.6 ] [ P = .001 ] ) significantly decreased after clobetasol treatment .",3
"After UV-A1 phototherapy , the VAS score for burning and/or pain ( MD , 3.2 [ 95 % CI , 0.7 to 5.7 ] [ P = .01 ] ) was also significantly reduced ; however , there was no significant reduction in pruritus ( MD , 2.1 [ 95 % CI , 0.5 to 3.7 ] [ P = .16 ] ) and in the Skindex-29 score ( MD , 4.9 [ 95 % CI , -12.6 to 22.4 ] [ P > .99 ] ) .",3
A significant reduction of the corium thickness and a significant increase in dermal density in 20-MHz ultrasonography as well as significant histopathological reduction of the inflammatory infiltrate was observed after clobetasol treatment but not after UV-A1 phototherapy .,3
"Although resulting in a significant clinical improvement , UV-A1 phototherapy was inferior to the current gold standard treatment with topical high-potent corticosteroids with respect to practicability , relief of itch , and improvement in quality of life .",4
UV-A1 phototherapy may be considered a potential second-line treatment for VLS .,4
The addition of JCPs to TAU had no significant effect on compulsory admissions or total societal cost per participant over 18-months follow-up .,3
"From the service cost perspective , however , evidence suggests a higher probability ( 80 % ) of JCPs being the more cost-effective option .",3
Exploration by ethnic group highlights distinct patterns of costs and effects .,3
"Whilst the evidence does not support the cost-effectiveness of JCPs for White or Asian ethnic groups , there is at least a 90 % probability of the JCP intervention being the more cost-effective option in the Black ethnic group .",3
The results by ethnic group are sufficiently striking to warrant further investigation into the potential for patient gain from JCPs among black patient groups .,4
PSA velocity improved discrimination at 4 years in the dutasteride group but not at 2 years nor in the placebo group .,3
"At 2 years , dutasteride improved discrimination of PSA slightly ( 0.616 vs. 0.603 for any grade cancer ; 0.681 vs. 0.676 for high-grade disease ) .",3
Between-group differences in cancer rates at 4 years were small .,3
Clinicians who are willing to treat at least 23 patients with dutasteride for 2 years to avoid 1 prostate cancer diagnosis should offer dutasteride after initial negative biopsy .,4
"Clinicians not willing to do so might consider dutasteride for its additional benefit of reducing unnecessary biopsy , although this benefit is apparent only under very restrictive conditions .",4
It is difficult to justify extending treatment with dutasteride for > 2 years .,4
"Wound healing time until complete skin epithelialisation was shorter in the NPWT ( n = 9 ) compared to the alginate group ( n = 7 ) , median 57 and 104 days , respectively ( p = 0.026 ) .",3
No difference was recorded in QoL and pain between the groups at study start and the second assessment .,3
"QoL analysis within groups between time points , showed that patients in NPWT groups improved in EQ-5D domains , ` self-care ' ( p = 0.034 ) , ` usual activities ' ( p = 0.046 ) ; EQ-5D index value ( p = 0.046 ) and EQ-VAS ( p = 0.028 ) .",3
Patients in the NPWT group reported significantly less pain ` affecting their relations with other people ' and ` sleep ' between time points .,3
The NPWT group had significantly fewer dressing changes compared to the alginate group ( p < 0.001 ) .,3
"The median frequency of wound dressing changes outside hospital was 20 ( IQR 6-29 ) in the NPWT group ( n = 9 ) , compared to 48 ( IQR 42-77 ) in the alginate group ( n = 8 ; p = 0.004 ) .",3
"The saved personnel time for wound care in the first week for the NPWT group , compared with the alginate group , was 4.5 hours per week per nurse .",3
The total hospitalised care cost was 83-87 % of the total cost in both groups .,3
NPWT therapy in patients with deep peri-vascular groin infection can be regarded as the dominant strategy due to improved clinical outcome with equal cost and quality of life measures .,4
MAT-Fel d 1 vaccine was efficiently internalized by antigen-presenting cells .,3
"This was followed by precaspase 1 cleavage to caspase 1 and secretion of IL-1 , indicating inflammasome activation .",3
Mat-Fel d 1 induced specific T-cell proliferation and an IL-10 - and IFN -- dominated T-cell responses with decreased Th2 cytokines at 100 times lower doses than Fel d 1 .,3
Induction of immune tolerance by MAT-Fel d 1-ILIT involved multiple mechanisms of immune suppression .,3
"Early Fel d 1-specific T-cell activation was followed by full T-cell unresponsiveness to allergen after 1year in the MAT-Fel d 1 group , characterized by increased allergen-specific T regulatory cells , decreased circulating Fel d 1 tetramer-positive cells , increased IL-10 and FOXP3 expression , and change in the HR2/HR1 ratio toward HR2 .",3
"This study demonstrates the induction of allergen tolerance after 3 intra-lymph node injections of MAT-Fel d 1 vaccine , mediated by increased cellular internalization of the allergen , activation of inflammasome , and generation of allergen-specific peripheral T-cell tolerance .",4
"The curative rate was 56.3 % ( 45/80 ) in the group A , which was better than 18.8 % ( 15/80 ) in the group B ( P < 0.01 ) .",3
"The total effective rate was 95.0 % ( 76/80 ) in the group A , which was better than 76.3 % ( 61/80 ) in the group B ( P < 0.01 ) .",3
"The scores of PRI , VAS and PPI after treatment were all improved significantly in the two groups ( all P < 0.05 ) , in which , the results in the group A were better than those in the group B ( PRI : 4.00 + / - 0.97 vs 5.44 + / - 1.16 , VAS : 3.29 + / - 0.72 vs 3.87 + / - 0.81 , PPI : 1.07 + / - 0.74 vs 1.64 + / - 0.90 , all P < 0.05 ) .",3
The combined therapy of electroacupuncture and manual manipulation achieves the superior efficacy on thoracic facet joint disorder as compared with the simple manual manipulation .,4
The combined therapy relieves the symptoms of thoracic facet joint disorder and reduces the severity of disorder .,4
Glucose and insulin responses and plasma concentrations of SCFAs to the meal test were similar between the WGR and BRB+WW periods .,3
"When compared to the WW period , postprandial insulin concentration at 120 min was lower ( p = 0.023 ) and the first-phase insulin secretion improved ( p = 0.033 ) only after the WGR period , whereas postprandial concentrations of butyrate ( p < 0.05 ) and propionate ( p = 0.009 ) at 30 min increased during both rye bread periods .",3
Beneficial effects of WGR over white wheat bread on glucose and SCFA production were confirmed .,4
The enrichment of the white wheat bread with bioprocessed rye bran ( BRB+WW ) yielded similar but not as pronounced effects than WGR when compared to WW alone .,4
Postprandially measured glucose metabolism and concentrations of SCFAs provided additional information along with fasting measurements .,4
"Median preoperative TnI and NT-ProBNP concentrations were 4.3 ng litre ( -1 ) and 144 pg ml ( -1 ) , respectively .",3
"After surgery , 67 ( 46 % ) patients in the intervention group and 68 ( 48 % ) patients receiving usual care had TnI concentrations above the 99th centile upper reference limit ( P = 0.82 ) .",3
"Peak serum TnI concentration was similar in the intervention and usual care groups ( median [ interquartile range ] : 10.0 [ 5.3-21 .5 ] vs 7.8 [ 5.0-21 .8 ] ng litre ( -1 ) ; P = 0.85 ) , and no differences were observed in serum TnI concentrations over 72 h ( repeated-measures anova , P = 0.51 ) .",3
"Likewise , there were no differences in peak NT-proBNP concentration between intervention and usual care groups ( 645 [ 362-1169 ] vs 659 [ 381-1028 ] pg ml ( -1 ) ; P = 0.86 ) or in serial NT-proBNP concentrations over 72 h ( P = 0.20 ) .",3
Myocardial injury is common among patients undergoing major gastrointestinal surgery .,4
"In this study , the frequency was not affected by cardiac output-guided fluid and low-dose inotropic therapy .",4
"Fewer sepsis episodes were observed in LF-treated infants ( 4.4 vs. 17.3 / 1,000 patient days , p = 0.007 ) with none developing NEC , without statistical significance .",3
"Treg levels at birth and discharge were similar , while preterm infants showed significantly lower levels than term controls .",3
"However , individual increases in Treg levels were higher in the LF group .",3
LF prophylaxis reduced nosocomial sepsis episodes .,4
Treg levels in preterm infants were lower than in term infants and an increase of Treg levels under LF prophylaxis was observed .,4
Increase in Treg levels can be the mechanism for protective effects of LF on nosocomial sepsis .,4
"Overall , there were no group differences in wound closure or time to wound healing at week 16 .",3
"However , in subjects with an albumin level of 40 g/l and/or an ankle-brachial index of < 1.0 , a significantly greater proportion of subjects in the arginine , glutamine and - hydroxy -- methylbutyrate group healed at week 16 compared with control subjects ( P = 0.03 and 0.008 , respectively ) .",3
Those with low albumin or decreased limb perfusion in the supplementation group were 1.70 ( 95 % CI 1.04-2 .79 ) and 1.66 ( 95 % CI 1.15-2 .38 ) times more likely to heal .,3
"While no differences in healing were identified with supplementation in non-ischaemic patients or those with normal albumin , addition of arginine , glutamine and - hydroxy -- methylbutyrate as an adjunct to standard of care may improve healing of diabetic foot ulcers in patients with risk of poor limb perfusion and/or low albumin levels .",4
"Further investigation involving arginine , glutamine and - hydroxy -- methylbutyrate in these high-risk subgroups might prove clinically valuable .",4
The total effective rate in treatment group at 3 months treatment and 3 months follow-up were higher than that in control group ( P < 0.05 ) .,3
The CM symptoms in treatment group were improved significantly ( P < 0.05 ) .,3

"In terms of feasibility outcomes , 90 ( 87 % ) of 104 eligible patients were approached for consent , and on average , 1.7 children were enrolled per month .",3
"Thirty-five ( 70 % ) were enrolled within 1 day of becoming eligible ( mean , 1.2 days ) .",3
"Thereafter , 94 % of doses were administered by protocol .",3
Clinical outcomes and adverse effects were not significantly different between the groups .,3
This pilot trial demonstrated feasibility of a larger randomized controlled trial .,4
"Some important challenges emerged , allowing refinement of the study protocol and enrolment estimates .",4
We recommend that future trials capitalize on the experience gained and use these results to design a larger trial focusing on clinically important outcomes .,4
The number of residents included was 1628 pre-intervention [ 825 IG/803 control group ( CG ) ] and 1610 post-intervention ( 838 IG/772 CG ) .,3
"The corresponding pre - and post-intervention point prevalence of systemic antibiotic prescribing for treatment of infection was 6.46 % and 6.52 % in the IG [ estimated prevalence ratio : 1.01 ( 95 % CI : 0.81-1 .25 ) , P = 0.94 ] compared with 5.27 % and 5.83 % , respectively , in the CG [ estimated prevalence ratio : 1.11 ( 95 % CI : 0.87-1 .41 ) , P = 0.4 ] .",3
"Total antibiotic consumption was 69.78 defined daily doses/1000 residents/day ( DRD ) pre-intervention and 66.53 DRD post-intervention in the IG compared with 49.68 and 51.92 DRD , respectively , in the CG .",3
There was a significant decrease of 4.9 % ( 3.25 DRD ) in the IG ( 95 % CI : 1.0 % -8.6 % ) ( P = 0.02 ) compared with a significant increase of 5.1 % ( 2.24 DRD ) in the CG ( 95 % CI : 0.2 % -10.2 % ) ( P = 0.04 ) .,3
"Main indications for antibiotics were lower respiratory tract infections ( 34.1 % ) , urinary tract infections ( 28.5 % ) and skin/soft tissue infections ( 25.1 % ) .",3

KRAS mutation was observed in one patient .,3
"A positive correlation between late effectors of mTORC1 activation , a positive correlation between Akt-independent mTORC1 activation , and an inverse correlation between canonical PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway and everolimus efficacy were observed in this exploratory analysis .",4
"However , these correlations need to be validated in larger studies before applying the findings to routine clinical practice .",4
Diabetic patients ' risk factors at baseline were balanced across treatments .,3
"For diabetic patients , the primary short-term composite outcome rate showed a worse trend for off-pump ( 8.0 % ) than on-pump ( 3.9 % , p = 0.013 ) , with no difference in the 1-year primary composite outcome or 1-year death rate .",3
One-year patency was 83.1 % off-pump versus 88.4 % on-pump ( p = 0.004 ) .,3
"No differences were found in neurocognitive , health-related quality of life , discharge cost , and 1-year cumulative cost .",3
"Concordant with the ROOBY trial 's overall findings , off-pump CABG yielded no advantage over on-pump CABG for actively treated diabetic patients .",4

"Participants in the lowest quartile had a hazards ratio for mortality of 0.80 ( 95 % CI , 0.54-1 .17 ) compared with those in the highest quartile of total urinary resveratrol in a multivariable Cox proportional hazards model that adjusted for potential confounders .",3
"Resveratrol levels were not significantly associated with serum CRP , IL-6 , IL-1 , TNF , prevalent or incident cardiovascular disease , or cancer .",3
"In older community-dwelling adults , total urinary resveratrol metabolite concentration was not associated with inflammatory markers , cardiovascular disease , or cancer or predictive of all-cause mortality .",4

"Fasting leptin was significantly decreased in both groups ( LoGIX : preintervention = 33.8 4.7 , postintervention = 19.2 4.5 ; HiGIX : preintervention = 27.9 4.2 , postintervention = 11.9 2.2 ngmL ; P = 0.004 ) , and HMW adiponectin was significantly increased ( LoGIX : preintervention = 1606.9 34.6 , postintervention = 3502.3 57 ; HiGIX : preintervention = 3704.8 38.1 , postintervention = 4284.3 52.8 pgmL ; P = 0.003 ) after the 12-wk intervention .",3
Total body fat was reduced after both interventions .,3
"Visceral fat mass was inversely correlated with HMW adiponectin , whereas subcutaneous fat correlated with leptin .",3
"The data suggest that exercise training , independent of dietary glycemic index , favorably alters HMW adiponectin and leptin secretion and that a reduction in visceral fat mass is a key factor regulating HMW adiponectin in older obese persons .",4
We sequentially allocated 60 patients to a dosing cohort ( 20 per dose group ) and randomized them to transendocardial MPC injections ( n = 15 ) or mock procedures ( n = 5 ) .,3
"The primary objective was safety , including antibody testing .",3
"Secondary efficacy end points included major adverse cardiac events ( MACE ; cardiac death , myocardial infarction , or revascularization ) , left ventricular imaging , and other clinical-event surrogates .",3

Data were obtained by medical record abstraction and patient interviews at baseline hospitalization and 1 and 12 months after AMI .,3
Health status was measured by generic ( Short Form-12 ) and disease-specific ( Seattle Angina Questionnaire ) measures .,3
"We compared health status scores at all 3 time points and used longitudinal linear mixed-effects analyses to examine the independent effect of gender , adjusting for time and selected covariates .",3
Women had significantly lower health status scores than men at each assessment ( all P values < 0.0001 ) .,3
"After adjustment for time and all covariates , women had Short Form-12 physical/mental summary scores that were -0.96 ( 95 % confidence interval [ CI ] , -1.59 to -0.32 ) and -2.36 points ( 95 % CI , -2.99 to -1.73 ) lower than those of men , as well as worse Seattle Angina Questionnaire physical limitations ( -2.44 points lower ; 95 % CI , -3.53 to -1.34 ) , more angina ( -1.03 points lower ; 95 % CI , -1.98 to -0.07 ) , and poorer quality of life ( -3.51 points lower ; 95 % CI , -4.80 to -2.22 ) .",3
"Although both genders recover similarly after AMI , women have poorer scores than men on all health status measures , a difference that persisted throughout the entire year after discharge .",4
"Among 24 eligible frail elderly , 12 agreed to participate and 3 drop out .",3
The adherence was 15 of 24 intervention sessions .,3
"For secondary outcome , effect sizes ( ES ) for SR-WBV intervention on SPPB , ETGUG and CR were determined .",3
This pilot study indicate that the training protocol used in this form for frail elderly individuals is feasible but with modification due to the fact that not all defined feasibility outcomes target was met .,4
"SR-WBV with 6Hz , noise level 4 shows benefit improvements on SPPB ( ES 0.52 ) , ETGUG ( part sit-to-stand movement : ES 0.81 ; total time : ES 0.85 ) and CR ( ES 0.66 ) .",4
Further research is desired to determine whether a new adapted training protocol is necessary for SR-WBV in the `` skilling up '' phase in frail elderly individuals .,4
The analysis included 310 patients randomly assigned to RM ( active group ) vs. ambulatory follow-ups ( control group ) .,3
"Patients in the active group were seen once a year unless the system reported an event mandating an ambulatory visit , while patients in the control group were seen in the ambulatory department every 6 months .",3
"The costs of each follow-up strategy were compared , using the actual billing documents issued by the French health insurance system , including costs of ( i ) ( a ) ICD-related ambulatory visits and transportation , ( b ) other ambulatory visits , ( c ) cardiovascular treatments and procedures , and ( ii ) hospitalizations for the management of cardiovascular events .",3
The ICD and RM system costs were calculated on the basis of the device remaining longevity at the end of the study .,3
The characteristics of the study groups were similar .,3
"Over a follow-up of 27 months , the mean non-hospital costs per patient-year were 1695 1131 in the active , vs. 1952 1023 in the control group ( P = 0.04 ) , a 257 difference mainly due to device management .",3
"The hospitalization costs per patient-year were 2829 6382 and 3549 9714 in the active and control groups , respectively ( P = 0.46 ) .",3
"Adding the ICD to the non-hospital costs , the savings were 494 ( P = 0.005 ) or , when the monitoring system was included , 315 ( P = 0.05 ) per patient-year .",3
"From the French health insurance perspective , the remote management of ICD patients is cost saving .",4
"Sixty-five patients were included , of whom 61 ( PRA 30 , LTLA 31 ) completed the 5-year follow-up .",3
"The following differences were identified in favor of PRA vs LTLA : shorter duration of surgery ( 50.8 vs 77.3 minutes ) , lower intraoperative blood loss ( 52.7 vs 97.8 mL ) , diminished pain intensity within 48 hours postoperatively , lower prevalence of shoulder-tip pain ( 3.0 % vs 37.5 % ) , shorter time to oral intake ( 4.4 vs 7.3 hours ) , shorter time to ambulation ( 6.1 vs 11.5 hours ) , shorter length of hospital stay , and lower cost ( 1728 vs 2315 ) , respectively ( P < 0.001 for all ) .",3
"No differences were noted in conversion rate or morbidity except for herniation occurring more often after LTLA than PRA ( 16.1 % vs 0 % , P = 0.022 ) and need for hernia repair ( 12.9 % vs 0 % , P = 0.050 ) , respectively .",3
Both approaches were equally safe .,4
"However , outcomes of PRA operations were superior to LTLA in terms of shorter surgery duration , lower blood loss , lower postoperative pain , faster recovery , improved cost-effectiveness , and abolished risk of surgical access site herniation .",4
The percentage of households with a latrine ( completed or under construction ) increased from 8 % at baseline to 66 % one year after the start of the intervention in March 2012 .,3
"Almost none of the intervention households recall any form of participatory community-level activities at the start of the programme , although intervention households were generally more aware of the Total Sanitation Campaign ( 91 % versus 49 % , p < 0.001 ) , VWSCs ( 51 % versus 9 % , p < 0.001 ) , adolescent girls groups ( 23 % versus 8 % , p < 0.01 ) , wall paintings ( 44 % versus 7 % , p < 0.001 ) and were more likely to report a household visit on sanitation during the past three months ( 65 % versus 3 % , p < 0.001 ) .",3
We found no strong evidence of an association between levels of awareness of or participation in mobilisation activities and levels of latrine coverage in intervention villages .,3
"The levels of coverage achieved and the levels of awareness of the mobilisation process in our intervention villages were lower than planned , but similar to those reported elsewhere in India under the TSC .",4
Our process evaluation highlights important gaps between the TSC guidelines and their implementation on the ground .,4
"Users of the FitBack program showed greater improvement compared to the control group in every comparison of the critical physical , behavioral , and worksite outcome measures at 4-month follow-up .",3
"In addition , users of the FitBack program performed better than the alternative care group on current back pain , behavioral , and worksite outcomes at 4-month follow-up .",3
"For example , subjects in the control group were 1.7 times more likely to report current back pain than subjects in the FitBack group ; subjects in the alternative care group were 1.6 times more likely to report current back pain at 4-month follow-up .",3
"Further , the users of the FitBack program showed greater improvement compared to both the control and alternative care groups at 4-month follow-up on patient activation , constructs of the Theory of Planned Behavior , and attitudes toward pain .",3
This research demonstrated that a theoretically based stand-alone mobile-Web intervention that tailors content to users ' preferences and interests can be an effective tool in self-management of low back pain .,4
"When viewed from the RE-AIM perspective ( ie , reach , efficacy/effectiveness , adoption , implementation fidelity , and maintenance ) , this study supports the notion that there is considerable value in this type of intervention as a potentially cost-effective tool that can reach large numbers of people .",4
"The results are promising considering that the FitBack intervention was neither supported by professional caregivers nor integrated within a health promotion campaign , which might have provided additional support for participants .",4
"Still , more research is needed on how self-guided mobile-Web interventions will be used over time and to understand factors associated with continuing user engagement .",4
There were 280 patients ( 62 % ) with < 3-h delay and 170 patients ( 38 % ) with 3-h delay .,3
"Patients with longer delay were significantly older , more often women , and diabetic .",3
"Earlier reperfusion was not associated with higher rates of final Thrombolysis In Myocardial Infarction flow grade 3 or myocardial blush grade 2/3 , but was an independent predictor of smaller IS ( p = 0.02 by multivariable linear regression ) .",3
"Mortality at 1 year was reduced in patients with shorter delay to reperfusion ( 4.0 % vs. 9.2 % , p = 0.02 ) .",3
"In patients with large anterior myocardial infarction undergoing relatively early reperfusion , longer delays to reperfusion were associated with larger IS and 1-year mortality , but notwith reduced reperfusion success .",4
( The INFUSE - Anterior Myocardial Infarction [ AMI ] Study ; NCT00976521 ) .,4
"Nine lean , healthy subjects [ 6 men and 3 women ; mean ( SD ) age : 22.7 3.0 y ; mean body mass index ( in kg/m ) : 21.8 1.8 ] were included in this study .",3
IHL concentrations increased 20 % ( P < 0.01 ) at 3 h after the meal and did not further increase after 5 h.,3
"In contrast , IMCL concentrations were not altered during the postprandial period ( P = 0.74 ) .",3
The addition of protein to a single high-fat meal did not change the postprandial accumulation of fat in the liver ( P = 0.93 ) or skeletal muscle ( P = 0.84 ) .,3
"In this study , we showed that a single energy-dense , high-fat meal induced net lipid accumulation in the liver , which was detected by using in vivo H-MRS .",4
This noninvasive approach might bring new opportunities to study postprandial hepatic lipid dynamics .,4
The addition of protein did not change the ectopic lipid retention after a single high-fat meal .,4
"The treatment groups did not differ in rates of repeated self-harm at 6-week , 6-month and 12-month follow-up .",3
Both treatment groups showed significant improvements in psychological and social functioning at follow-up .,3
Only one measure ( needing and receiving practical help from those closest to them ) showed a positive treatment effect at 6-week ( P = 0.004 ) and 6-month ( P = 0.01 ) follow-up .,3
Repetition was not associated with waiting time in the PST group .,3
This brief intervention for self-harm is no more effective than treatment as usual .,4
"Further work is required to establish whether a modified , more intensive programme delivered sooner after the index episode would be effective .",4
"It is seen that both patient groups ( tetraplegic and paraplegic ) have some significant differences in event-related desynchronization strengths , exhibit significant increases in synchronization and reach significantly lower accuracies ( mean ( M ) = 66.1 % ) than the group of healthy subjects ( M = 85.1 % ) .",3
The results demonstrate significant differences in electrophysiological correlates of motor control between healthy individuals and those individuals who stand to benefit most from BCI technology ( individuals with SCI ) .,4
"They highlight the difficulty in directly translating results from healthy subjects to participants with SCI and the challenges that , therefore , arise in providing BCIs to such individuals .",4
Satisfaction in the per-protocol population was significantly greater at Day 60 in the onabotulinumtoxinA group ( n = 60 ) compared with placebo ( n = 57 ) for GL ( 81.7 % vs 0 % ; p < .001 ) .,3
Most subjects treated with onabotulinumtoxinA remained satisfied up to 120 days .,3
"Achievement of treatment expectations ( 86.7 % ; Day 60 ) , satisfaction ( 81.7 % ; Day 60 ) , and satisfaction with the duration of treatment ( 61.6 % ; Day 90 ) were significantly better with onabotulinumtoxinA than placebo ( p < .001 ) for GL and CFL combined .",3
"Efficacy ( FWS ) and aesthetic improvement were observed in most subjects at Days 30 and 60 , respectively .",3
High satisfaction rates are achieved and sustained in subjects treated with onabotulinumtoxinA for GL and CFL combined .,4
Thirty nine girls ( 43.3 % ) and 51 boys ( 56.7 % ) with mean age of 3.341.47 y were assessed .,3
"Sufficient sedation and completion of EEG were achieved in 70 % ( N = 21 ) of chloral hydrate group , in 83.3 % ( N = 25 ) of CH + H group and in 96.7 % ( N = 29 ) of CH + P group ( p = 0.02 ) .",3
"Mild clinical adverse events including vomiting [ 16.7 % ( N = 5 ) in CH , 6.7 % ( N = 2 ) in CH + P , 6.7 % ( N = 2 ) in CH + H ] , agitation in 3.3 % of CH + P ( N = 1 ) group and mild transient hypotension in 3.3 % of CH + H ( N = 1 ) group occurred .",3
Safety of these three sedation regimens was not statistically significant different ( p = 0.14 ) .,3
Combination of chloral hydrate-antihistamines can be used as the most effective and safe sedation regimen in drug induced sleep electroencephalography of kids .,4
"MMSE and BI showed direct and indirect impact on EQ5D , but the association with NPI-sum severity was minor .",3
The identified model showed that R ( 2 ) of EQ5D varied from 0.21 to 0.48 .,3
This clinical-empirical study showed that SEM could be utilized to unravel and identify a model of complex direct and indirect effects of MMSE and BI on EQ5D .,4
"In relation to NPI-sum severity , however , the validity of EQ5D seemed insufficient in psychogeriatric patients .",4
"Consequently , the cost-benefit analyses and cost-effectiveness analyses using quality-adjusted life-year measures of an intervention in psychogeriatric patients with multiple neuropsychiatric symptoms , based on EQ5D , are considered questionable .",4
Construction of a quality of life instrument that is more sensitive with regard to multiple neuropsychiatric symptoms in psychogeriatric patients is highly recommended .,4
"The results of the intent-to-treat analyses suggested a global efficacy of MOTR , in the sense of an additional reduction of general problems , i.e. symptoms , interpersonal and social problems ( F1 , 73 = 7.25 , p < 0.05 ) .",3
"However , they also showed that MOTR did not yield an additional reduction of specific borderline symptoms .",3
"It was also shown that a stronger therapeutic alliance , as assessed by the therapist , developed in MOTR treatments compared to GPM ( Z55 = 0.99 , p < 0.04 ) .",3
These results suggest that adding MOTR to psychiatric and psychotherapeutic treatments of BPD is promising .,4
"Moreover , the findings shed additional light on the perspective of shortening treatments for patients presenting with BPD .",4
Hypotension was observed in 14 group 0 patients ( 39 % ) and in 15 group P patients ( 44 % ) ; the difference was not statistically significant .,3
Bradycardia was noted in 1 group 0 patient ( 3 % ) and in 2 group P patients ( 6 % ) ; the difference was not statistically significant .,3
A hypothesis assuming a reduction in pressure following subarachnoid anaesthesia for Caesarean section after the administration of 8 mg of ondansetron was not confirmed .,4
EEE participants enrolled and attended VA appointments at higher rates and within fewer days than those who received AO .,3
"Eighty-seven percent of EEE veterans attended an appointment within 6 months , compared to 58 % of AO veterans ( P < .0001 ) .",3
The median time to first appointment was 12 days for the EEE group and 98 days for the AO group ( P < .0001 ) .,3
"Additionally , a race by outreach group interaction emerged : black and white individuals benefited equally from the EEE intervention ; however , black individuals who received AO took significantly longer to attend appointments than their white counterparts .",3
Results provide needed empirical support for a specific outreach intervention that speeds enrollment and engagement for rural individuals in VA services .,4
Planned interventions to improve service utilization should ameliorate ambivalence about accessing health care in addition to addressing traditional systems or environmental-level barriers .,4
A total of 91 % of randomized patients developed a defined cold .,3
"In this modified intention-to-treat population , asthma symptoms did not get clinically significantly worse ( mean change in six-item Asthma Control Questionnaire < 0.5 ) and IFN - treatment had no significant effect on this primary endpoint , although it enhanced morning peak expiratory flow recovery ( P = 0.033 ) , reduced the need for additional treatment , and boosted innate immunity as assessed by blood and sputum biomarkers .",3
"In an exploratory analysis of the subset of more difficult-to-treat , Step 4-5 people with asthma ( n = 27 IFN - ; n = 31 placebo ) , Asthma Control Questionnaire-6 increased significantly on placebo ; this was prevented by IFN - ( P = 0.004 ) .",3
"Although the trial did not meet its primary endpoint , it suggests that inhaled IFN - is a potential treatment for virus-induced deteriorations of asthma in difficult-to-treat people with asthma and supports the need for further , adequately powered , trials in this population .",4
Clinical trial registered with www.clinicaltrials.gov ( NCT 01126177 ) .,4
Fifteen women per group ( n = 30 total ) were randomized ; 13 per group underwent surgery .,3
"Among drug-adherent participants ( n = 8 estrogen , n = 13 placebo ) , epithelial and muscularis thickness was increased 1.8 - and 2.7-fold ( P = .002 and P = .088 , respectively ) by estrogen .",3
"Collagen types 11 and 12 mRNA increased 6.0 - and 1.8-fold in the vaginal muscularis ( P < .05 for both ) ; collagen type Ia protein increased 9-fold in the muscularis ( P = .012 ) , whereas collagen III was not changed significantly .",3
"MMP-12 ( human macrophage elastase ) mRNA was suppressed in the vaginal mucosa from estrogen-treated participants ( P = .011 ) , and matrix metalloprotease-9 activity was decreased 6-fold in the mucosa and 4-fold in the muscularis ( P = .02 ) .",3
"Consistent with menopausal norms , serum estrone and 17-estradiol were low and did not differ among the two groups .",3
"Vaginal estrogen application for 6 weeks preoperatively increased synthesis of mature collagen , decreased degradative enzyme activity , and increased thickness of the vaginal wall , suggesting this intervention improves both the substrate for suture placement at the time of surgical repair and maintenance of connective tissue integrity of the pelvic floor .",4
"To our knowledge , My Road Ahead is the first self-directed online psychological intervention developed for men who have been treated for localised prostate cancer .",4
"The RCT will assess the efficacy of this intervention in improving psychological well-being , sexual satisfaction , relationship satisfaction and overall quality of life .",4
"If successful , this intervention could provide much needed support to men receiving treatment for localised prostate cancer in a highly accessible manner .",4
"Concentrations of NGAL at inlet and outlet were similar , and concentrations did not change over time in any of the anticoagulation groups ; thus no net removal or production of NGAL occurred .",3
Concentrations of NGAL at inlet correlated with disease severity at initiation of CVVH and at the end of a CVVH run .,3
"Concentrations of NGAL in the ultrafiltrate were lower with citrate-based CVVH ( P = 0.03 ) and decreased over time , irrespective of anticoagulation administered ( P < 0.001 ) .",3
The sieving coefficient and clearance of NGAL were low and decreased over time ( P < 0.001 ) .,3
"The plasma level and biomarker value of NGAL in critically ill patients with AKI are not affected by CVVH , because clearance by the filter was low .",4
"Furthermore , no evidence exists for intrafilter release of NGAL by neutrophils , irrespective of the anticoagulation method applied .",4
"The diagnostic model for discriminating UC from HV demonstrated an AUC of 0.988 , 93.33 % sensitivity , and 95.00 % specificity in the training set and 95.00 % sensitivity and 98.33 % specificity in the validation set .",3
"Another model for discriminating UC from CD exhibited an AUC of 0.965 , 85.00 % sensitivity , and 97.44 % specificity in the training set and 83.33 % sensitivity in the validation set .",3
"The model for assessing UC showed an AUC of 0.967 , 84.62 % sensitivity , and 88.23 % specificity in the training set and 84.62 % sensitivity , 91.18 % specificity , and a significant correlation with the clinical activity index ( rs = 0.7371 , P < 0.0001 ) in the validation set .",3
Our models demonstrated high performance and might lead to the development of a novel treatment selection method based on UC condition .,4
211 women were recruited : 105 received quinine plus China rubra 7CH ( China group ) and 106 received quinine only ( Standard group ) .,3
A decrease in proportion of patients presenting with side-effects was observed in the China group from day 0 to day 6 of follow-up ( 53.9 % -23.3 % ) whereas the proportion of patients with side-effects in the Standard group did not change significantly ( 85.9 % on day 0 vs. 82.5 % on day 6 ) .,3
Ninety-six ( 72.4 % ) patients in the China group and 103 ( 97.2 % ) in the Standard group reported at least one side-effect during follow-up ( p < 0.0001 ) .,3
"The most frequently reported side-effects were tinnitus , dizziness and asthenia .",3
This preliminary study shows the interest of China rubra 7CH in limiting the side-effects of quinine used for the treatment of acute malaria in pregnant women .,4
"At each GH dose , the serum IGF-I standard deviation score remained stable over time after an initial increase after the start of treatment .",3
"On a high dose ( at 1 m2 equivalent to 0.056-0 .067 mg/kg/day ) , AHG was at least equal on GH dosed per m2 BSA compared with dosing per kg BW .",3
The cumulative dose and cost were significantly lower if the GH dose was adjusted for m2 BSA .,3
"Dosing GH per m2 BSA is at least as efficacious as dosing per kg BW , and is more cost-effective .",4
"Cumulative incidence of ESRD from 5 different starting points : eGFR of 30 and 15mL/min/1 .73 m ( 2 ) and 1-year ESRD risk of 5 % , 10 % , and 20 % , estimated by a published 4-variable kidney failure risk equation .",3
"566 participants developed eGFR of 30mL/min/1 .73 m ( 2 ) , 244 developed eGFR of 15mL/min/1 .73 m ( 2 ) , and 437 , 336 , and 259 developed 1-year ESRD risks of 5 % , 10 % , and 20 % , respectively .",3
"The 1-year cumulative incidence of ESRD was 4.3 % from eGFR of 30mL/min/1 .73 m ( 2 ) , 49.0 % from eGFR of 15mL/min/1 .73 m ( 2 ) , 6.7 % from 5 % ESRD risk , 15.0 % from 10 % ESRD risk , and 29 % from 20 % ESRD risk .",3
"From eGFR of 30mL/min/1 .73 m ( 2 ) , there were several risk factors that predicted ESRD risk .",3
"From eGFR of 15mL/min/1 .73 m ( 2 ) , only level of proteinuria did ; median time to ESRD was 9 and 19 months in those with higher and lower proteinuria , respectively .",3
Median times were less variable from corresponding ESRD risk thresholds .,3
"For example , median times to ESRD from 20 % ESRD risk were 22 and 25 months among those with higher and lower proteinuria , respectively .",3
Relatively homogeneous population of African Americans with hypertensive kidney disease .,4
"Results of the present study suggest the potential benefit of incorporating kidney failure risk equations into clinical care , with selection of a specific threshold guided by its intended use .",4
"CVI and BIS more accurately correlate with somatic response to an Observer Assessment of Alertness and Sedation-noxious stimulation than HR , MAP , CeREMI , and propofol effect-site concentration ( Tukey post hoc tests P < 0.01 ) .",3
"Change in CVI is more adequate to monitor response to stimulation than changes in BIS , HR , or MAP ( as described by the Mathews Correlation Coefficient with significance level set at P < 0.001 ) .",3
"In contrast , none of the candidate analgesic state indices was uniquely related to a specific opioid concentration and is extensively influenced by the hypnotic state as measured by BIS .",3
CVI appears to correlate with somatic responses to noxious stimuli .,4
"However , unstimulated CVI depends more on hypnotic drug effect than on opioid concentration .",4
"Because of technical problems with the nitrogen generators , target altitude was not achieved in the tents and only 21 of 37 subjects slept at an average altitude considered sufficient for acclimatization ( > 2200 m ; average , 2600 m ) .",3
"Therefore , in a subgroup analysis these subjects were compared with the 21 subjects of the control group with the lowest sleeping altitude .",3
"This analysis showed a significantly lower AMS-C score ( 0.38 ; 95 % CI , 0.21 to 0.54 ) vs 1.10 ; 95 % CI , 0.57 to 1.62 ; P = .04 ) and lower Lake Louise Score ( 3.1 ; 95 % CI , 2.2 to 4.1 vs 5.1 ; 95 % CI , 3.6 to 6.6 ; P = .07 ) for the treatment subgroup .",3
The incidence of AMS defined as an AMS-C score greater than 0.70 was also significantly lower ( 14 % vs 52 % ; P < .01 ) .,3
Sleeping 14 consecutive nights in normobaric hypoxia ( equivalent to 2600 m ) reduced symptoms and incidence of AMS 4 days later on exposure to 4500 m.,4
Demographic data were similar in both groups ( p > 0.05 ) .,3
Riker score was similar in both groups .,3
VAS score was also not significantly different between both groups at the recovery room .,3
Our study demonstrated that Dexmedotimidine and Remifentanyl had equal effectiveness in reducing emergence agitation in patients undergoing septoplasty under Sevoflurane anesthesia .,4
"Recurrence rates in single and double-burr-hole groups were 6.15 % and 4.83 % respectively , which was not statistically significant .",3
Most of the subdural hematomas can be dealt by single burr-hole drainage .,4
"GH increased IGF-1 , P1NP , 25 ( OH ) D , ucOC , bone marrow fat and lean mass , and decreased abdominal fat , hsCRP , and ApoB compared with placebo ( p < 0.05 ) .",3
There was a trend toward an increase in CTX and Pref-1 .,3
"Among all participants , a 6-month increase in IGF-1 correlated with 6-month increase in P1NP ( p = 0.0005 ) , suggesting that subjects with the greatest increases in IGF-1 experienced the greatest increases in bone formation .",3
"A six-month decrease in abdominal fat , hsCRP , and ApoB inversely predicted 6-month change in P1NP , and 6-month increase in lean mass and 25 ( OH ) D positively predicted 6-month change in P1NP ( p0 .05 ) , suggesting that subjects with greatest decreases in abdominal fat , inflammation and ApoB , and the greatest increases in lean mass and 25 ( OH ) D experienced the greatest increases in bone formation .",3
"A six-month increase in bone marrow fat correlated with 6-month increase in P1NP ( trend ) , suggesting that subjects with the greatest increases in bone formation experienced the greatest increases in bone marrow fat .",3
Forward stepwise regression analysis indicated that increase in lean mass and decrease in abdominal fat were positive predictors of P1NP .,3
"When IGF-1 was added to the model , it became the only predictor of P1NP .",3
GH replacement in abdominally obese premenopausal women for 6 months increased bone turnover and bone marrow fat .,4
"Reductions in abdominal fat , and inflammation , and increases in IGF-1 , lean mass and vitamin D were associated with increased bone formation .",4
The increase in bone marrow fat may reflect changes in energy demand from increased bone turnover .,4
Data for 2345 live-born children were analysed .,3
Hookworm was the most prevalent maternal worm ( 45 % ) .,3
Childhood worms were less prevalent .,3
Eczema incidence was 4.68 / 100 person-years .,3
"Maternal hookworm was associated with reduced eczema incidence [ adjusted hazard ratio ( 95 % confidence interval ) , p-value : 0.71 ( 0.51-0 .99 ) , 0.04 ] and modified effects of known risk factors for eczema : Dermatophagoides-specific IgE in children was positively associated with eczema incidence if the mother had no hookworm [ 2.72 ( 1.11-6 .63 ) , 0.03 ] , but not if the mother had hookworm [ 0.41 ( 0.10-1 .69 ) , 0.22 ] , interaction p-value = 0.03 .",3
"Similar interactions were seen for maternal history of eczema { [ 2.87 ( 1.31-6 .27 , 0.008 ) vs. [ 0.73 ( 0.23-2 .30 ) , 0.60 ] , interaction p-value = 0.05 } , female gender { [ 1.82 ( 1.22-2 .73 ) , 0.004 vs. [ 0.96 ( 0.60-1 .53 ) , 0.87 ] , interaction p-value = 0.04 } and allergen-specific IgE .",3
Childhood Trichuris trichiura and hookworm were inversely associated with eczema .,3
Maternal hookworm modifies effects of known risk factors for eczema .,4
Mechanisms by which early-life worm exposures influence allergy need investigation .,4
"Worms or worm products , and intervention during pregnancy have potential for primary prevention of allergy .",4
"Epidermal growth factor receptor assessed as a continuous ( logarithmic transformed ) variable shows an association with disease-free survival in Arm C ( P = 0.009 ) but not in Arm A or B. High EGFR expression was associated with worse outcome ( Hazard ratio ( HR ) = 2.15 ; 95 % CI 1.28-3 .60 , P = 0.004 ) .",3
Validation in a Greek metastatic breast cancer cohort showed an HR associated with high EGFR expression of 1.92 ( P = 0.0073 ) .,3
High expression of EGFR appears to be associated with decreased benefit from adjuvant concurrent trastuzumab .,4
"Since other treatment options exist for HER2-driven tumours , further validation of these data may select patients for alternative or additive therapy .",4
Depression scores were 50 % lower in the I-TEAM group than in the UC+P group at 3 and 6 months .,3
Those who received the I-TEAM intervention significantly improved their problem-solving skills and self-efficacy in managing their medical condition .,3
The I-TEAM group had significantly fewer ED visits ( P = .01 ) but did not have significantly fewer days in the hospital at 12 months after baseline .,3
Integrated telehealth care for older adults with chronic illness and comorbid depression can reduce symptoms and postdischarge ED use in home health settings .,4
The overall healing rate was 65 % and 94 % in the botulinum toxin A-diltiazem and partial lateral internal sphincterotomy groups ( p < 0.001 ) .,3
The patients in the partial lateral internal sphincterotomy group experienced significantly higher incontinence scores ( p = 0.04 ) according to the Cleveland Clinic Florida-Fecal Incontinence scoring system .,3
"In patients who had chronic anal fissure for 12 months , no statistical difference was observed in the healing rate between the botulinum toxin A-diltiazem and partial lateral internal sphincterotomy groups ( 100 % vs 100 % ) .",3
"However , in the patients with longer chronic fissures , the healing rate was significantly higher in the partial lateral internal sphincterotomy group ( 86 % [ 18/21 ] vs 23 % [ 5/21 ] , p < 0.001 ) .",3
"The 1-year follow-up period , subjective definitions of itching , and lack of anorectal manometry examinations and data regarding the effect of each treatment on anal sphincter pressure at rest and contraction are the key limitations of this study .",4
Combined botulinum toxin A injection with a topical application of diltiazem could be as effective as partial lateral internal sphincterotomy in the treatment of chronic anal fissure in patients who have chronic anal fissure for 12 months .,4
"However , in chronic anal fissures of longer duration , partial lateral internal sphincterotomy is associated with a significantly higher cure rate .",4
"This randomized , double-blind trial will comprehensively assess the impact of functional lung avoidance on pulmonary toxicity and quality of life in patients receiving concurrent CRT for locally advanced NSCLC .",4
The prevalence of requested non-cardiac surgery or invasive procedures was 14.6 % in 310 requests and 12.3 % in 261 patients .,3
"Among 310 requests , those were proposed in 11.3 % < 1 month , 30.0 % between 1 and 3 months , 36.8 % between 4 and 6 months and 21.9 % between 7 and 12 months post-DES implantation .",3
"The rates of actual discontinuation of DAPT and non-cardiac surgery or procedure finally performed were 35.8 % ( 111 of 310 requests ) and 53.2 % ( 165 of 310 requests ) , respectively .",3
"On multivariate regression analysis , the most significant determinants for actual discontinuation of DAPT were Endeavor zotarolimus-eluting stent implantation with 3-month DAPT ( OR = 5.54 , 95 % CI 2.95-10 .44 , p < 0.001 ) and timing of request ( OR = 2.84 , 95 % CI 1.97-4 .11 , p < 0.001 ) .",3
"There were no patients with any death , myocardial infarction , or stent thrombosis related with actual discontinuation of DAPT .",3
Those unexpected requests with premature discontinuation of DAPT were relatively common and continuously proposed during the first year following DES implantation .,4
"No death , myocardial infarction or stent thrombosis occurred in patients with actual discontinuation of DAPT .",4
"We enrolled 1341 patients , of whom 439 were randomly assigned to protocol-based EGDT , 446 to protocol-based standard therapy , and 456 to usual care .",3
"Resuscitation strategies differed significantly with respect to the monitoring of central venous pressure and oxygen and the use of intravenous fluids , vasopressors , inotropes , and blood transfusions .",3
"By 60 days , there were 92 deaths in the protocol-based EGDT group ( 21.0 % ) , 81 in the protocol-based standard-therapy group ( 18.2 % ) , and 86 in the usual-care group ( 18.9 % ) ( relative risk with protocol-based therapy vs. usual care , 1.04 ; 95 % confidence interval [ CI ] , 0.82 to 1.31 ; P = 0.83 ; relative risk with protocol-based EGDT vs. protocol-based standard therapy , 1.15 ; 95 % CI , 0.88 to 1.51 ; P = 0.31 ) .",3
"There were no significant differences in 90-day mortality , 1-year mortality , or the need for organ support .",3
"In a multicenter trial conducted in the tertiary care setting , protocol-based resuscitation of patients in whom septic shock was diagnosed in the emergency department did not improve outcomes .",4

"Initial MVPA moderated the effect of Staff supervision ( = -0.47 % ; p < .05 ) , but not Equipment alone and Staff + Equipment ( p > .05 ) .",3
Participants in the Staff condition that were 1 standard deviation ( SD ) below the mean for baseline MVPA ( classified as `` low active '' ) had lower MVPA levels at post-intervention when compared with their low active peers in the control condition ( Mean diff = -10.82.9 % ; p = .005 ) .,3
High active individuals ( +1 SD above the mean ) in the Equipment treatment also had lower MVPA values at post-intervention when compared with their highly active peers in the control group ( Mean diff = -9.52.9 % ; p = .009 ) .,3
These results indicate that changes in MVPA levels at post-intervention were reduced in highly active participants when recess staff supervision was provided .,4
"In this study , initial MVPA moderated the effect of Staff supervision on children 's MVPA after 6months of intervention .",4
Staff training should include how to work with inactive youth but also how to assure that active children remain active .,4
There were 35 patients in the PP group and 32 in the DP group .,3
The two groups were comparable in patient demographics .,3
"The thoracic stage of the operation was longer in the DP group than in the PP group ( 87 24 minutes vs 68 22 minutes , p < 0.001 ) , and the volume of blood loss was higher ( 89 18 mL vs 67 16 mL , p < 0.001 ) .",3
"The surgeon 's eye blink rate at the end of thoracic stage decreased more from baseline in the DP group than in the PP group ( 3.0 1.4 blinks/min vs 1.2 0.9 blinks/min , p < 0.001 ) , and the surgeon 's symptom scale score was higher after operation with the patient in the DP than in the PP ( 6.29 1.54 vs 3.13 2.82 , p < 0.001 ) .",3
No conversion to open thoracotomy was recorded in either group .,3
Thoracoscopic esophagectomy in the PP provided less workload and better ergonomic results than the DP .,4
Further study based on a larger number of patients is required to confirm these findings .,4
"Where the role of cytoreductive surgery is widely accepted in the initial treatment of ovarian cancer , its value in recurrent platinum-sensitive epithelial ovarian cancer has not been established so far .",4
A better understanding of the benefits and patients selection criteria for secondary cytoreductive surgery has to be obtained .,4
Therefore the 4th ovarian cancer consensus conference in 2010 stated that randomized controlled phase 3 trials evaluating the role of surgery in platinum-sensitive recurrent epithelial ovarian cancer are urgently needed .,4
We present a recently started multicentre randomized controlled trial that will investigate the role of secondary cytoreductive surgery followed by chemotherapy will improve progression free survival in selected patients with first recurrence of platinum-sensitive epithelial ovarian cancer .,4
We prospectively studied 419 patients with HFpEF using echocardiography and sphygmomanometry to assess HFpEF pathophysiologic markers .,3
Cox proportional hazards analyses were used to determine the associations between pathophysiologic markers and outcomes .,3
Mean age was 6512 years ; 62 % were women ; 39 % were black ; comorbidities were common ; and study participants met published criteria for HFpEF .,3
"RV abnormalities were frequent : 28 % had abnormal tricuspid annular plane systolic excursion , 15 % had reduced RV fractional area change , and 34 % had RV hypertrophy .",3
"During a median follow-up time of 18 months , 102 ( 24 % ) were hospitalized for HF and 175 ( 42 % ) experienced the composite end point of cardiovascular hospitalization or death .",3
"Decreased LV compliance , measured as reduced LV end-diastolic volume at an idealized LV end-diastolic pressure of 20 mm Hg ( EDV20 ) , and RV remodeling , as indicated by increased RV wall thickness , were the 2 pathophysiologic markers most predictive of worse outcomes : adjusted hazard ratio per 1 SD decrease in EDV20 = 1.39 ( 95 % confidence interval [ CI ] , 1.10-1 .75 ; P = 0.006 ) , and hazard ratio per 1 SD increase in RV wall thickness = 1.37 ( 95 % CI , 1.16-1 .61 ; P < 0.001 ) .",3
These associations persisted after additional adjustment for markers of HF severity .,3
"By contrast , markers of LV relaxation , longitudinal LV systolic dysfunction , and ventricular-arterial coupling were not significantly associated with adverse outcomes .",3
"In patients with HFpEF , reduced LV compliance and RV remodeling are the strongest pathophysiologic predictors of adverse outcomes .",4
There were no significant anthropometric changes between conditions .,3
"Appetite scores , hedonic ratings of ` liking ' , and ad libitum EI all significantly increased under the FASTED condition ( p < 0.05 ) .",3
"Under the FASTED condition there were significant increases in the RRV of snack foods ; similarly , explicit ` wanting ' and ` liking ' significantly increased for all food categories .",3
"` Liking ' of sweet foods remained high across-meals under FASTED , but savory foods decreased in hedonic saliency .",3
"Relative to a fed state , we observed an increase in hedonic ratings of food , the rewarding value of food , and food intake after a 24 hr fast .",4
Alliesthesia to food and food cues is suggested by heightened hedonic ratings under the FASTED condition relative to FED .,4
There were no significant differences between groups in FACT-G scores .,3
"Nurse navigator patients reported significantly higher scores on the PACIC and reported significantly fewer problems with care , especially psychosocial care , care coordination , and information , as measured by the Picker instrument .",3
"Cumulative costs after diagnosis did not differ significantly between groups , but lung cancer costs were $ 6,852 less among nurse navigator patients .",3
"Compared with enhanced usual care , nurse navigator support for patients with cancer early in their course improves patient experience and reduces problems in care , but did not differentially affect quality of life .",4
Our data demonstrate that pre-allergen exposure to UFP had no acute effect on the allergic inflammation .,4
"However , the subgroup analysis lead to the speculation that inhaled UFP particles might have a long-term effect on the inflammatory course in asthmatic patients .",4
This should be reconfirmed in further studies with an appropriate study design and sufficient number of subjects .,4
Eighty-two patients completed the study .,3
"The MASI score fell significantly in both groups , but a greater decrease was seen in those who received hydroquinone ( 43.515.5 % vs 18.620.8 % , p < .001 ) .",3
Postinflammatory pigmentation occurred in 5.2 % of the zinc group and irritation in 30.9 % of the hydroquinone group .,3
"Topical zinc therapy is not highly effective in reducing the severity of melasma , but further trials are needed to determine whether adding zinc to current topical treatments could improve treatment response .",4
"Mixed modeling , adjusted for the infant 's gender , gestational age , postmenstrual age and birth weight , was used to handle interdependency among repeated measures within subjects .",3
"A significant main effect for stimulation mode ( SHAM pacifier vs PULSED orosensory ) was found among preterm infants for NNS bursts per min ( P = 0.003 ) , NNS events per min ( P = 0.033 ) and for total oral compressions per min ( NNS + nonNNS ) ( P = 0.016 ) .",3
Pairwise comparison of adjusted means using Bonferroni adjustment indicated RDS and CLD infants showed the most significant gains on these NNS performance indices .,3
CLD infants in the treatment group showed significantly shorter LOS by an average of 2.5 days .,3
"FM PULSED orocutaneous pulse train stimuli delivered through a silicone pacifier are effective in facilitating NNS burst development in tube-fed RDS and CLD preterm infants , with an added benefit of reduced LOS for CLD infants .",4
Forty-nine participants with FCA for both EC and non-EC granules were included in the primary analyses .,3
"FCA geometric means were as follows : 21.8 % ( 500 mg ) , 9.2 % ( 1000 mg ) , and 11.7 % ( 1500 mg ) for non-EC granules compared with 3.3 % ( 500 mg ) , 1.2 % ( 1000 mg ) , and 2.1 % for EC granules .",3
"Cumulative 48-h FCA of EC calcium was 85 % lower ( P < 0.001 ) than that of non-EC calcium , after adjustment for dose .",3
"In comparison to 500 mg , the FCA for the 1000-mg dose was 61 % lower ( P < 0.001 ) and was 42 % lower ( P = 0.002 ) for the 1500-mg dose , after adjustment for formulation .",3
A pH-sensitive enteric coating substantially reduced calcium absorption from a prenatal multi-micronutrient powder .,4
"In its current formulation , this novel supplement is not suitable for clinical use .",4
"FCA was highly dose-dependent , such that doses of 1000 and 1500 mg delivered only negligibly more bioavailable calcium than the 500-mg dose .",4
This trial was registered at clinicaltrials.gov as NCT01678079 .,4
"In treatment group , volar tilt was ( 11.92.7 ) , ulnar deviation was ( 20.8 + 2.9 ) , and radial height was ( 10.91.8 ) mm ; while volar tilt was ( 9.11.6 ) , ulnar deviation was ( 17.12.9 ) , and radial height was ( 8.11.5 ) mm in control group .",3
"Treatment group was better than control group in volar tilt , ulnar deviation and radial height .",3
"Clinical cure time in treatment group was ( 12.02.3 ) weeks , shorter than control group ( 18.04.1 ) weeks .",3
The incidence of complications in treatment group was lower than control group .,3
"According to Mehara functional evaluation ,20 cases got excellent results , 25 good , 3 moderate and 2 poor in treatment group ; 16 cases got excellent results , 14 good , 10 moderate and 10 poor in control group .",3
Treatment group was better than control group in clinical effects .,3
"T-shaped locking internal fixation with postoperative functional exercise for the treatment of dorsal Barton 's fracture fits for biomechanics demands , and has advantages of stable fixation , rapid recovery , less complications and good functional recovery , it has better clinical effects .",4
"There was only a modest ( Spearman Coefficient 0.38 ) positive correlation between 25-OH and 1,25-OH2 .",3
"For 1,25-OH2 but not 25-OH , the general linear model revealed a significant inverse correlation between serum concentration and CURB score ( p = 0.011 ) .",3
"Liver and respiratory co-morbidity were associated with significantly lower 25-OH values and renal co-morbidity with significantly lower 1,25-OH2 values .",3
"No significant differences of 1,25-OH2 or 25-OH between different pathogens ( influenza virus , Legionella spp. , Streptococcus pneumoniae ) were detected .",3
"For 1,25-OH2 , we found a significant and independent ( controlled for age , season and pathogen ) negative correlation to pneumonia severity .",4
"Therefore , supplementation of non-activated vitamin D to protect from pneumonia may be non-sufficient in patients that have a decreased capacity to hydroxylate 25-OH to 1,25-OH2 .",4
"Over 10 years , 199 ( 22.0 % ) women developed MCI and 145 ( 16.0 % ) dementia .",3
There were no significant associations between IL-6 or sTNF-R1 and cognitive status .,3
"High IL-6-sR ( 37,401.36 pg/mL , highest tertile ) at Year 16 was significantly associated with lower risk of dementia ( odds ratio ( OR ) = 0.54 , 95 % confidence interval ( CI ) = 0.30-0 .97 ) than in women with lower levels ( < 37,401.36 pg/mL , lower two tertiles ) .",3
"Women with high IL-6-sR at both time points ( OR = 0.39 , 95 % CI = 0.17-0 .89 ) or who transitioned to a high level ( OR = 0.35 , 95 % CI = 0.14-0 .88 ) had a lower risk of dementia .",3
"In this cohort of white , high-functioning oldest-old women , a consistently high or an increasing level of IL-6-sR was associated with lower risk of dementia .",4
"Compared with other studies of younger-old adults , this suggests that the effect of inflammation on dementia may differ in younger-old and the oldest-old individuals .",4
Understanding these differences will be crucial in interpreting results from ongoing clinical trials and in targeting therapeutic strategies to the oldest-old individuals .,4
Over half ( 56.5 % ) of the participants had ever used heroin while 37.7 % regularly ( daily or almost daily ) used heroin in the year prior to entering prison .,3
"Prisoners who regularly used heroin had significantly worse social determinants of health and smoking behaviours , including lower educational attainment , more frequent incarceration and earlier initiation into smoking .",3
Prisoners who regularly used heroin also used and injected other drugs significantly more frequently .,3
"At 12-month follow-up , the smoking cessation of prisoners who had regularly used heroin was also significantly lower than prisoners who did not regularly use heroin , a finding confirmed by logistic regression .",3
"Regular heroin use prior to imprisonment is an important risk factor for unsuccessful attempts to quit smoking among prisoners and is also associated with worse social determinants of health , higher drug use , and worse smoking behaviours .",4
More effective and earlier smoking cessation interventions are required for particularly disadvantaged groups .,4
Subjects were followed for 802430days ; 75 subjects in the usual-care group ( 316 hospitalizations ) and 81 in the monitored group ( 327 hospitalizations ) were hospitalized at least once ( P = .51 ) .,3
"There were no differences in Medicare payments for inpatient or emergency department visits , and length of stay was not different between groups .",3
There was no difference in 30-day readmissions ( P = .627 ) or mortality ( P = .575 ) .,3
"Scores for SF-36 and MLHF improved ( P < .001 ) over time , but there were no differences between groups .",3
"The percentage of patients readmitted within 30days was lower with telemonitoring for the 1st year , but this did not persist .",3
"Telemonitoring did not result in lower total costs , decreased hospitalizations , improved symptoms , or improved mortality .",4
A decrease in 30-day readmission rates for the 1st year did not result in decreased total cost or better outcomes .,4
"The abstinence rate confirmed by exhaled carbon monoxide was significantly higher in the KHRA group ( 61.1 % ) than the control group ( 49.1 % ) at the 4th week ( absolute difference 12.0 % , 95 % CI : 1.4 % -22.6 % ) .",3
"However , there was no difference in abstinence rates between the two groups at the 12th and 24th weeks .",3
"The predicting factors of 24 week 's smoking cessation success were age , older than 50 years old ( OR 2.02 , 95 % CI : 1.16-3 .52 ) , lower Fagerstrom Test for Nicotine Dependence score less than 4 ( OR 1.84 , 95 % CI : 1.03-3 .29 ) , and higher Self Efficacy/Temptation score ( OR 1.79 , 95 % CI : 1.05-3 .06 ) .",3
Smoking cessation counseling with KHRA could be effective compared to conventional counseling in the short period of smoking cessation .,4
Further study is needed to evaluate the long-term efficacy of KHRA in tobacco dependence treatment and to establish the indication and target population of this tool .,4
"Coefficients of variation for intraobserver and interobserver measurements of RV global area strain were 6.1 % and 7.9 % , respectively , and those for SDI were 7.6 % and 10.1 % , respectively .",3
"Compared with controls , patients had significantly lower global area strain ( P = .005 ) and greater SDI ( P = .008 ) .",3
The prevalence of RV mechanical dyssynchrony ( SDI > control mean + 2 SDs ) in patients was 30 % .,3
"In patients , global area strain correlated inversely with SDI ( r = -0.42 , P = .04 ) , RV end-diastolic volume ( r = -0.48 , P = .032 ) , and RV end-systolic volume ( r = -0.48 , P = .031 ) and positively with EF ( r = -0.51 , P = .02 ) , while RV SDI correlated positively with RV end-systolic volume ( r = 0.55 , P = .012 ) , pulmonary regurgitation fraction ( r = 0.54 , P = .031 ) , and QRS duration ( r = 0.51 , P = .022 ) and negatively with RV EF ( r = -0.62 , P = .004 ) .",3
"Multivariate analysis showed that RV EF ( = 0.22 , P = .048 ) was a significant correlate of global area strain in patients .",3
"In adults after tetralogy of Fallot repair , 3D RV deformation is impaired in association with RV dyssynchrony , volume overloading , and reduced EF .",4
"Demographic indicators , condition severity according to APACHE II , level of thrombocytopenia , levels ofplasma procalcitonin , interleukin-6 ( IL-6 ) and C-reactive protein ( CRP ) were the same in both groups .",3
"Level of AT was decreased in both groups ; however it was higher in the group-1 ( 50 % vs. 60 % , p < 0.05 ) .",3
"In the group-1 , microorganisms were found in the blood of 9 patients .",3
"In the group-2 , the microorganisms were found in the blood of 11 patients .",3
Inflammation markers were decreased after the treatment of septic shock in both groups ( p < 0.05 ) .,3
The decreasing of procalcitonin in group-1 was from 43.8 to 1 ng/ml in 14 days and from 12.8 to 1.6 ng/ml in 7 days in group-2 .,3
The decreasing of CRP in group-1 was from 224 to 114 mg/l in 7 days and from 146 to 60 mg/l in 14 days in group-2 .,3
The decreasing of IL-6 in group-1 was from 1617 to 100 pg/ml in 3 days and from 5895 to 77 pg/ml in 7 days in group-2 .,3
A level of AT was increased only in group-2 ( under 12 % per day ) .,3
"28-day survival was higher in group-2 ( 60 + / - 13 % vs. 45 + / - 13 % , p < 0.05 ) .",3
We did not find any complications of the treatment with AT concentrate .,3
Treatment of septic shock with high-doses of antithrombin III was effective and safe in patients with an agranulocytosis .,4
The massage group showed significant short-term reductions after the first and last day massages in self-reported pain and in ROM-associated pain as well as an increase in ROM .,3
Comparisons between the massage group ( N = 23 ) and the control group ( N = 14 ) on the last versus the first day data suggested significantly different changes including increased ROM and reduced ROM-associated pain for the massage group and reduced ROM and increased ROM-associated pain for the control group .,3
These changes occurred specifically for flexion and right and left lateral flexion motions .,3
These data highlight the importance of designing massage therapy protocols that target the most affected neck muscle groups and then assessing range of motion and related pain before and after the massage therapy .,4
"Comparisons with other studies also suggest that moderate pressure may contribute to the massage effects , and the use of daily self-massages between sessions may sustain the effects and serve as a cost-effective therapy for individuals with neck arthritis pain .",4
No subjects had deterioration of gas exchange .,3
The 2 groups had similar trends in arterial blood gases and breathing frequency .,3
No differences in duration of NIV or hospital stay were noted .,3
"However , a significant difference in acceptability was found : subjects preferred mouthpiece ventilation ( P < .01 ) .",3
Open mouthpiece ventilation is a useful technique and may prevent further deterioration of gas exchange in COPD patients with mild to moderate acidosis ( similar to traditional NIV delivered by a nasal mask ) .,4

"The educational intervention based on the use of the ePULab tool produced significantly better learning acquisition results than those obtained by traditional lecture-style classes : the total score improved in the control group from 823 ( SD 123 ) -116 ( SD 252 ) after the lecture , whereas in the intervention group , the knowledge score changed from 827 ( SD 139 ) -1583 ( SD 252 ) ( p = 001 ) with the use of ePULab .",3
The results show a higher effectiveness of the devised e-learning approach for education on management of pressure ulcers .,4
Our results reveal the suitability of the ePULab e-learning tool as an effective instrument for training on assessment of and treatment for pressure ulcers and its potential impact on clinical decision-making .,4
"Between May 7 , 2009 , and Jan 9 , 2013 , we randomly allocated 800 participants to D-FEC ( n = 401 ) and Bev + D-FEC ( n = 399 ) .",3
781 patients were available for the primary endpoint analysis .,3
"Significantly more patients in the bevacizumab group achieved a pathological complete response compared with those treated with chemotherapy alone : 87 ( 22 % , 95 % CI 18-27 ) of 388 patients in the Bev + D-FEC group compared with 66 ( 17 % , 13-21 ) of 393 patients in the D-FEC group ( p = 003 ) .",3
"Grade 3 and 4 toxicities were reported at expected levels in both groups , although more patients had grade 4 neutropenia in the Bev + D-FEC group than in the D-FEC group ( 85 [ 22 % ] vs 68 [ 17 % ] ) .",3
Addition of four cycles of bevacizumab to D-FEC in HER2-negative early breast cancer significantly improved pathological complete response .,4
"However , whether the improvement in pathological complete response will lead to improved disease-free and overall survival outcomes is unknown and will be reported after longer follow-up .",4
Meta-analysis of available neoadjuvant trials is likely to be the only way to define subgroups of early breast cancer that would have clinically significant long-term benefit from bevacizumab treatment .,4
"The sitting function scores were significantly increased in both control and EA groups compared with pre-treatment in the same one group ( P < 0.01 ) , and were apparently higher in the EA group than in the control group ( P < 0.05 ) , suggesting a better therapeutic effect of EA plus sitting training .",3
EA plus sitting training intervention was better for the spastic and hypotonic patterns of CP patients than the other patterns in the therapeutic effect ( P < 0.01 ) .,3
"Of the two 60 cases of CP children in the control and EA groups , 20 ( 33.33 % ) and 22 ( 36.67 % ) experienced marked improvement , 24 ( 40.00 % ) and 30 ( 50.00 % ) were effective , and 16 ( 26.67 % ) and 8 ( 13.33 % ) failed , with the effective rates being 73.33 % and 86.67 % respectively .",3
"Acupuncture intervention combined with sitting training is better than sitting training intervention alone in improving cerebral palsy children with parafunctional sitting position , especially for the spastic and hypotonic CP patients .",4
"At baseline , mean age of the participants was 55.2 11.8 years , and men showed a significantly ( P < 0.001 ) higher prevalence of arterial hypertension ( 55.5 % vs. 36.5 % ) and hyperlipidemia ( 50.7 % vs. 46.0 % ) and a higher blood homocysteine concentration ( 18.68 10.28 mol/L versus 11.69 6.40 mol/L ) .",3

"Least squares mean differences ( 95 % CI ) were statistically significant for vilazodone versus placebo on MADRS ( -5.117 [ -6.886 to -3.347 ] , P < .00001 ) and CGI-S ( -0.622 [ -0.845 to -0.399 ] , P < .00001 ) change from baseline ; statistically significant improvements versus placebo occurred at week 2 and persisted for the study duration .",3
The MADRS sustained response rate was 17 % for placebo and 27 % for vilazodone ( P < .01 ) .,3
Patients taking vilazodone versus placebo had higher rates of diarrhea and nausea ; most incidences were mild in severity .,3
Weight increase and sexual dysfunction adverse events were low in both groups .,3
A large and significant treatment effect on the MADRS and statistically significant improvement on the CGI-S demonstrated meaningful depressive symptom improvements .,4
Vilazodone was generally well tolerated .,4
"Forty-nine patients were randomized to air cholangiogram ( 25 patients , group A ) or dye cholangiogram ( 24 patients , group B ) .",3
Most of the patients had type II stricture ( 19 in group A and 20 in group B ) .,3
"Successful stenting and drainage were achieved in 25 ( 100 % ) and 24 ( 96 % ) in group A and 23 ( 95.8 % ) and 22 ( 91.6 % ) ( p = ns ) , respectively .",3
"Cholangitis developed in 1 ( 4 % ) and 4 ( 16.6 % ) in group A and B , respectively ( p < 0.05 ) .",3
There was no procedure-related or 30-day mortality .,3
"Use of air cholangiography was as safe and as effective as dye cholangiography in patients with malignant hilar biliary obstruction , and it decreased the risk of post-ERCP cholangitis .",4
"Greater oxygen cost ( per meter ) was found for stair ascending and descending using the single-point cane ( 121 % ) , SW ( 217 % ) , and WW ( 232 % ) compared with unassisted stair ascending and descending ( P < .05 ) .",3
"Increased HR response ( per meter ) was found for stair ascending and descending using the single-point cane ( 116 % ) , SW ( 126 % ) , and WW ( 147 % ) compared with unassisted stair ascending and descending ( P < .05 ) .",3
"However , oxygen consumption ( per minute ) and HR ( per minute ) were not significantly increased during stair ascending and descending with the ADs compared with unassisted stair ascending and descending .",3
Participants stair ascended and descended at significantly ( P < .05 ) reduced speeds during trials with the ADs .,3
This research should aid clinicians by providing evidence to base recommendations on regarding AD usage when encountering stairs during home and community ambulation .,4
Thirty and 34 participants concluded the study in the tocotrienols and placebo group respectively .,3
Alpha-tocopherol levels were within the normal range for all subjects .,3
"As primary outcome , the normalisation of hepatic echogenic response was significantly higher for the tocotrienols treated group compared to the placebo group in the intention to treat analysis ( P = 0.039 ; 95 % CI = 0.896-6 .488 ) .",3
"As secondary objective , the per protocol assessment also showed significant rate of remission ( P = 0.014 ; 95 % CI = 1.117-9 .456 ) .",3
"Worsening of NAFLD grade was recorded in two patients in the placebo group , but none in the group treated with tocotrienols .",3

Postprandial blood glucose ( 9.270.4 versus 10.10.4 mmol/L ; p = 0.001 ) and HbA1c ( 6.840.15 ( 511.6 ) versus 7.100.17 % ( 541.9 mmol/mol ) ; p < 0.001 ) were significantly reduced with saxagliptin treatment compared to placebo .,3
RCF was significantly reduced after treatment with saxagliptin ( 28813.2 versus 31414.1 AU ; p = 0.033 ) .,3
This was most pronounced in a subgroup of patients ( n = 32 ) with a fall in postprandial blood glucose ( 28012.1 versus 31416.6 AU ; p = 0.011 ) .,3
"No significant changes in RCF were seen during flicker-light exposure between placebo and saxagliptin , but the vasodilatory capacity increased two-fold with saxagliptin treatment .",3
"Central augmentation pressure tended to be lower after treatment with saxagliptin ( p = 0.094 ) , and central systolic blood pressure was significantly reduced ( 1192.3 versus 1242.3 mmHg ; p = 0.038 ) .",3
Our data suggest that treatment with saxagliptin for 6 weeks normalizes retinal capillary flow and improves central hemodynamics in type-2 diabetes .,4
"Compared with before treatment in the same group , the integrals of Chinese medical syndromes both decreased after treatment in the two groups ( P < 0.05 ) .",3
The width of spleens decreased in the treatment group more obviously after treatment than before treatment ( P < 0.05 ) .,3
"Compared with the control group , the integrals of Chinese medical syndromes and the width of spleens were more obviously improved in the treatment group , showing statistical difference ( P < 0.05 ) .",3
"Compared with before treatment in the same group , levels of ALT , HA , and LN significantly decreased , and the level of A/G significantly increased after treatment in the two groups , showing statistical difference ( P < 0.05 ) .",3
"Compared with the control group , the A/G level , HA , and LN were more obviously improved in the treatment group , showing statistical difference ( P < 0.05 ) .",3
"The total effective rate was 76 % in the treatment group and 46 % in the control group , showing statistical difference ( P < 0.05 ) .",3
Treating CH-BLF in different stages by ABRSM got better effect than using CBRT alone .,4
It could favorably improve clinical symptoms of CHBLF patients and their serum biochemical indicators .,4
"Among aortoiliac , femoropopliteal and tibioperoneal lesions , tibioperoneal lesions at six months were found to be more symptomatic 6 ( 86 % ) and amputation 4 ( 57 % ) .",3
Two carotid lesions at follow up were asymptomatic without stroke .,3
"Endovascular treatment of peripheral vascular lesions , i.e. , aortoiliac , femoropopliteal tibioperoneal and carotid lesions were satisfactory in immediate outcome .",4
Tibioperoneal lesions were more symptomatic and limb amputation at six months .,4
"Subtle differences in group structure , participation/communication and utility/relevance between peer - and clinician-facilitated groups were identified .",3
"Participants experienced both peer and clinician facilitators as helpful in promoting recovery , though they appeared to do this in different ways .",3
Peer and clinician facilitators offer different strengths in the promotion of mental health recovery .,4
"Results showed that mortality salience increased testing behaviour among participants who were made to feel vulnerable to HIV , but decreased testing behaviour among participants who were not made to feel vulnerable to HIV infection .",3
This research suggests that HIV prevention programmes must carefully consider how the association many people make between HIV and death may interact with people 's perceptions of their vulnerability to HIV infection to affect their willingness to engage in preventative behaviours .,4
There were no significant between-group differences in the primary outcomes .,3
"At week 78 , the between-group differences in the change from baseline in the ADAS-cog11 and DAD scores ( bapineuzumab group minus placebo group ) were -0.2 ( P = 0.80 ) and -1.2 ( P = 0.34 ) , respectively , in the carrier study ; the corresponding differences in the noncarrier study were -0.3 ( P = 0.64 ) and 2.8 ( P = 0.07 ) with the 0.5-mg-per-kilogram dose of bapineuzumab and 0.4 ( P = 0.62 ) and 0.9 ( P = 0.55 ) with the 1.0-mg-per-kilogram dose .",3
"The major safety finding was amyloid-related imaging abnormalities with edema among patients receiving bapineuzumab , which increased with bapineuzumab dose and APOE 4 allele number and which led to discontinuation of the 2.0-mg-per-kilogram dose .",3
Between-group differences were observed with respect to PIB-PET and cerebrospinal fluid phospho-tau concentrations in APOE 4 allele carriers but not in noncarriers .,3
"Bapineuzumab did not improve clinical outcomes in patients with Alzheimer 's disease , despite treatment differences in biomarkers observed in APOE 4 carriers .",4
"( Funded by Janssen Alzheimer Immunotherapy and Pfizer ; Bapineuzumab 301 and 302 ClinicalTrials.gov numbers , NCT00575055 and NCT00574132 , and EudraCT number , 2009-012748-17 . )",4
"After 8 weeks , most of the subjects in the control group did not display any noted positive difference in either PISQ score ( 4/6 ) or in their muscle strength ( 4/6 ) .",3
"However , a noted progressive difference were observed in subjects who were placed in the Kegel group ; PISQ score ( 5/6 ) and muscles strength ( 4/6 ) .",3
"The noted difference in the Kegel group subjects was that if progress is observed in the sexual function , improvement is also observed in the strength of at least 2 types of muscles ( either abdominal or PFM muscles ) .",4
"Thus , EMG measurement is a potential technique to quantify the changes in female sexual function .",4
Further work will be conducted to validate this assumption .,4
"Percent changes were significantly greater in floor vs. control for ultra-distal areal BMD by DXA at 12-weeks ( 1 % [ -2,5 ] vs.-5 % [ -8 , -2 ] respectively , p = 0.02 ) and 4-months post ( 5 % [ 1,8 ] vs -2 % [ -5,2 ] , p = 0.03 ) and in HMMS vs. controls for trabecular vBMD by pQCT at 12-weeks ( 4 % [ 0 , 8 ] , vs. -8 % [ -14 , -2 ] , p = 0.02 ) .",3
"Children exposed to HMMS showed positive changes in cortical BMC , area , and cortical vBMD after 12 weeks that remained 4 months post-intervention .",3
"Children exposed to floor exercise showed positive changes in cortical BMC , area , and periosteal circumference 4-months post-intervention .",3
"Controls had decreased trabecular BMD , but increased bone area and periosteal circumference .",3
Exposure to floor exercise and HMMS increased trabecular aBMD and vBMD in the radius .,4
"A total of 107 patients , median age 63 years , were randomised .",3
Forty-three ( 40 % ) had received > 2 lines of prior chemotherapy .,3
The 6-month PFS rate was 29 % ( wPxl + S ) versus 34 % ( wPxl + P ) ( P = 0.582 ) .,3
"Median PFS was 4.7 versus 5.3 months ( hazard ratio 1.00 , 95 % confidence interval 0.65-1 .54 ; P = 0.99 ) .",3
"RR ( complete + partial ) was 29 % ( wPxl + S ) versus 43 % ( wPxl + P ) , P value = 0.158 .",3
"Grade 3/4 adverse events were 36 % versus 31 % ( P = 0.624 ) ; the most frequent G3/4 toxicities were vomiting ( 5.8 % saracatinib versus 8.6 % placebo ) , abdominal pain ( 5.8 % versus 0 % ) and diarrhoea ( 4.3 % versus 5.7 % ) .",3
Febrile neutropenia was more common in the saracatinib arm ( 4.3 % ) than placebo ( 0 % ) .,3
"Response , PFS and OS were all significantly ( P < 0.05 ) better in patients with taxane interval 6 months/no prior taxane ( n = 85 ) than those < 6 months ( n = 22 ) , regardless of randomisation .",3
Saracatinib does not improve activity of weekly paclitaxel in platinum-resistant ovarian cancer .,4
Taxane-free interval of 6 months/no prior taxane was associated with better outcome in both groups .,4
Twenty-five healthy males completed the study ( mean age 23.4 2.0 years ) .,3
"About 90 min after drug administration , PPC-5650 increased the volume tolerated at moderate pain during mechanical stimulation compared to placebo ( difference 13.5 , 95 % CI : 0.58-26 .47 , p = 0.04 ) , but there was no effects on thermal - , electrical - , and chemical-induced pain ( all p > 0.05 ) .",3
PPC-5650 did not affect referred pain areas to any stimulation ( all p > 0.05 ) .,3
"Ten participants reported adverse events during the placebo treatment period , and nine participants reported adverse events during the PPC-5650 treatment period ( p = 0.8 ) .",3
Sensitization to mechanical stimulation of the esophagus was reduced by PPC-5650 compared to placebo .,4
The overall safety and tolerability of PPC-5650 was acceptable .,4
"Thus , PPC-5650 may play a role in the future treatment of patients with GERD .",4
A total of 98 ears in 66 patients underwent intervention .,3
Middle ear effusion cleared in 44 out of 48 ears with laser myringotomy ( LM ) as compared to34 out of 50 ears with incisional myringotomy .,3
The perforation was still patent in 36 ears treated with LM while it was found closed in all 50 ears with conventional myringotomy after 2 weeks .,3
The hearing level improved with LM by 10-15 dB after first 3 months .,3
The aim of management in otitis media with effusion is ventilation of tympanic cavity .,4
Laser myringotomy is a best alternative to conventional one .,4
It also has comparable results with ventilation tubes ( VT ) .,4
The ears with refractory or recurrent MEE should have VT insertion .,4
"There was no significant difference in the incidence of pain on injection of propofol ( 34 % and 33 % in the counting and the non-counting group , respectively ) .",3
A multiple logistic-regression analysis revealed that the significant factors to cause pain on the injection of propofol were age and the degree of pain on inserting intravenous line .,3
Intensive counting did not reduce the incidence of pain on injection of propofol .,4
Age and the degree of pain on inserting intravenous cannula can be a useful predictor for an intolerable pain on injection of propofol .,4
"Of the 45 and 47 eyes in the treatment and control groups , 22 and 15 were basically cured , 12 and 5 had marked improvement , 9 and 20 were improved , 2 and 7 failed in the treatment , with the effective rates being 75.56 % and 42.55 % , respectively .",3

"Independence in performing the IADL was 40 % , while 60 % had help from relatives or community-based services .",3
This longitudinal study shows that persons with stroke in two groups with different exercise regimes during the first year after stroke did not differ in long-term outcomes .,4
Both groups maintained function and had a relatively active life style 4 years after the acute incident .,4
"The results underline the importance of follow-up testing and encouragement to exercise , to motivate and sustain physical activity patterns , to maintain physical function , not only in the acute but also in the chronic phase of stroke .",4
"Muscle strength , flexibility , agility , dynamic balance , and cardiorespiratory endurance increased in both exercise groups ( p < 0.05 ) .",3

FMD improved ( p < 0.05 ) in both exercise groups .,3
"Significant reduction in plasma cholesterol , triglyceride , high-density lipoprotein cholesterol , and C-reactive protein were found in both exercise groups , whereas low-density lipoprotein cholesterol , cortisol , and interleukin-6 concentrations decreased only in the BWM group .",3
"Buddhist walking meditation was effective in reducing depression , improving functional fitness and vascular reactivity , and appears to confer greater overall improvements than the traditional walking program .",4
"After treatment , the scores of HAMD were decreased obviously in the two groups compared with those before treatment ( scores in the acupuncture group : 24.48 0.28 vs 8.95 2.24 ; scores in the western medication group : 24.140.24 vs 10.291.30 ) , and the differences were statistically significant ( both P < 0.05 ) .",3
"Between the two groups , the scores of HAMD in the acupuncture group at the end of the lst ,2 nd ,4 th ,6 th weeks were superior to those in the western medication group ( all P < 0.05 ) .",3
"The content of serum 5-HT after treatment was increased markedly compared with that before treatment [ the content in the acupuncture group : ( 26.21 2.36 ) pg/mL vs ( 52.07 0.56 ) pg/mL , the content in the western medication group : ( 26.262.31 ) pg/mL vs ( 51.700.52 ) pg / mL , both P < 0.05 ] .",3
But there was no statistic significance between the two groups ( P > 0.05 ) .,3
The efficacy of acupuncture for depression is superior to that of western medication with fluoxetine .,4
BMD at 24 months .,3
"In Rx-naive women , BMD increased in the lumbar spine ( LS ) , total hip ( TH ) , trochanter ( Troch ) , and femoral neck ( FN ) in daily and cyclic groups ( within groups , P < .0002 , except cyclic FN , P = .13 ) .",3
"Increases were 2-fold greater in daily vs cyclic groups ( LS , 8.8 vs 4.8 % ; TH , 4.0 vs 2.1 % ; Troch , 5.6 vs 3.1 % ; and FN , 2.9 vs 1.2 % ; group differences , all P < .05 ) .",3
"In daily vs cyclic groups , radius BMD declined ( -4.2 vs -2.1 % , respectively ; both P < .01 ; group difference , P = .08 ) and total bone mineral increased modestly ( 1.4 % , P = .18 ; vs 1.5 % , P = .06 ; group difference , not significant ) .",3
"In ALN-Rx women , there were no group differences ( daily vs cyclic : LS , 7.5 and 6.0 % ; TH , 3 and 2.5 % ; Troch , 3.7 and 3.3 % ; FN , 3 and 1.5 % ; within groups , P < .003 ; except cyclic FN , P = .2 ) .",3

This will be the first study of its kind that will use rigorous study design to evaluate a theory-based innovative postnatal psychoeducation programme on maternal outcomes .,4
"The study may identify a potentially effective way of enhancing primiparas ' self-efficacy and social support , which may in turn reduce their risk of postnatal depression .",4
The Sigma Theta Tau International Upsilon Eta Chapter funded this study .,4
Baseline clinical characteristics were similar among the 4 groups .,3
"Although individual parameters such as intensity and frequency of abdominal discomfort , bloating or pain were reduced by OB over the 4 wk , no significant differences were observed between groups .",3
"Similarly , no difference was observed between OB treatment or placebo for mucus in stool and incomplete or difficulty of evacuation .",3
"However , evacuation frequency was significantly reduced after 4 wk by 80 mg OB compared to placebo ( -8.36 % for placebo vs -41.9 % for 80 mg OB , P < 0.01 ) .",3
"While 21.7 % of patients in the placebo group experienced regular intestinal habits after 4 wk , this improvement was greater for patients treated with 40 mg OB ( P < 0.01 vs placebo ) .",3
"Furthermore , a dose-dependent reduction in frequency of diarrhoea ( ( 2 ) - test for trend = 11.5 , P < 0.001 ) and an increase in normal stool frequency was observed .",3
"Combining individual variables into a global discomfort index revealed significant improvement among increasing OB doses , favouring 40 mg ( P = 0.013 ) and 80 mg OB ( P = 0.001 ) over placebo .",3
No difference was observed between frequency of adverse events for placebo vs OB .,3
This dose-ranging study demonstrates that OB at 40 and 80 mg can improve individual and global clinical symptoms of IBS compared to placebo over a 4-wk period .,4
"In the 4 % formalin group , 49 ( 86.0 % ) and 53 ( 91.4 % ) patients showed an improvement in symptom score and rectoscopy score , respectively ( P = 0.36 ) .",3
Symptom and rectoscopy scores decreased significantly after treatment in both the 4 % formalin group and the 10 % formalin group ( P < 0.001 ) .,3

"Biomarkers , such as frataxin , or measures for oxidative stress and ataxia ratings did not differ between CEPO and placebo .",3
CEPO was safe and well tolerated in a 2-week treatment phase .,4
Secondary outcome measures remained without apparent difference between CEPO and placebo .,4
"Eighty-two students ( 15.71.5 years of age ; BMI , 31.96.2 kg/m ( 2 ) ) were enrolled in the IG and 83 in the control group ( 16.01.5 years of age ; BMI , 31.66.5 kg/m ( 2 ) ) .",3
Retention was 94 % in the IG and 87 % in the CG .,3
A total of 54.5 % of the IG and 72.2 % of the CG decreased or maintained BMI z-score ( less than 0.05 increase ; p = 0.025 ) .,3
Sports participation was higher in the CG ( 47 % vs. 28 % in the IG ; p = 0.02 ) .,3
Mean BMI z-score change was -0.050.2 for students participating in sports vs. 0.010.2 for those not ( p = 0.09 ) .,3
This SBHC intervention showed successful recruitment and retention of participants and delivery of preventive services in both groups .,4
Meeting with an HE did not improve BMI outcomes in the IG .,4
"Confounding factors , including sports participation and SBHC utilization , likely contributed to BMI outcomes .",4
Data from 71 subjects who completed all efficacy assessments were included in the primary efficacy analysis .,3
"At the end of 12 weeks , there were significantly greater percentages of responders in groups given medium-dose OBS ( 52.6 % , P = .0092 ) and high-dose OBS ( 47.1 % , P = .0174 ) than in the group given placebo ( 5.6 % ) ; there was no significant difference in percentages of responders between the low-dose OBS ( 11.8 % ) and placebo groups ( P = .5282 ) .",3
"The significant compound responses noted in the medium-dose and high-dose OBS groups were accounted for by the significant histologic responses ; in contrast , all 4 groups ( including the placebo group ) had large symptom responses , and there was no significant difference in the percentage of subjects with a symptom response in either OBS group compared with the placebo group ( P .1235 ) .",3
There were no unexpected safety concerns or signals .,3
Peak eosinophil counts were significantly reduced throughout the esophagus in pediatric patients with EoE who were given medium-dose and high-dose OBS .,4

"We identified 2 independent SNPs located in the gene encoding DBP , GC , that were highly associated with serum DBP : rs7041 ( P = 1.42 10 ) and rs705117 ( P = 4.7 10 ) .",3
"For both SNPs , mean serum DBP decreased with increasing copies of the minor allele : mean DBP concentrations ( nmol/L ) were 7335 , 5149 , and 3152 for 0 , 1 , and 2 copies of rs7041 ( T ) , respectively , and 6339 , 4280 , and 2341 , respectively , for rs705117 ( G ) .",3
DBP was also associated with rs12144344 ( P = 5.9 10 ) in ST6GALNAC3 .,3
"In this GWAS analysis , to our knowledge the first to examine this biochemical phenotype , 2 variants in GC -- one exonic and one intronic -- were associated with serum DBP concentrations at the genome-wide level of significance .",4
"Understanding the genetic contributions to circulating DBP may provide greater insights into the vitamin D binding , transport , and other functions of DBP and the effect of vitamin D status on health outcomes .",4
"When time-dependent changes in the visual analogue scale scores for pruritus of both groups were considered , both treatment methods were found to be remarkably successful ( p < 0.0001 ) .",3
"In addition , an insignificant group-time interaction was identified ( p = 0.753 ) .",3
Topical emollients were found to be effective in the treatment of PUVA-induced pruritus .,4

"We designed a patient-level , randomized , controlled trial , enrolling adults with above-target BP ( as defined by Canadian guidelines ) through community pharmacies , hospitals , or primary care teams in 23 communities in Alberta .",3
"Intervention group patients received an assessment of BP and cardiovascular risk , education on hypertension , prescribing of antihypertensive medications , laboratory monitoring , and monthly follow-up visits for 6 months ( all by their pharmacist ) .",3
"Control group patients received a wallet card for BP recording , written hypertension information , and usual care from their pharmacist and physician .",3
Primary outcome was the change in systolic BP at 6 months .,3
"A total of 248 patients ( mean age , 64 years ; 49 % male ) were enrolled .",3
Baseline meanSD systolic/diastolic BP was 15014/8411 mm Hg .,3
"The intervention group had a meanSE reduction in systolic BP at 6 months of 18.31.2 compared with 11.81.9 mm Hg in the control group , an adjusted difference of 6.61.9 mm Hg ( P = 0.0006 ) .",3
"The adjusted odds of patients achieving BP targets was 2.32 ( 95 % confidence interval , 1.17-4 .15 in favor of the intervention ) .",3
Pharmacist prescribing for patients with hypertension resulted in a clinically important and statistically significant reduction in BP .,4
"Policy makers should consider an expanded role for pharmacists , including prescribing , to address the burden of hypertension .",4
The initial success rate was 76.9 % ( 20/26 ) .,3
Recurrence rate was 23 % ( 6/26 ) .,3
Four patients underwent a re-application of fibrin glue and the fistulas of these patients closed .,3
Total recurrence rate was 7.6 % ( 2/26 ) .,3
The overall success rate was 69.2 % ( 18/26 ) .,3
"Fibrin glue application was thus found to be an easy , safe , successful alternative treatment in the management of fistulas-in-ano .",4
"Specifically , this therapeutic option demonstrated his efficacy for simple non-ramificated transsphincteric and intersphincteric fistulas .",4
Multicentric randomized clinical trials with more representative sample seem to be necessary to investigate the best patients to treat by fibrin glue injection and the optimal application technique to improve these results .,4
"Both the treatment group and the control group showed significant improvements in clinical symptoms and signs ( hand numbness and pain , and reduced senses of touch , pain , and vibration ) , cold water loading test ( CWLT ) , and electroneuromyography ( ENMG ) after treatments ( P < 0.05 ) .",3
And the treatment group had significantly more improvements than the control group ( P < 0.05 ) .,3
"mNGF can significantly improve hand numbness and pain , reduced senses of touch , pain , and vibration , CWLT , and ENMG , so it has better clinical effect and safety in treating HAVD .",4
Early diagnosis and treatment can improve the outcome of patients with HAVD .,4

"The women with Type2 diabetes who took fish oil compared with those who received placebo had higher percentage of docosahexaenoic acid in red cell phosphatidylethanolamine in the third trimester ( 12.0 % vs. 8.9 % , P = 0.000 ) and at delivery ( 10.7 % vs. 7.4 % , P = 0.001 ) .",3
"Similarly , the neonates of the women with Type2 diabetes supplemented with the fish oil had increased docosahexaenoic acid in the red cell phosphatidylethanolamine ( 9.2 % vs. 7.7 % , P = 0.027 ) and plasma phosphatidylcholine ( 6.1 % vs. 4.7 % , P = 0.020 ) .",3
Docosahexaenoic acid-rich fish oil had no effect on the body composition of the fetus and neonates of the women with Type2 diabetes .,3
"A daily dose of 600mg of docosahexaenoic acid was effective in ameliorating red cell membrane docosahexaenoic acid anomaly in pregnant women with Type2 diabetes and neonates , and in preventing the decline of maternal docosahexaenoic acid during pregnancy .",4
We suggest that the provision of docosahexaenoic acid supplement should be integrated in the antenatal care of pregnant women with Type2 diabetes .,4
"This study was feasible in terms of recruitment , retention and adherence .",3
"In addition , yoga participants had significantly greater reductions in weight , waist circumference and BMI versus control ( weight -0.82.1 vs. 1.43.6 , p = 0.02 ; waist circumference -4.24.8 vs. 0.74.2 , p < 0.01 ; BMI -0.20.8 vs. 0.61.6 , p = 0.05 ) .",3
"There were no between group differences in fasting blood glucose , postprandial blood glucose , insulin resistance or any other factors related to diabetes risk or psychological well-being .",3
"There were significant reductions in systolic and diastolic blood pressure , total cholesterol , anxiety , depression , negative affect and perceived stress in both the yoga intervention and walking control over the course of the study .",3
"Among Indians with elevated fasting blood glucose , we found that participation in an 8-week yoga intervention was feasible and resulted in greater weight loss and reduction in waist circumference when compared to a walking control .",4
Yoga offers a promising lifestyle intervention for decreasing weight-related type 2 diabetes risk factors and potentially increasing psychological well-being .,4
"Of the 287 women who were randomised to pelvic floor muscle training ( n = 145 ) or watchful waiting ( n = 142 ) , 250 ( 87 % ) completed follow-up .",3
Participants in the intervention group improved by ( on average ) 9.1 ( 95 % confidence interval 2.8 to 15.4 ) points more on the PFDI-20 than did participants in the watchful waiting group ( P = 0.005 ) .,3
"Of women in the pelvic floor muscle training group , 57 % ( 82/145 ) reported an improvement in overall symptoms from the start of the study compared with 13 % ( 18/142 ) in the watchful waiting group ( P < 0.001 ) .",3
Other secondary outcomes showed no significant difference between the groups .,3
"Although pelvic floor muscle training led to a significantly greater improvement in PFDI-20 score , the difference between the groups was below the presumed level of clinical relevance ( 15 points ) .",4
"Nevertheless , 57 % of the participants in the intervention group reported an improvement of overall symptoms .",4

No clinically significant systemic PD findings were detected .,3
The incidence of adverse events was low and similar across treatment arms .,3
"Systemic exposure to all three components of the closed triple therapy , following single-dose delivery , was similar to that seen with the dual therapies FF/VI and UMEC/VI .",4
"The delivered lung dose and safety profile of all three agents , delivered via a single inhaler , are expected to be similar to those of the dual therapies .",4
"Patients ( n = 347 ) received VI , placebo or SAL ( 1:1:1 ) .",3
"For the primary endpoint , substantial improvements in lung function were seen with VI ( 359ml ) , SAL ( 283ml ) and placebo ( 289ml ) .",3
"There were no statistically significant treatment differences between either the VI ( 70ml , P = 0.244 ) or SAL ( -6 ml , P = 0.926 ) groups and placebo .",3
"Both active treatments were well tolerated , with similarly low rates of treatment-related adverse events compared with placebo .",3
No treatment-related serious adverse events occurred .,3
"This study failed to show a treatment difference between VI and placebo for the primary endpoint , in the presence of a placebo response of unforeseen magnitude .",4
"Because the placebo response was so large , it is not possible to draw meaningful conclusions from the data .",4
The reason for this magnitude of effect is unclear but it may reflect increased compliance with the anti-inflammatory therapy regimen during the treatment period .,4

Sixteen patients ( 46 % ) had complete TSCI .,3
No AIS change was seen in 17 ( 52 % ) patients .,3
Complete TSCI patients had no motor improvement .,3
The AIS change in this group was solely due to increased sensory scores .,3

"Significant trends in age , body mass index ( BMI ) , HOMA-IR , HMW adiponectin concentration , C-reactive protein concentration and the frequency of achieving target triglyceride levels were observed across increasing quartiles of TXB2 .",3
"In a multivariate analysis , only younger age and higher BMI were independent predictors of TXB2 concentration above the upper quartile , while younger age and lower HMW adiponectin concentration were predictors of TXB2 concentration above the median .",3
"These results suggest that in DM2 , the most important predictor of HAPR is younger age .",4
"Younger DM2 patients may therefore require total daily ASA doses higher than 75 mg , preferably as a twice-daily regimen , to achieve full therapeutic effect .",4
Higher BMI and lower HMW adiponectin concentration were also associated with less potent ASA effect .,4
This is the first study to demonstrate an association of lower adiponectin concentration with higher serum TXB2 level in patients treated with ASA .,4

"PMTCT counselling at first visit had high coverage ( 86 % ) , however less than a third of women ( 31.34 % ) reported receiving contraception counselling .",3
"Although 60.8 % of women had reportedly disclosed their status to their partners , only 40 % were aware of their partner 's status .",3
Very few women had been tested for TB ( 10 % ) or received single dose nevirapine during their first antenatal care appointment ( 20 % ) .,3
Revised PMTCT guidelines aim to reduce the inequity between PMTCT services in high and low resource settings in efforts to eliminate mother-to-child transmission .,4
"However , guideline implementation in low resource settings continues to be confronted with challenges related to late presentation , less than four ANC visits , low screening rates for opportunistic infections , and limited contraception counselling .",4
These challenges are further complicated by lack of disclosure to partners .,4
Effective scale up and implementation of PMTCT services requires that such ongoing program challenges be identified and appropriately addressed within the local context .,4

"For the 60 mg Fe without food , the area under the curve over 8 h for serum non-transferrin-bound iron was positively correlated with the amount of iron absorbed ( R = 0.49 , P < 0.01 ) and negatively correlated with serum ferritin ( R = -0.39 , P < 0.05 ) .",3
"In healthy women , the production of circulating non-transferrin-bound iron is determined by the rate and amount of iron absorbed .",4
The highest concentrations of non-transferrin-bound iron resulted from the administration of supplemental doses of iron without food .,4
Little or no circulating non-transferrin-bound iron resulted from the consumption of a meal with a fortification dose of iron .,4
"Both during surgery and on postoperative days , the total volumes of fluids administered in the R group were significantly lower than those in the S group ( 1620 430 mL vs 3110 840 mL ; 2090 360 mL vs 2750 570 mL ; 1750 260 mL vs 2740 490 mL ; 1620 310 mL vs 2520 300 mL ; P < 0.05 ) .",3

The limits of agreement for Vo2pk between the ISWT and the ITM were 730 mL/min .,3
"Cardiorespiratory responses during the ISWT and the ITMT reflected a graded response to a peak , whereas the 6MWT demonstrated a rapid rise to a plateau .",3
The ISWT can be used instead of an ITMT and in preference to the 6MWT to assess cardiorespiratory fitness for a cohort of obese people with treated OSA .,4
"However , the imprecision of the agreement in Vo2pk between the ITMT and ISWT means they can not be used interchangeably in an individual .",4
"In the study group , age , the incidence of diabetes mellitus , smoking history , and operating time were significantly greater than in the control group .",3
The rates of SSI were 4.5 % in the study group and 14.5 % in the control group ( p = 0.037 ) .,3

Left ventricular contractility was assessed by peak power index and stroke work index .,3
Systemic arterial load was assessed by arterial elastance ( Ea ) and right ventricular afterload by pulmonary artery systolic pressure .,3
Endothelial function was assessed by reactive hyperemia index after upper arm cuff occlusion .,3
"Compared with placebo ( n = 25 ) , sildenafil ( n = 23 ) decreased Ea ( -0.290.28 mm Hg/mL versus +0.020.29 , P = 0.008 ) and tended to improve reactive hyperemia index ( +0.300.45 versus -0.170.30 , P = 0.054 ) .",3

Sildenafil had no effect on pulmonary artery systolic pressure .,3
"In subjects with HF and preserved ejection fraction , sildenafil displayed opposing effects on ventricular and vascular function .",4
"We speculate that beneficial effects of phosphodiesterase 5 inhibitors in the systemic vasculature and endothelium were insufficient to improve clinical status or that the deleterious effects on left ventricular function offset any salutary vascular effects , contributing to the absence of benefit observed with sildenafil in subjects with HF and preserved ejection fraction in the RELAX trial .",4
There were no significant differences regarding mean pulmonary arterial pressure at any time of evaluation .,3
"There was no significant difference between groups regarding other variables , such as mean systemic arterial pressure , heart rate , total dose of dobutamine , total dose of sodium nitroprusside , and need for fentanyl .",3
"Data analysis from patients included in this study allows us to conclude that intravenous clonidine ( 2 g/kg ) was not able to reduce the mean pulmonary arterial pressure in patients with pulmonary hypertension in group 2 ( pulmonary venous hypertension ) , undergoing heart surgery , or reduce or eliminate the need for intraoperative administration of dobutamine and sodium nitroprusside .",4

Starting from 2nd week visit of fixed combination of nebivolol and amlodipine treated patients had significantly lower levels of systolic and diastolic AP .,3
Already after 2 weeks of combined two-component therapy 60 % of group 1 and 52 % of group 2 patients achieved target AP .,3
"Target AP was achieved by the end of month 1 by 86 and 71 % , of month 2 - by 93 and 78 % of patients in groups 1 and 2 , respectively .",3
"In 3 months almost all patients had target AP , but in 1.6 % of group 1 and 2.3 % of group 2 patients this level was achieved after addition of a thiazide diuretic .",3
Patients receiving of fixed combination of nebivolol and amlodipine achieved noromosyslolia more quickly compared with patients who received free combination of nebivolol and amlodipine .,3

"Thirty subjects participated , and 26 subjects completed the study .",3
"Seventeen adverse events ( AEs ) were reported in 10 subjects , and all AEs were recovered without any sequelae .",3
No serious AEs were reported .,3
"Six subjects receiving the single dose of CG100649 had 9 AEs , and 7 subjects receiving the combination of ketoconazole and CG100649 had 8 AEs .",3
"The Cmax of CG100649 with CG100649 only and with concurrent administration of CG100649 + ketoconazole were similar ( 10.7 and 11.0 ng/mL , respectively ) .",3
The CG100649 AUClast with concurrent ketoconazole was 1.29-fold greater than that with CG100649 only ( 2074.0 and 2685.8 ng h/mL ) and demonstrated a statistically significant difference ( P < 0.05 ) .,3
"However , there were no statistically significant differences in vital signs , clinical laboratory test results , ECGs , or AEs between treatments .",3
"Although the AUC of CG100649 increased by 29 % with the concurrent medication of ketoconazole , it is considered that concurrent administration of CG100649 with ketoconazole would not change the safety profile of CG100649 .",4

"In intent-to-treat analyses , 77.6 % of the continuous use group and 71.7 % of the cyclic group continued OCPs at 12 months ( P = .21 ) .",3
The main reason for OCP discontinuation in both groups was running out of OCPs or forgetting .,3
"Across all visits , 26.1 % of women in the continuous use group and 22.3 % of women in the cyclic group ever reported missing three or more OCPs in the past month ( P = .43 ) .",3
"In multivariable analyses , regimen was not associated with discontinuation , but both previous birth and perceived ease of use of OCPs decreased risk of discontinuation , whereas desire for reduced menstruation increased risk of discontinuation .",3
"Although more women reported amenorrhea or infrequent bleeding in the continuous use group , more women in the cyclic group found their bleeding patterns acceptable .",3
Bleeding was not associated with discontinuation in multivariable analyses .,3
Pregnancy rates at 12 months were similar ( 16.2 % continuous and 17.4 % cyclic ) .,3
Continuous and cyclic OCP regimens were associated with similar 12-month continuation and pregnancy rates .,4

"The successful anesthetization of adjacent teeth occurred more often in the articaine group than in the lidocaine and mepivacine groups , although not to a statistically-significant extent .",3
The pain scores for the injections were comparable between the three groups .,3
"Local anesthetization using 4 % articaine with 1:100000 epinephrine covers a wider area of soft tissue and adjacent teeth than 2 % lidocaine or 2 % mepivacaine with 1:100000 epinephrine , which is sufficient for the extraction of one or two teeth .",4

We postulate that ivabradine and atorvastatin will reduce the rate and magnitude of PMI following surgery by reducing heart rate and attenuating catecholamine-induced tachycardia postoperatively .,4
"Secondly , we postulate that postoperative reduction in heart rate and catecholamine-induced tachycardia with ivabradine will correlate with a reduction in cardiovascular novel biomarkers which will reduce atrial stretch and postoperative incidence of arrhythmia .",4
"We aim to demonstrate that treatment with ivabradine and atorvastatin will cause a reduction in the incidence and magnitude of PMI , the benefit of which is derived primarily in patients with greater atherosclerotic burden as measured by higher CT coronary calcium scores .",4
"From the OCT substudy of the RESET trial , we identified 77 patients ( EES = 38 and SES = 39 ) who successfully underwent serial OCT examination at post-stenting and 8-12-month follow-up .",3
"The presence of ISA was assessed in the OCT images , and ISA distance was measured from the centre of the strut blooming to the adjacent lumen border .",3
"Incomplete stent apposition was observed in all EES and SES at post-stenting , and it was persistent in 26 % of EES and 38 % of SES at 8-12-month follow-up .",3

"In 72.9 % of quadripolar leads versus 65.0 % of bipolar leads , the LV lead successfully engaged the predefined ideal target side branch ( p = 0.47 ) .",3
"Implant duration and fluoroscopy times were significantly shorter when a quadripolar lead was used ( p = 0.007 and p = 0.001 , respectively ) .",3
The primary end point occurred in six patients ( 2.7 % ) in the quadripolar group and in 14 patients ( 8.0 % ) in the bipolar group ( p = 0.02 ) .,3
"Clinically significant phrenic nerve stimulation ( PNS ) occurred in 4.6 vs. 14.2 % of quadripolar vs. bipolar patients , respectively ( p = 0.002 ) ; all PNS were resolved noninvasively through programming in the quadripolar group vs. 84 % in bipolar group ( p = 0.75 ) .",3
The use of a bipolar lead was associated with a higher risk of surgical LV lead revision ( 6.3 vs. 2.3 % ; p = 0.057 ) and a higher incidence of dislodgment ( 5.7 vs. 2.7 % ; p = 0.16 ) .,3
This multicenter study demonstrates that the use of a quadripolar LV lead results in significantly lower rates of lead-related problems and reduced procedural and fluoroscopic times for biventricular system implantation .,4
This has important implications for LV pacing lead choice .,4

Ninety-five percent of 590 patients in the moxifloxacin group and 81 % of 151 patients in the control group had negative sputum cultures at month 2 ( P < .001 ) .,3
"The control regimen , age ( 35 years ) , initial sputum culture grade ( 2 + or 3 + ) , and male sex were significantly associated with higher odds of positive sputum cultures at 2 months .",3
"A 5-drug daily regimen with moxifloxacin results in significantly higher sputum culture conversion in the first 2 months compared with a thrice-weekly , 4-drug regimen in patients with newly diagnosed sputum-positive pulmonary tuberculosis .",4
"There was a statistically significant within-group improvement in VISA-A score for both groups ( standard , P = .03 ; do as tolerated , P < .001 ) and VAS pain for the do-as-tolerated group ( P = .001 ) at week 6 , based on the intention-to-treat analysis .",3
"There was a statistically significant between-group difference in VISA-A scores at week 3 , based on both the intention-to-treat ( P = .004 ) and per-protocol analyses ( P = .007 ) , partly due to a within-group deterioration at week 3 in the standard group .",3
