"After kidney transplantation , immunosuppressive therapy causes impaired cellular immune defense leading to an increased risk of viral complications .",0
Trough level monitoring of immunosuppressants is insufficient to estimate the individual intensity of immunosuppression .,0
We have already shown that virus-specific T cells ( Tvis ) correlate with control of virus replication as well as with the intensity of immunosuppression .,0
"The multicentre IVIST01-trial should prove that additional steering of immunosuppressive and antiviral therapy by Tvis levels leads to better graft function by avoidance of over-immunosuppression ( for example , viral infections ) and drug toxicity ( for example , nephrotoxicity ) .",0
The IVIST-trial starts 4weeks after transplantation .,2
Sixty-four pediatric kidney recipients are randomized either to a non-intervention group that is only treated conservatively or to an intervention group with additional monitoring by Tvis .,2
The randomization is stratified by centre and cytomegalovirus ( CMV ) prophylaxis .,2
In both groups the immunosuppressive medication ( cyclosporine A and everolimus ) is adopted in the same target range of trough levels .,2
In the non-intervention group the immunosuppressive therapy ( cyclosporine A and everolimus ) is only steered by classical trough level monitoring and the antiviral therapy of a CMV infection is performed according to a standard protocol .,2
"In contrast , in the intervention group the dose of immunosuppressants is individually adopted according to Tvis levels as a direct measure of the intensity of immunosuppression in addition to classical trough level monitoring .",2
In case of CMV infection or reactivation the antiviral management is based on the individual CMV-specific immune defense assessed by the CMV-Tvis level .,2
Primary endpoint of the study is the glomerular filtration rate 2years after transplantation ; secondary endpoints are the number and severity of viral infections and the incidence of side effects of immunosuppressive and antiviral drugs .,2

Assessment is a critical component of therapeutic intervention as it serves as the basis from which clinical goals and objectives are derived .,0
"Unfortunately , there is a dearth of reliable group therapy assessment instruments , especially for children and preadolescents who have severe emotional disturbances .",0
The purpose of this study was to test reliability of a newly developed group therapy assessment instrument for use with children who have serious emotional disturbances that require placement in a residential or partial hospitalization treatment program .,1
"After conducting an extensive literature review , the authors developed , refined , and tested a group therapy assessment tool for use in both music therapy and traditional therapy , measuring nine items : attention to task ( physical and verbal ) , eye contact , pro-social skills ( physical and verbal ) , empathy ( physical and verbal ) , and managing negative affect ( physical and verbal ) .",2
Six participants with a mean age of 9.5 ( SD = 1.85 ) years were randomly selected to test the group therapy assessment tool from a pool of 60 eligible children receiving group partial hospitalization therapy .,2
Participants were scored by three raters across two partial hospitalization therapy groups for inter-rater reliability .,2

Breakthrough cancer pain typically has a rapid onset and relatively short duration .,0
"Due to this temporal profile , it may not be adequately relieved by oral opioid analgesics .",0
"The sublingual fentanyl orally disintegrating tablet is a formulation by which fentanyl can be rapidly absorbed across the oral mucosa producing rapid-onset analgesia , and which may be effective for breakthrough pain treatment .",0
"A multicenter , randomized , placebo-controlled , double-blind comparative study was conducted to evaluate the efficacy and safety of the sublingual fentanyl tablet at optimized doses for breakthrough pain treatment in cancer patients treated with strong opioid analgesics at fixed intervals .",2

"Extensive decompression with laminectomy , where appropriate , is often still described as the method of choice when operating on degenerative lumbar spinal stenosis .",0
"Nonetheless , tissue-sparing procedures are becoming more common .",0
Endoscopic techniques have become the standard in many areas because of the surgical advantages they offer and the benefits for rehabilitation .,0
One key issue when operating on the spine was the development of instruments to provide sufficient bone resection under continuous visual control .,0
This was achieved by using endoscopes for operations carried out in cases of spinal canal stenosis .,0
This study of patients with degenerative lumbar central spinal stenosis compares the results of spinal decompression using the full-endoscopic interlaminar technique ( FI ) with a conventional microsurgical laminotomy technique ( MI ) .,1
"Prospective , randomized , controlled study .",2
135 patients with microsurgical or full-endoscopic decompression were followed up for 2 years .,2
"Alongside general and specific parameters , the following measuring instruments were also used for the investigation : Visual Analog Scale ( VAS ) , German version of the North American Spine Society Instrument ( NASS ) , Oswestry Low-Back-Pain-Disability Questionnaire ( ODI ) .",2
The doctor-patient encounter ( DPE ) and associated patient expectations are potential confounders in open-label randomized trials of treatment efficacy .,0
It is therefore important to evaluate the effects of the DPE on study outcomes .,0
"Four hundred participants with chronic low back pain ( LBP ) were randomized to four dose groups : 0 , 6 , 12 , or 18 sessions of spinal manipulation from a chiropractor .",2

Fifty-one clinicians reviewing results of 19 DBPCFCs with ambiguous clinical symptoms were randomized into a key first strategy ( opening the DBPCFC key before reviewing the symptoms on both challenge days and deciding on the DBPCFC result ) or a symptoms first strategy ( reviewing symptoms and interpreting both test days as positive or negative before opening the key and deciding on the DBPCFC result ) .,2
The bivalent fear of evaluation ( BFOE ) model suggests that fears of negative evaluation ( FNE ) and positive evaluation ( FPE ) are distinct features in social anxiety disorder as well as in non-clinical variations of social anxiety .,1
"The constructs can be measured utilizing the Brief Fear of Negative Evaluation Scale Revised ( BFNE-R ) and the Fear of Positive Evaluation Scale ( FPES ) , respectively .",1
"Whereas the distinction between FNE and FPE has been well examined in survey studies , concomitant evidence from laboratory tasks is scarce .",1
The present study tested whether subjective unpleasantness responses to short films simulating positive and negative evaluation from others are related to individual differences in FNE and FPE .,2
"Ninety-eight unselected individuals watched 24 short films displaying actors expressing positive , negative and neutral sentences and rated their responses on unpleasantness .",2
"Furthermore , pride responses to positive films were examined since these can be expected to discriminate between FPE and FNE .",2

It is believed that local anesthetic injected to obtain circumferential spread around nerves produces a more rapid onset and successful blockade after some ultrasound-guided peripheral nerve blocks .,0
"However , evidence demonstrating this point is limited only to the popliteal sciatic nerve block , which is relatively easy to perform by via a high-frequency linear transducer .",0
"In the present study , we tested the hypothesis that multiple injections of local anesthetic to make circumferential spread would improve the rate of sensory and motor blocks compared with a single-injection technique for ultrasound-guided subgluteal sciatic nerve block , which is considered a relatively difficult block conducted with a low-frequency , curved-array transducer .",0
Ninety patients undergoing knee surgery were divided randomly into 2 groups to receive the ultrasound-guided subgluteal approach to sciatic nerve block with 20 mL of 1.5 % mepivacaine with epinephrine .,2
"For group M ( the multiple-injection technique ) , the local anesthetic was injected to create circumferential spread around the sciatic nerve without limitation on the number of needle passes .",2
"For group S ( the single-injection technique ) , the number of needle passes was limited to 1 , and the local anesthetic was injected to create spread along the dorsal surface of the sciatic nerve , during which no adjustment of the needle tip was made .",2

"Over the years , there has been a strong consensus in dentistry that at least two implants are required to retain a complete mandibular denture .",0
"It has been shown in several clinical trials that one single median implant can retain a mandibular overdenture sufficiently well for up to 5years without implant failures , when delayed loading was used .",0
"However , other trials have reported conflicting results with in part considerable failure rates when immediate loading was applied .",0
Therefore it is the purpose of the current randomized clinical trial to test the hypothesis that immediate loading of a single mandibular midline implant with an overdenture will result in a comparable clinical outcome as using the standard protocol of delayed loading .,0

Endothelin-1 contributes to endothelial dysfunction in patients with atherosclerosis and type 2 diabetes .,1
In healthy arteries the ETA receptor mediates the main part of the vasoconstriction induced by endothelin-1 whilst the ETB receptor mediates vasodilatation .,1
The ETB receptor expression is upregulated on vascular smooth muscle cells in atherosclerosis and may contribute to the increased vasoconstrictor tone and endothelial dysfunction observed in this condition .,1
Due to these opposing effects of the ETB receptor it remains unclear whether ETB blockade together with ETA blockade may be detrimental or beneficial .,1
The aim was therefore to compare the effects of selective ETA and dual ETA/ETB blockade on endothelial function in patients with type 2 diabetes and coronary artery disease .,1
Forearm endothelium-dependent and endothelium-independent vasodilatation was assessed by venous occlusion plethysmography in 12 patients before and after selective ETA or dual ETA/ETB receptor blockade .,2

High tibial osteotomy is a common procedure to treat symptomatic osteoarthritis of the medial compartment of the knee with varus alignment .,0
This is achieved by overcorrecting the varus alignment to 2-6 of valgus .,0
Various high tibial osteotomy techniques are currently used to this end .,0
Common procedures are medial opening wedge and lateral closing wedge tibial osteotomies .,0
"The lateral closing wedge technique is a primary stable correction with a high rate of consolidation , but has the disadvantage of bone loss and change in tibial condylar offset .",0
The medial opening wedge technique does not result in any bone loss but needs to be fixated with a plate and may cause tibial slope and medial collateral ligament tightening .,0
"A relatively new technique , the combined valgus high tibial osteotomy , claims to include the advantages of both techniques without bone loss .",0
Aim of this prospective randomized trial is to compare the lateral closing wedge with the combined wedge osteotomy in patients with symptomatic varus osteoarthritis of the knee .,0

"Untreated behavioral and mental health problems beginning in early childhood are costly problems affecting the long-term health and wellbeing of children , their families , and society .",0
"Although parent training ( PT ) programs have been demonstrated to be a cost-effective intervention modality for treating childhood behavior problems , they have been less effective for children from low-income and underserved racial and ethnic populations .",0
"The purpose of this randomized trial is to compare the effectiveness , cost , and social validity of two manualized evidence-based PT programs that were developed and tested on different populations and employ different delivery models : ( 1 ) The Chicago Parent Program ( CPP ) , a group-based program developed in collaboration with a community advisory board of African-American and Latino parents ; and ( 2 ) Parent-Child Interaction Therapy ( PCIT ) , an individualized parent-child coaching model considered to be ` the gold standard ' for parents of children with externalizing behavior problems .",0
"This trial uses an experimental design with randomization of parents seeking behavioral treatment for their 2 - to 5-year-old children at a mental health clinic in Baltimore , MD ( 80 % African-American or multi-racial ; 97 % receiving Medicaid ) .",2
"Using block randomization procedures , 262 parents are randomized to CPP or PCIT .",2
Clinicians ( n = 13 ) employed in the mental health clinic and trained in CPP or PCIT are also recruited to participate .,2
"Primary outcomes of interest are reductions in child behavior problems , improvements in parenting , perceived value of the interventions from the perspective of parents and clinicians , and cost .",2
Parent distress and family social risk are assessed as modifiers of treatment effectiveness .,2
We hypothesize that CPP will be at least as effective as PCIT for reducing child behavior problems and improving parenting but the programs will differ on cost and their social validity as perceived by parents and clinicians .,2
