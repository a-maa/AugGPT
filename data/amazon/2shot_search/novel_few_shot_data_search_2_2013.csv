"Very easy to setup and though I have never done stairs before I was able to finish my stairs (cutting and fitting) in one afternoon.  It was a total of 19 treads and risers.  My neighbor had a pro do his stairs.  Took the pro over 3 weeks as he cut the boards wrong and they had to reorder the treads.  He came over to see mine thought my stairs were done much better.  Doing stairs, get it.  Ignore whiney reviews about quality.  The shipping tube it comes in will protect it.",21
"I have a Jet band saw and I too have been dreaming about owning a fence, but aftr reading the reviews her all 36 of them I would not ever consider purchasing this attachment, You would think jet customer service would anser these customer complaints. Evidently they could care  less about us customers,, so MR Jet customer surface person thatk theis and stick it where the sun don't shine.  Yes I was a John deere salesman , partsman, if I treated my customer this way we would have had to lock doors soon.",21
"This is the only car racing game you every need.  It can be taught in minuets to new players.  The game is at its heart a dice rolling game, so some of the decisions are out of your control but there is still enough strategy to make it feel like you are in control of your car.  The extra tracks are a most, the Germany and Spain expansion are very good tracks.  This is one of the few games that can play up to 10 players, which is super fun.",22
"I'm really disappointed in this.  We got it for our son and after one adult driven test drive to see how the controls worked (with no major crashes...a few wall bumps and one ceiling touch, by far nothing hard enough to visibly damage it) and it would not lift off again after that.  No visible damage, no gears stripped, full charge...all it would do after the first 2 minute flight was spin on the ground.  It's repackaged and on it's way back to Amazon as I type.  Save your money.",22
"This is a very Good game. It is so good. You get to play a lot of diffrent characters, like, Obi-Wan Kenobi, Qui-Gon Jinn, Queen Amidala & Captian Panaka. It woyuld be cool if they let you play Jar Jar Binks, but they don't. Oh, weel. Jar jar is one of my Favorite Characters in the film. the best part is you get to battle darth Maul. and it goes along with the movie too. This game rocks. This is a must have game for all star wars fans.If you liked this game then check out all of the other Star wars games",23
"One of the first games released for the Dreamcast, House of the Dead 2 is an instant classic.  The game is identical to the arcade smash with the inclusion of exclusive Dreamcast levels, and the graphics and detailed zombies will leave your mouth watering.  The voice acting is pretty bad though, making the voice acting from the first Resident Evil look like Shakespearian acting, but that is overlooked by the shoot 'em up action.  A light gun is strongly recommended, but the standard DC controler works just as well, somewhat.",23
