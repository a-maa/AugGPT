I encourage everyone to see this movie, The Orphanage, this is incredible!!!!!! It gets you glued to the tv!!!!! Its just the best thriller movie and the director is fantastic!!!!!! DEFINITELY WORTH BUYING!!!!!! INCREDIBLE EXCELLENT FANTASTIC!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!	0
I love the interaction between the characters, especially Joy and Elka. Victoria's vanity and Melanie's &#34;adorable&#34; are spot on! Having all the guest stars from other sitcoms the ladies have played in is truly interesting. Carol Burnett, Mary Tyler Moore, Bonnie Franklin, Georgia Engel, Tim Conway, Valarie Harper....and the list goes on. The comedy is well-timed, funny, and the cast knows how to maximize the effect. Overall a truly funny, enjoyable, heart-warming series with the best cast out there!	0
Needlessly confusing and characters I didn't care about so the DVD was shredded after the first fifteen minutes. Next time have a better opening, movie creators. That is all.Rotten Tomatoes gave this film a low rating. Maybe you should, too.Based on a roleplaying game of the same name.The budget for this film was a bit over $25M and it made a bit over $2M at the Box Office. The prosecution rests its case.OVERALL GRADE: D minus to D; WHEN WATCHED: April 2012.	0
I got a kick out of it. The cocky astronaut, the 50's space alien setup, and the humour. It isn't on a par with some of the other animation movies out there, but it is nowhere near being really bad. I was somewhat shocked at the people who hated it, but then there is no accounting for tastes. Cute, non-offensive, but still gently skewers the 'you are different from me' mentality. Overall, a solid 4 for animation quality, gentle skewers, and amenability.	0
Since this has been out for a while, and if you're researching season 5, hopefully you've already seen the 4 before it, I'll make it short.I've seen every episode of The Shield, and the finale of this season is one of the best episodes of TV - of ANY show - that I've ever seen.I think it's the second best season (second only to season 1) that this show has ever had.If you're a fan of the show, what are you waiting for?	0
I just wrapped up viewing the last of the Veronica Mars TV shows.  Had to get through all three seasons before watching the new VM movie.  Next to Firefly (another too soon canceled TV show), Veronica Mars is the best thing I've watched in a long time.  Highly recommended.  Great acting, superb writing, excellent &#34;snarkiness&#34; to keep things entertaining and moving along.  I have to say that they actually did a pretty good job of wrapping up entire season with the last episode.	0
This movie continues Murphy's niche of kid-friendly movies.  A lot of the scripted humor will make the kids laugh at loud, along with Murphy's ad-libs which are indeed funny.  However, the premise / plot of the movie is very predictable and adults in the room will absolutely groan and roll their eyes (that's what happened at my house).If you're looking for a movie to entertain late elementary / early middle school kids this one will be a winner - adults, not so much.	0
"""Hi folks, you may be wondering if I'm Martin Sheen.. well I'm not. Turns out i'm his vastly more talented yet less appreciated brother, thank you."" The Satellite of Love is malfunctioning while Mike & the bots unwittingly celebrate the 10th anniversary of MST3K. Joel & TV's Frank show up to help as they watch another Joe Estevez film... The Tonya Harding-ish Vivian Schilling writes & stars this 80's train-wreck about wearing your sunglasses (and acid washed jeans) at night while running from Soultakers."	0
BSG is always good TV.  When in doubt, look to Tricia Helfer and Grace Park, two of the hottest women on TV.  The show, built on the premise of a pretty lame show really developed the characters over the seasons.Tricia Helfer is particularly amazing in her role as an angel to Guyus Baltar, Park does a tremendous job in her multiple roles...oh yea, the male cast members are pretty good.  This show took the BSG concept way beyond it's origins to a full blown series.	0
A truly up-to-date mystery.  This was a well wrapped mystery that pulled me deeper into the politics and corporate dishonesty.  I liked the fact that I could identify the good guys fairly early on but still question who was trustworthy.  To watch the unraveling built the tension and kept the story interesting.  I wanted to watch the next segment to uncover more of the truth.  This is a great mystery and even at the end, I felt like I had answers but still had questions.	0
I love it's always sunny and wanted to own the seasons, but didn't want to spend a lot of money. Came to Amazon and managed to buy seasons 1-6 for less then $25!! Way pumped!The discs were clean, no scratches, worked perfectly. No problems at allAs for the first seasons of it's always sunny, you either like it or you don't. I used to hate this show, but it's now one of my favorite shows. If you haven't seen it yet, then get on it player!	0
Monk's 6th is just as hilarious and entertaining as the previous seasons. Adrian Monk is still miserable and continues to help Captain Stottlemeyer and Disher with solving murders, with the help of his devoted Assistant, Natalie. Throughout this season, Monk must deal with his crazed fan, help a rapper, teaches Julie Teeger about love, hang out with his psychiatrist's son, shoots Santa Claus, joins a cult, becomes a fugitive, and finally has a new lead in the murder of Trudy. I highly recommend MONK: SEASON SIX!!!	0
I was looking forward to this show... I've always enjoyed the shows about time travel.  But I still don't understand what causes him to go back in time.... if it was explained I missed it.There were some clues that I guess were too subtle for me to catch as they happened, and I only 'got it' at the end of the show... Is that what they were going for?  Anyway.. I will probably watch one more episode, and then if it isn't any better I'll pass....	0
"From what I can tell, Journeyman has gone the way of a lot of promising shows before it with low ratings. It's too bad as this show was starting to hit its stride, and had shaken my initial perception as a Quantum Leap ripoff. To the credit of the producers, the final filmed episode, ""Perfidia,"" offers a neat enough closure to the series that fans won't feel cheated. Hopefully, the Sci Fi channel or some other cable outlet will pick up the show--it deserves another chance."	0
This is no &#34;MURDER ONE, Season 1&#34;, but it is quite good.  If I remember my Wikipedia info, the network cancelled it after only four episodes, which is more indicative of network stupidity than of the show's quality.  I thought this was one of Rob Morrow's best works.  Regardless of the outcome of each case, guilty or not, the final minutes reveal what the &#34;Whole Truth&#34; was.  Don't be discouraged when Morrow's character loses the first three cases, since he then goes on a winning streak.	0
24 is the most  fun series I have ever seen on tv.  I love keifer Sutherland and it appears to me that a lot of actors get good parts and get in a lot of acting.  Also this series has people, even the bad guys speaking articulately and very rationally.  We are seeing a show full of admirable people not a bunch of losers.  That must be a part of the popularity of the series.Note something else, these people comply with the human requirement  of pronouncing judgement.	0
This set has been reviewed extensively so I won't get into too much detail except for why I gave it 5 stars. There are a lot of repetitive shows out there, about 100 regarding vampires, another hundred crime or law shows, etc. Yes, this is a crime show but they put a spin on it like no other. A serial killer who kills serial killers, rapists, murderers, etc? Awesome. The narration is actually amusing. The storytelling is amazing. I love it. It gets my 5 star vote.	0
We love this show!  The acting is incredible and the storyline is very believable.  There are characters you love to hate (like Tiffy) and then there are characters you adore, and others who surprise you in varying episodes.  Scott Foley is so good - you never know what to think about him - whether he's sometimes careless or otherwise brilliant and shows his &#34;human&#34; side.  He is also very good at dropping in bouts of humor when they are very much needed.  I highly recommend this show!	0
"I really hate sponsor product placement in movies. The ""Degree"" body deodorant is all over the episode, I get it okay, you want me to buy some deodorant, I already do, but it just looks stupid when I am supposed to imagine that this is a real ""GD"" ""Eureka"" secret genius town, and then you remind me with your Walmart Deodorant advertising, its stupid and annoying. Why cant they just have a list of sponsors at the end of the episode for someone who actually gives damn?"	0
A fabulous show that was cancelled far too early. For those who haven't watched it, the show is a satirical situation comedy that focuses on a fictional multi-national corporation called 'Veridian Dynamics'. The main character, Ted, is the head of research and development and oversees a quirky team of scientists and product testers. I love the humor and the relationships between the characters. Portia de Rossi is perfectly cast as the emotionless member of management. The 'commercials' for Veridian Dynamics are hysterical. I highly recommend this show!	0
This was a good show but thanks to the inconsistancy of the writers it lasted only four seasons.  The final season, to me, started to bring back some of the excitement and overall feel of the first season, which is easily the best IMO.  I could've done without the whole 'Sylar possessing Matt' garbage, because it was among the inconsistant writing and way too drawn out, but otherwise a pretty good ending.  Besides, if you already have the other seasons, you might as well get this one.	0
Some people will say its an amazing piece of film because it wasn't a major release, but in all honesty, it was just ok.  While the graphics weren't amazing, I still found the monsters themselves to be good.  The acting was alright but I just cannot get behind the instant love story.  There was a whole lot of build up to the infected zone and very little happened with it. All of that said, it wasn't a bad movie.  It is worth a watch if nothing else.	0
There were several places that couldn't have possibly been true to what would really happen after a nuclear strike; however, it did represent a small portion of what humanity would turn into in this country. I personally would have liked to have seen the storyline go a little more toward reality, but, I understand that our six-pack society, those who care more about the unreality of hollywood than current affairs, could not handle it. I really liked this show in spite and watched it on a marathon status.	0
The dudes are getting a bit more sensitive that I want them.  But hey stuff changes and it is still a lot of fun with math which I never saw coming.  Plus we get some super yummy guest spots with Lou diamond Phillips.  The guest stars are a lot of fun, you never know who is going to show up and I like that.  it is still an exciting show with a good mix of gun fire and family.  so sit down with your family and watch this.	0
I watched all seasons, and then have come back to watch it again. The ensemble is great, and Holly Hunter is stellar! Love the writing, the acting, the cast, the stories, and the interweaving of Earl, the angel, and Grace the tough cop with a huge heart. I really like Oklahoma City as the setting; it's my part of the country, and the Texas/OU rivalry is handled beautifully. It is more than just another police drama. Some theological and philosophical, social and cultural dilemmas are included. Great show!	0
This was probably the best season so far. Luckily I saw 200 & 201 when they were aired on TV (censored of course) but the fact that they are censored on DVD is complete BULL****!!!! I can't believe that Comedy Central released this DVD and still censored it.Usually I buy the seasons so I can watch them without commercials and UNCENSORED but I'm content with watching this season online for FREE. I returned this DVD to the store the next day. Comedy Central doesn't need my money anymore.	0
Our toddler loves YGG. The music is fun for her and she loves to dance. Her favorite thing is Super Music Friends Show, hehe. Her favorite episodes from season 3 are Treasure, Circus, and Bugs. For some reason she is terrified of Superhero though. This is my toddler's favorite show and she knows some of the songs by heart, and I do too since she likes to ask me to sing &#34;Gabba songs&#34; to her at bedtime. Treasure by Blizentrapper is one of her favorite lullabys now! haha!	0
I don't know if it was the movie, the lack of hysterical commentary or just me, but this wasn't one of KST3K's best efforts.  Outside of Forest Tucker jokes (which are always worth a laugh) there wasn't enough bad material to keep the show going.  Took me 3 sessions to finish it all off, at which point I was happy to see it over as opposed to wishing it would keep on going.But, as they say, even a bad MST3K is better than a good day at work.	0
"*SPOILERS!*This is my favorite Doctor Who season and the chemistry between the tenth Doctor (David Tennant) and Rose Tyler (played by Billie Piper) is outstanding.  I love watching them sing the theme to Ghostbusters, laugh together, and when Rose is possessed during a trip to the hospital, watching her throw herself at the Doctor for a kiss and he seems completely startled but as she walks off he mumbles  ""Yep, still got it.""  XD  David/Billie - you guys are awesome!Season 2 is a must for Doctor Who fans."	0
In all truth I started out not liking this show and I couldn't tell you why.  It was certainly right up my alley as far as the kind of shows I like goes.  But as I got further into the series I have found that the story lines have gotten better and better which is unusual for a TV show.  Usually they start weakening by the third season.  So I wanted to go back and rewatch fron the beginning.  Thanks to Amazon I am able to do that.	0
This show is worth watching. It only gets better as the seasons continue to build on a fantastically built foundation. It gives a fun plot each week, but what really holds it together is the amazing, personal character driven plots that underpin the series, bonding us to the show. You don't just love the stories of what the characters do, but who the characters are. The writters do a great job of growing these characters and letting us get to know them (& love them) more & more.	0
I absolutely loved this show. I see it has been listed as a cult thing and I'm not sure what that means. I'm a very senior Senior so my interest may be surprising but I had a hard time doing anything else until I'd finished watching the last episode. All the good things said about this series are true--I was just very disappointed to learn that it was ending with this season. I have recommended it highly to several friends, but haven't heard their feedback yet. What a gem!	0
We came into the seasons after they were over on the TV, but thought all three seasons were well written, entertaining, and fun.  It was easy to get attached to the characters and were glad we could watch two at a time because you are often left with cliff hangers.  Sadly, the end of this season left us with a major cliff hanger that will not be resolved until hopefully the movie coming out does.  That was my only complaint.  There should have been more seasons following this one.	0
Absolutely loved Season 1.  For me, Season 2 is the same plot over and over, continuing from Season 1.  The characters haven't developed much past Season 2.  Although I enjoyed Season 2, I probably won't buy anymore of the Eureka DVD's due to the repetitiveness. Overall, the idea of a town full of genius scientists is so cool!  I was hoping for a bit more innovation of the plot line because the idea of the show is wonderful and entertaining and because this show has so many great reveiws.	0
I tried watching this show a couple of times and couldn't get into it.  I love everyone in the cast, but just didn't find the show funny.  I finally sat down and thought I'd give it another try.  I wound up watching the first season in on day.  It's one part &#34;The Office&#34; with it's mockumentary style along with the varied humor levels of 30 Rock.  Unlike 30 Rock, as I've watched more seasons of the show, Parks and Rec has gotten better while 30 Rock did the opposite.	0
This series was a great show/series!  I find it hard to believe it got cancelled after only 1 season.  It was not shown or promoted because it is much better than shows that have made it for years.  The humor is fabulous...very similar to the M.A.S. H. television series.  The major networks all want criminal minds and csi type shows...we loose  with this all the same philosophy.  I wish they would make more seasons to THE UNUSUALS!  Maybe Netflix or Amazon will make their own series of this show!	0
Very interesting concept, except it's almost Game of Thrones set in reality as opposed to fantasy. And really, if the sex/nudity weren't so prominent, I'd be more interested. I think you can make it obvious what's going on without graphic demonstration. Felt the same with The Tudors, Borgias, etc. I guess I'm feeling just change the names of the characters and the setting, just keep the same plot lines throughout all these shows. But it is a good show, I've just seen it before with different names and costumes.	0
It's not the best movie I've seen, however I liked it. Could have been done better. Too many times you hear the f* word in this movie, too many. And the battles are way too bloody. Scenes are unrealistic. Example: when a guy on the horse drags a man into a tree with his face, face breaks into pieces. Also a fault when a woman without tongue suddenly screams. In reality she wouldn't be able to scream. The battles may not be very realistic looking, but story is fine.	0
I watched this because the Brits usually do a good job with good production values, casting and story lines.  However, in this case it proved a waste of 5 hours. The writers, directors and editors should be ashamed to put their names in the credits.  Important things happen with no apparent reason and the watcher is left scratching his/her head wondering what was the point.  The American general is miscast and not believable.  Lots of clicking of computer keyboards for solutions that never seem to work out. The ending stinks!	0
If you were a fan of the Veronica Mars series, you will love the movie. I love the way it was funded by fans too! I think the movie is even better than the series. It picks up Veronica's life several years after the series ended. The mystery is complicated and hard to solve. The decisions Veronica has to make are difficult life changing decisions. The acting was solid, the characters complex, and it looks like a much more expensive movie than it is. I hope they do a sequel.	0
Once you've started, you'll find it hard to stop.  Watching these great videos is like a narcotic.  You just want to be injected with another one, and another.  Then when they are all done you have to go through a withdrawal phase of disappointment that there aren't another 100 to go.Great fun, edge of your seat humor and drama combined.  Every actor fits the part perfectly and the bad guys are bad and the dead people are really dead. The star, Kyra Sedgwick, is outstanding and never lets you down.	0
After watching the first three seasons of 'Rescue Me' this season may disappoint some fans, it's still an excellent TV show, but they seemed to steer away from the firehouse banter that we've all become addicted to. The show is laced with wit, action and drama of the best kind. The cast is colorful with layers of deep emotion. After a long break I eagerly await season five! The show is filmed in widescreen and it looks great on a big screen. This season includes commentary and some interesting extras.	0
... my friend, this is. An almighty business man, accustomed to being sought after for his money or used by competitors, falls in love with a female artist hired to make a fresco for the foyer of his building. Being cautious he sets his spies on her, planting microphones and cameras in her rooms and workrooms, only to be embarrassed when he finds himself in an amorous situation with her, and does not want to be recorded. All the roles are well-played especially by Bonmaire. I think I loved it.	0
Awesome show, but does it bother anybody else that most historical shows always have Brits and their accents? Come on, I'd like to see more Americans in shows that are taped, produced and marketed here, call it a plea for the actors I know here. In reality if America is the modern likeness of Rome then it makes much more sense as well. I wonder what the Romans would sound like? Maybe Italian/Greek accent seems feasible. Anyways it's a good show, I just get sick of the whole British thing.	0
This is a very interesting concept.  It is general psychic-type information given via electronic technology to a man who shares it to stop it or change the outcome.  While the information comes through very similar as it does to a psychic, it can also be very specific.  Still, the problems with interpretation become evident.  It involves human flaws, the growing awareness of possible multiple interpretations, and a chance to make a difference.  How does this affect ego, awareness of perception, government control, and more.  I enjoyed all of these shows.	0
First one I've watched of Inspector Morse.  I guess he is the older version of Endeavor Morse - hard to tell.  I enjoyed this very much.  I have Amazon Prime so wasn't used to having to rent or buy, so I accidentally rented like Season 5 episode 1 rather than Season 1.  But guess that's okay.I will definitely be watching the rest of the seasons.  Good shows.  Also I like the cute younger version of Inspector Lewis.  Very handsome as he is in the later Inspector Lewis series.  GREAT SHOWS ALL.	0
Monk's 8th and final is just as hilarious and entertaining as the previous seasons. Adrian Monk is still miserable and continues to help Captain Stottlemeyer and Disher with solving murders, with the help of his devoted Assistant, Natalie. Throughout this season, Monk serves as a bodyguard for his favorite actress, investigate a UFO sighting, goes undercover as a Mafia boss, celebrates his Birthday, receives a surprising visit from Sharona Fleming, and finally solves the murder of his wife, Trudy. It all comes down to this. I highly recommend MONK: SEASON EIGHT!!!	0
Stargate Universe has a fine cast and fine acting.  The first season portrays the blowup of a planet and the hurried departure of an ancient starship from said planet with scientists and visitors aboard, and the troubles attendant on the Destiny because it has apparently been travelling a long time without any crew and therefore without any maintenance. Various solutions are found but there are also conflicts among the people aboard, since some are scientists, some military and some just folks.  It is a good beginning to the four-season journey.Linda Sheean	0
I am giving this show five stars---I'm actually on the third season and I still love it. You do feel like you are being conned sometimes, because the plots don't work, and they hope you don't notice.  But it is sooooo good otherwise, I have to go with a full five stars.  The characters are rich and believable and adorable. The characterization details in the dialogue are amazing. The con details are interesting.  There's no gross yuk stuff---like dead bodies staring at you.  I hate that! It's really a great show!	0
I had never seen Doctor Who before this year. I was browsing instant videos and thought I would see why this show has been so popular for so many years. I have now watched seasons 1 through 4 (of the new series) and have started season 5. I love this show.Travelling through time with the Doctor and his companion is a real treat. It seems like there is something for every one - adventure, aliens (some scary, some not), love stories, intriguing story lines and a great cast of actors. Enjoy!	0

I watched all of the episodes of this series, mainly because of Damian Lewis.  I saw him in Band of Brothers playing an American Officer in the 82nd Airborne Screaming Eagles. (seems we don't have any American actors to play these parts-guess we have a talent shortage here in the colonies).  He is a good actor and the writing of the series was great, with a great gimmick for the main character.  I think they cancelled this series too early.  It could have been better given time to work out the kinks.	0
iCarly is a good show the entire family can watch; this show is enjoyed by all of the kids in my neighborhood up to about 8th grade.  The jokes are pretty funny and what I really like the most as a parent is the show doesn't cross the line like a lot of children-focused shows seem to do with being a tad risqu&eacute;.We have watched all of the episodes of this season for free via our Prime membership vs. the regular price of $24.99 for the whole season: not a bad deal!	0
I started watching this because Steven King recommended it and I like Steven King novels so he pulls a lot of weight in my book. Well I'm hooked! You won't fall asleep watching these shows. Fast and continuous action are what keep me glued to the set or tab.  My wife thinks I'm crazy. Don't get caught up with facts and details just sit back and enjoy.  Not for the weak of heart. It's adrenalin pumping action that will definitely raise the blood pressure.Lots of foul language and violence so be aware.	0
I bought season one THE GLADES on spec, to see if I liked it.  I do like it.  It's not awesome television, but for me the characters are interesting and the writing is pretty good.  When season two came out I bought that too.  I have a weakness for police procedurals.  I'll probably buy season three THE GLADES.  There is a good writing team behind this series, and the actors know their stuff.  Not sure if I will ever re-watch any episodes, but hell, I never re-read Jack Reacher novels either.  @hg47	0
I was hooked after the first two or three shows. I watched this until seasons end, and waited anxiously to begin season two. What I found was the same story lines over and over. The same disappointments over and over, with the exact same characters.I was also tired of seeing the Christian characters played as WAYYYYY over the top, and the Pagan as wise, calm and all knowing. It got old fast! I watched a little of season three, finding the exact same story line AGAIN! UGH I just couldn't watch anymore.	0
An essay by David Mamet turned me on to George V. Higgins, and, completest that I am, I devoured all his novels.  He is the smartest dialogue writer I have ever read.  Last year's &#34;Killing Them Softly&#34; got the wit, zing, and poetry just right, and the delivery by Brad Pitt and James Gandolfini was  amazing.Robert Mitchum is more realistic in his approach, so, while the dialogue is not delivered with the great timing of Pitt and Gandolfini, his physical presence is completely believable as the low-level mobster, Eddie Coyle.Otherwise, kind of plodding.	0
What would you do during a disaster scenario where information is scarce and everything is headed into a downward spiral? Most likely, try to keep your head above water. That is the premise of Jericho, a smaller city outside of a location that experienced a major nuclear attack. It follows a town as they deal with the likely problems we as a society would face when things turn extremely rough. Sadly, it only lasted for two seasons, meaning at some point the story line will simply drop off, never to be continued. :(	0
Casting could have been better here, as could some of the acting.  The music is nothing great either, and I don't care much for the fellow playing Henry.  The first season drags out all the business with Anne Boleyn, Catherine of Aragon, and Thomas Wolsey, also.The costumes and locations are wonderful, and there is some entertainment to be had.  Apparently the history is inaccurate, though I can't really comment on that since I am not that familiar with the era and people involved.Okay for a cheap rental, but nobody needs to purchase this.	0
What happened was this.....spoilers ahead.......Mr. Monk tore through the sixth season with stronger emotions, even beating up a guy who had something to do with Trudy's death. Dale the Whale returned to try to torment Monk, who had to fake his own death for a while.  Also, Julie Teeger got more screen time as she blossomed into a teenager, while Randy Disher was given more attention as well.  The captain continues to maintain a strong presence on the show, and so does Natalie.  Dr. Kroger holds his own.I missed Monk's brother Ambrose, though.	0
In the pilot, the look and feel of this show does for the Bionic Woman, what they did for Battlestar on the Sci-Fi channel( if not quite as gritty). Where as the original was just silly, this seems (so far) as a well thought out story, with people that we may come to care about for (good or ill).The subplots, of Jamie's reletionships with her sister, and evil crazy counterpart, for me (at least so far) make for good drama.They've got my interest, I just hope the show lives up to the pilot.	0
The show started off as intriguing and has developed into a very solid drama. It has potential to really excel and become one of the best new dramas, but needs more time to develop. Unfortunately, the writers' strike may have a negative effect on the show's future. I am truly impressed with the fairly accurate representation of the Bay Area both historical and present day. There are always a few minor things that get fudged, but, for the most part, it is true to this region. Give it a chance and have fun.	0
After viewing Season One of Life, I immediately went back out on Amazon and purchased Season Two. Great intelligent entertainment - sometimes dark, sometimes funny, sometimes darkly funny.  Damian Lewis is the perfect Charlie.  And I've been an Adam Arkin fan since first seeing him on West Wing, so it was good to see him in a meatier role, one which gave room to show more of his fine talent.I'm stingy with stars, so four stars is very good, per my rating system.  A bit more edge would have earned five stars from me.	0
"""Mad Men"" is great and I've watched three seasons of it, but ""Breaking Bad"" is phenomenal (and I've only just gotten started).  In fact, this could be one of the best shows ever.  Seven fantastic episodes kicked off by the pilot-to-end-all-pilots.  The only lull in the season is when Walter White's family has a long intervention with him about why he doesn't want to get chemotherapy.  Don't get me wrong, it's not a bad scene, but it's blown away by every other scene in the show.  Bryan Cranston does a great job, as usual."	0
For the most part, the show is enjoyable.  However, everything to do with Katey Sagal's character screams drama (more than is needed).  I guess that is how they want to play it.  She does a great job, but it is a bit much, if that isn't what you are looking for.  I was never much for over done drama (same thing that made or broke Battlestar Galactica, for the most part), thats why they have daytime soaps.  Again, good show and its worth watching, you just might have to struggle through some of it.	0
I didn't realize until I was 15 minutes into the first episode that it was filmed in Canada. I haven't watched all of season 1, but I have watched enough to know it is a very tight drama.  Characters are fantastic and believable.  I do like that they finish each story while continuing to develop the main characters a little at a time.  I was also surprised to see it was on TV for 5 seasons.  Hmm, well missing it then is making it a great way to catch up now.  Well worth watching.	0
I am a dinosaur when it comes to TV.  There are so few TV shows today that I like.  The format for today's shows bores me.I still use an antenna and had never seen this show. When it was syndicated a friend told me I had to watch it.  I was hooked immediately!  What a great show!  The writing is excellent, the cast is brilliant.  Whoever cast that show deserves an award!  Since I don't have cable I have not seen Season 5 yet and can't wait for it to come out on DVD.	0
How depressing. I'm tired of all these unsolved missing person cases with no resolution. I've seen too many of these sorts of mysteries and want a show about all the people that are found and how the detectives or whoever was involved went about it. The police should bring in a good psychic in some of these seemingly hopeless cases. They might be able to help. I feel terrible for the families and friends who suffer this terrible unsolved loss and it's just too upsetting to watch anymore. My heart goes out to them.	0
This is a great show, but I do not get the BBC channel out here in the sticks where I live so my Amazon Prime membership is perfect for me to watch all the shows I love but never get to see on TV. Now with Amazon Prime I can watch through my PC in my bed room, my Wii on my Family Room TV, and my son has an internet ready TV that he can watch what he wants on. I love this show and I love love love my Amazon Prime membership.	0
Helen Mirren was especially good in this series.  She is elevated to the position of lead detective after the death of the former.  She is the first female to hold this position and is not accepted as competent to lead by the squad.  She proves them wrong after working the case and solving the murders.This is a show that women will love.  It proves that given a chance. they are as competent as the men and very devoted to getting the job done.The acting is especially good and the suspense builds throughout the episodes.	0
A brilliant rendition on the Stargate theme, Universe,-Not unlike Terminator: The Sarah Chronicles-burned with an emotional flame thats just out ofspectrum with the folks mainlining their T.V.People seem to have difficulty when conflict andprogression are described in more than 10 emotional states.I'm going to leave he last episode unwatched andadd the suggestion as I did with the Terminatorfranchise- Not that much time has passed and theactors can still pick up without a hitch. Do it.Hell, I'd produce it. Or at least Book It from the endof the show which for me continues on paper...	0
The things I have enjoyed about House are still present in the fifth season of the show. The character drama is handled extremely well, the acting is top notch, and all around this season has some incredibly solid episode. While not every episode is a hit and some of the storylines don't feel quite right, this is a very stable season that is easily 4 stars. This is by far one of the most unique medical dramas ever and it's a testament to the show's quality that it can stay interesting even after 100 episodes.	0
I used to love this show when it first premiered and have been a faithful follower throughout all its many seasons. Having said that I feel that the antics of Dr. House are getting a bit tiresome and I am waiting for either Dr. Wilson or someone else to punch him in the face. The storyline remains the same, a medical mystery is presented at the beginning of the show and the rest of the show is devoted to the eventual solution. I will watch it to the end but the writing has to improve.	0
It could be my Indian upbringing but for some reason I always feel at home when I watch Robin Williams. It could be the kindness in his eyes or the fragrance his happiness illuminates but he truly is a remarkable actor. In WGD, he does prove to me that even at 59, he remains one of the world's greatest actors.This film is for the morally tweaked, definitely not for those who live by calling everything mundane. It's funny, it's teary, it's funny, it is my film of the month. Do watch and share the word.	0
I like this movie because although there was plenty of blood and guts, there was some story there too. It was not formulaic, not too &#34;Hollywood.&#34; I especially like the opening and closing line being the same (which I won't spoil for you by quoting it!) Very clever, I liked the writing and the main character is easy to root for, certainly.  It's one I don't mind watching more than once, so I bought it! It's a go-to movie for me when I need to unwind. Hope you enjoy it as much as I do.	0
By third season I think that I was just along for the ride, Heroes always &#34;looked&#34; good but always fell short of its potential, at least this one rises above what Season Two was turning itself into. If you like scifi / fantasy you can find some good bits here, but the &#34;bargain bin&#34; might still be the way to go. My set advertises &#34;over 20 hours of bonus features&#34;- that would be the best reason to watch this season ( and even that doesn't explain dropping so many second season characters like Claire's flying boyfriend).	0
Clich&eacute; after clich&eacute; after clich&eacute;, does not deliver. Not even randomly. The procedural is just so bad that it could have worked as a joke, but it instead tries to be too serious. The writing is painful Of the two main characters, she is as stiff, boring, and sanctimonious as the worst parody of a career woman attempts to be. He is a clown disguised as what I guess was meant to be a New York yuppie with suits and sneakers, bear, and hat. The love story is without chemistry. Naturally. The episodes plots are lame.	0
I had never heard of this show until I signed up for Amazon Prime and started watching it on Prime instant video.  I fell in love with the show and the characters.  I am really very sad that they have cancelled it.  I could watch it for hours every day and never get tired of it.  It seems like every show I ever find that is an interesting quality show they have to cancel  I'm sure there are a lot more sci-fi fans out there that are upset about this.  Here's wishing they would bring it back!!	0
I didn't think I would be interested - another 'gang-glorifying' theatrical event. For some reason I watched a couple of episodes late one night, and now I am hooked. Even though it contains many of the gang glorifying elements (killing - just because it suits gang needs, lawlessness, drugs sex and guns along with demeaning of people in general and women in particular), there are intriguing characters, great acting, interesting and complex relationships, and also tackles issues on integrity on the legal side as well as the gang. I'm hooked and will probably watch all the episodes.	0
"Ray Winstone (you may recognize him from the movie ""Sexy Beast) is Vincent, the head of his own P.I. firm. He is assisted by his small crew of associates. Vincent may appear to be a tough guy, and he can be. He delivers tough news with directness, yet ultimately has a heart of gold. He takes on cases that often have excellent plots and the interaction and caring of his staff is wonderful. This is a mystery/drama above all else, but can be funny and touching at the right times. I only wish there were more episodes."	0
This re-make of the classic series Bionic Woman is not as wretched as some would like to say. Overall it suffers from a slightly dull athmosphere, and it is true that the writing could have been tighter but the acting is rather good and the effects are first-rate even if they are somewhat in the background. So the story is quite simple, underachieving bartender Jamie Summers is almost killed during an accident and re-built by her experimental-surgeon boyfriend. Afterwards it is quite straightforward. But as I wrote it is not as bad as some other reviewers put it.	0
This Canadian series holds onto its excellence in the release of season two. The name flashpoint refers to some event which brings a person to snapping and taking the law into his own hands.  That person is also about to do something awful, such as kill other people.  This squad has to do one of two things, either calm the person down until he surrenders to them OR kill the person before he can harm others. They are all excellent marksmen plus skilled in calming down people who have hit the flashpoint.  The series is set in Toronto.	0
"Yep.  I thought that House M.D. Season 4 was absolute dreck.  Just hated it.  But, I'm an avid fan of Hugh Laurie and medical dramas so I couldn't resist checking out Season 5.I can't say I'm loving the personal storylines--House/Cuddy romance, Cuddy/Baby Mama--but I'm still totally diggin' on the medical mysteries!  Even more, I enjoy that the original characters that drew me in--Foreman, Chase, and Cameron--play a more significant role than they did in Season 4.If you didn't enjoy the ""Survivor"" gimmick of Season 4, give Season 5 a chance.  You'll remember why you loved to hate House."	0
"Joe and the bots are put through a grueling ordeal w/ LOST CONTINENT. They hang on for dear life during the interminably-long ""mountain climbing"" sequence that consumes nearly half the movie's running time w/ climbing... Climbing... CLIMBING! A dinosaur (aka: a tiny lizard filmed from below) is glimpsed, but even it leaves out of boredom. Finally, a stop-motion brontosaurus lumbers forth, only to be filled w/ lead! So little action takes place, that Joel nearly lapses into a coma! Luckily, through the wonders of MST3K technology, this film is rendered (nearly) harmless. Let us thank these brave lads..."	0
"Life is my favorite show of the season.It is well acted, well written, with a fascinating and original premise.The show is full of philosophy, i.e. mans search for meaning and justice.Add to that a couple of beautiful actresses thrown into the mix, and ""Life"" is a thinking man's perfect show!03/01/08I just rewatched all the pre stike episodes this week...And again, I think this is the best drama of the year and one of the best ever on TV. If you haven't seen this show yet, do yourself a favor and start at the beggining and get addicted like me."	0
interesting from the start. i am not typcially a fan of any sort of cop show, but this one was so good i cannot wait for the next episode. bought the season pass before it was even half over.the writing here is particularly good for network tv. this show could easily have been on hbo. i just hope nbc doesnt drop the ball on this one. judging from the rest of the slate available so far, this is the only one that isnt insulting and stupid. indeed its grand, nuanced and wonderful. and as i said, very very smert.	0
I like this TV show but it does get a little old watching David's character as an overly sexual playboy who keeps up the bad habits. I'm wondering when they will introduce the episode where he catches HIV at some point. I have watched a few old girlfriends from San Francisco die because of guys like his character.  Anyway, its entertaining. Also, the male behavior in the TV show reminds of the lifestyle and mentality of a lot of men in L.A. and San Francisco which is interesting, BUT it does get old too. Its like...really??? Gross! Grow Up!	0
If you saw CATCH ME AS YOU CAN starring Leo DiCaprio as the king of the white collar criminals, this series, WHITE COLLAR, is loosely based on that premise.  This time, however, everyone is fictional.  The two partners are an FBI agent and the con man in the white collar section.  This is as much breezy comedy as it is crime drama. This episode has the two of them working on an Iraqi stolen artifacts problem.  It is not earth shattering tv but it is good and entertaining.  With some work and in time, it might become even better.	0
Just, how screwed up can one family be?  This documentary seems to portray a fictional family, that is routinely involved with every degrading, unscrupulous, vindictive, vile, inhumane and disgusting trait that anyone can possess - but it's real!  You can't call this extended family &#34;the other half&#34; because &#34;the other half&#34; could never conceive of a lifestyle that barely hangs onto the threads of our collective humanity.  The Whites are, however, such an interesting and unusual mix that I was entertained, beyond belief.  I'm not particularly a Johnny Knoxville (Jackass Movies) fan but this documentary certainly kept my attention.	0
"I was pleasantly surprised with this ""out of the box"" series.  Good writing, good acting, laugh out loud situations.  Devito showing up in the second season gave it a little boost as he's always dependable for turning the mundane into the hilarious.It's basically about 3 jackass friends in Philly who own a bar and get themselves into offbeat situations.  What I liked best is that it is not the clice venue for the young and the beautiful.  It often hi-lightes the old and the ugly and in doing so cultivates a good portion of the laughs.Worth you time and money....bg"	0
I heard about It's Always Sunny from a Kevin Smith Smodcast. If you haven't been force-fed the usual formula comedycrap replete with obnoxious laugh tracks, you might just like it.It's not a continuous knee-slapper but just some good ol' off-center comedy. Welcome back Danny DeVito - sure he's doing the same ol' DePalma character, but I STILL think it's funny. For me, it's another one of those sit down and plow through a DVD at a time. I would never have had the patience to watch these one at a time on the tube when it aired (that's just me).	0
I am 50 and not in the majority demographic, but I have a teenager and I love watching Veronica mars. I envy her and her fathers relationship. I envy her father for having a teenager that is so together.Anyway, I loved the show, did not watch it while it was on. Binge watched on amazon, then watched this movie on amazon too. Great concept for delivering the film to fans.I think any casual or serious fan of the show would get their money's worth with this. It gave me a warm fuzzy feeling. It was very loyal to the series.	0
Curious George, I think it is a wonderfully done cartoon. The imagery and artwork is beautifully done. The pace is exciting without being too overstimulating and frazzling like many of the other kids shows on today. The color, the selection scheme is aesthetic, not gaudy and tacky as are some of others. The Yellow hat character and others are charming and the show is overall respectful and informative add on shows great respect and forgiveness for George. We love the reality segments as well. Curious George is just so darn cute and the show superbly done. The kids love it.	0
Little Bear and his friends - Owl, Duck, Cat, etc. are lovable and cute - the stories are engaging and make for fun viewing for little ones. Little Bear is one those kids' shows that you don't feel guilty letting your young child watch - it has good language, endearing characters that appeal to young children, and good production values without over-loud music and garish colors.The language is clean, and the characters, i.e. Little Bear and friends, are truly endearing. My first-grader loved watching the episodes when she was three. This is a good production for young children. Highly recommended!	0
this game is realy cool its a little hard at times but still very fun the game has great graphics this game can be very frustrating but still my faverite mystery game works great on the kindle fire.COOL GAME!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!	1
ok, I know its just random, but it seems like its reading my mind. I asked if I was going to shake again, knowing i was going to, and tada! it said a full-on yes. also, I asked, does so-and-so like me? and it said definately not. a shook again, asking, are you sure? and it said, yes.  it also has over 35 answers from what I gather. one of the greatest apps EVER!!!-Stephan&iexcl;e Frost.	1
I'm loving the negative  comments from &quot;experts.&quot; M.D.s don't get mad about the x-ray apps, so why are you mad about this?Most of the comments have shown that people aren't REALLY taking this seriously, so why are you?Lighten up. This is a fun app to have for Halloween.By the way, if you could provide proof that your custom home-made equipment works better than this app, I'm sure we'd all love to see it. No, I didn't think so.	1
Great as a solitaire.  Only problem is trying to keep a continuous score.  You cannot press ok and then leave the game.  Just leave the game.  When you come back your score will be there.  If you press okay.  The next time you play the game will be set at zero.  Was able to get it up to 1000 wins, but don't know if that's all you can go, or if I pressed ok by mistake.  Trying again.	1
After entering my FL Zip Code, the data that appeared is in Hamilton, IN.  And, there seems to be no way/nobody to contact at Zillow when you see a &#34;problem&#34;.  Other issues include incorrect values of properties and listing of sale of my residence since I have been living here???  No way was my property sold to anyone but me!  Also, recent sale $ of property in my neighborhood is incorrect!?  Can't use this app since it's not reliable.	1
Game is good... Probably would give it a 4 based on an honest assessment.  It's well done, but not awesome.I could care less about colorblind mode and certainly wouldn't rate the game down for not having it.  If I was colorblind, I'd just email the dev and see if he might include it with an update.And Superman75 is humorous, but inconsistant.  Last month he was a disgruntled Jew, and this month he's in a cult on a mountain.  Whatever -	1
it kept giving me battery, life, eviction, and dog, and I couldn't figure it out.  finally, after turning on the radar, I saw the phone point to itself.  I ran to my local church, and had the priest do an exorcism on my phone, and sure enough, after the excorcism, my phone battery now lasts twice as long.  on a side note...I knew that yappy dog next door was posessed, and after shooting it with holy water, it burst into flames.	1
I think it's a very competently designed app, which would be invaluable if I didn't already have a good web browser and access to Dictionary.com's webpage.  While it does have a few features, not available on the website, none seem necessary to me.  As such, I feel it's a very good app, but not a good match for my personal needs - I've since uninstalled it, to free up resources.  However, for many other folks, it might indeed be very worthwhile.	1
"I really expected more from this app.  Wish I could get my money back.  Seems very incomplete , especially for the price tag.I hate this app!!!!!  Total waste of money.  Wanted to set up a budget, track spending etc. and I cant even get the dang thing to give me a correct balance!!!!  No instructions, no HELP offered, No headings or ""clues"" about what to do, or what not to do.  DONT BUY THIS APP UNLESS YOU HAVE MONEY TO BURN!!!!!!!!"	1
After installing this app on a Samsung Galaxy S3, my battery power significantly decreased so much that my phone couldn't even make it through the work day. I uninstalled, the app, and my battery usage returned to normal.  So I installed a new battery in my phone and re-installed this app.  Again, battery power took a nosedive. And again, I uninstalled it.  I really would like to use this app, but it is doing something in the background that drains the battery.	1
I haven't seen any reviews that include this, so I'll edit if I figure out a way to avoid this. When you die in the game, you start over. Not the level, no... the entire game. Back to the first dungeon. Also, apparently I have to be very careful about hitting quit, otherwise your progress won't be saved. Other than those two issues I have, the game is fun. I feel a little helpless when I can't find a new word though.	1
For those that don't have a police scanner and like to make sure things are ok in your neighborhood this is the app for you. And hey its mobile and FREE!!!!  You just select your county and walah.....you have info for what's happening with the police, fire department,  and the EMT 's. And you will be the first to know of anyone you know is in trouble....going to jail,  being pulled over, accident,  and on and on. Enjoy it. Love You Love Nora	1
Okay, so I downloaded it and turned it on.  At first there was nothing happening but then it started lighting up all over the place. I was watching &quot;Moby Dick&quot; with the volume up high. It said, &quot; look&quot;, &quot; letter&quot;, &quot;auithor&quot;, &quot;funny&quot; and &quot;William&quot;. I turned the volume off and asked,&quot; William who?&quot; No response so far although a hurricane warning from msnbc did pop up while I was typing this and scared the crap outta me. This is so cool. Hehehe!	1
EasyMoney is pretty easy and intuitive and more importantly, it's reliable.  No big bugs to report.  I used to use Splashmoney on my old PalmPilot.  It was great.  I was going to buy the version for the Kindle Fire, but saw more than one really bad review.  So, I looked around and saw that EasyMoney had some pretty good reviews.  Once I finish putting in my budgets, and set up my regular transfers and payments, I think I will find EasyMoney very useful.	1
I've played this on my android phone and really liked it, so when i got my kindle fire hd I immediately purchased it here. But it's missing the auto fill and auto pencil feature, for some reason, that's in the Play store version. Why??? I don't know. But I don't like not having it.I've since uninstalled this version and side-loaded the other company's version which works flawlessly on  the Fire with all the features. This is another failure for the Amazon app store.	1
"My husband and I have a wooden Go board, and we have been playing for many years.  Even so, I am not very good at it.  This app not only teaches me some good strategy and lets me practice, but it also lets me set the ""level"" that I want to play.  I love this app!  I would recommend it for anyone that is interested in learning the game AND for anyyone that already knows how to play and is looking for some competition!!!"	1
App worked when when I first got it.  Now, even after the update it doesn't work properly.  Pace, steps, calories, and distance never calculate properly.  I've tried putting it in my back and front pockets to no avail.  Only time I get any calculation is when I put it in a side pocket on my capris and it's bouncing back and forth.  Voice output doesnt speak anymore, either.  Love the concept and all the features, overall great app...If only it worked properly!  (original Droid)	1
This is fun game worth the download.  It is free after all.  Very low-budget look to it but still fun.  Inconsistent as far as how challenging the levels are but not a huge deal.  For example, I will blow through like 10 levels in 5 minutes but then randomly get stuck on one for forever.  And then after that one a bunch more easy ones.  To me the game seems to easy but I still play it.  And it still gets 5 stars from me.	1
"This app is perfect for those times when you're totally stumped on a crossword.  You enter the letters you have and question marks for the blanks, and it will give you a list of possible words.  Clicking on a word will show the definition.  Doesn't work for proper names, unfortunately, nor does it work if the answer is multiple words (e.g. ""peanutbutter"").  May return a huge list of words if you have too many blanks.No ads!  Huzzah!Works great on both the Evo and the Xoom."	1
I don't like this game very much, they have words that you don't even know. I bought this app because I wanted something fun to do. I did a few games and I noticed it had kind of hard words. I had it on the setting, animals, and it had kind of animals I didn't even know. If you're someone with a large vocabulary then you would love this app. But if you're someone who is.a super genius then I wouldn't recommend this app. e	1
I Love my music so much, and this app after being updated is one of the best ever now!!. You will simply love all the options and free music, and channels it has. You name it, it's in here: Talk, rock, sports, the list goes on forever!!. This is the ITunes app for kindle fire. I love it and hope you will too, but never forget: Life is EZ, when you SEEK, for all your (Must Have) apps, and information.. Dont delay, rock today!!!.. :-)	1
One of the most useful and frequently used apps on my fire HD. It has easily understandable sections for breakfast,lunch dinner, and snacks and will set your daily calorie allowance once you enter weight,height etc.It also helps to track how many calories you use and has a wide database of calorific values of food from U.K. supermarkets.The whole concept is simple and easy,one word of caution maybe,if you don't want to count calories then this isn't' for you but otherwise YOU HAVE to get it.	1
I was looking for game with large cards and realistic play. I finally found it! This game rocks!  Lots of action even without in app purchases. Side bets available. Log in bonus every 4 hours with additional bonuses available. When I reached about $5000, I was offered the opportunity to become a member of the exclusive club for FREE! I was awarded an additional $2500 bucks plus even larger log in bonus! Yahoo! Can't wait to see what other opportunities present themselves!  LOVE this game!	1
I've tried a number of Sudoku apps and never quite been satisfied until I played Enjoy Sudoku. It's got it all - consistent difficulty modes, intuitive and efficient interface, great highlighting, and an incredible hint/tutorial system. A great game for any skill level - it'll help and tutor you to discover all the complicated strategies if you get stuck.There is a free version where you can play the daily puzzle at each difficulty as a trial; the unlimited puzzle generation is awesome and well worth it.	1
I like using this app while shopping just to make sure I can't get a better price elsewhere.  If I can, then I order it from Amazon right there on my phone in whatever store we're shopping at. Sometimes, the prices are better in store, so this app helps me feel like I'm getting the best deals on what I'm shopping for.  It's good to also check reviews on the fly to make sure I'm buing something worth my while.  This one is a must-have app.	1
I immediately turned on this app once I downloaded it. I believe in spirits. Plus... STOP CALLING THEM GHOSTS! I don't know why, but I feel like I'm disrespecting them when I call them ghosts. So I call them spirits. Anyway...A red dot showed up at the very top of the screen. It looked like it was pointing at the house across our street. Then, it said &quot;MARK&quot;. That freaked me out, because a few years ago, a guy named Mark used to live in that house.	1
The WiFi Analyzer works great on my Kindle Fire. There's not much to it. One look and I got the info I need. But I use it whenever I enter a business just to see if there's any wifi around. If I see nothing on the graph then I know there's no wifi. It also can do it in a parabola-type graph so you can see which wifi source is the strongest if there's more than one. I like having it, so I'm going to keep it.	1
I've read that because this is a HD version it cannot be played on the first or second generation kindle fires. It actually can. I own more than one HD game and its just as clear as any other game. Now as far as the game goes: it's alright nothing great but not horrible. It's basically a matching game that gets harder as you move along. Kills time but I've played better. And the totem that &quot;talks&quot; to you is neither creepy or cute is straight annoying.	1
I am a former busy amateur radio enthusiast, but about the only thing I do with my radio now is to listen to police, fire, and other channels.  This device is SO much better than using my radio.  If I can't find something in my own area, I can listen into channels in so many other places where they are always busy.  I am very glad I got this item, and I recommend it to everyone else to pay the small price for some very good entertainment.	1
This game is OK for when you are trapped in a queue and you are sick of people-watching, but the game is a bit of a bore.  It works well and I understand why it is full of ads (stuff has to be paid for somehow) and it is a free app. but I became tired of this almost on day one.  Something about the colours is a bit icky in my opinion.  But it was free so I appreciate having the chance to try it out.	1
"I have a Kindle Fire HD 8.9.  This app has some nice features and one that doesn't work for me.  Under Settings I should be able to ""Filter channels"" so that I can scroll through only those channels in which I am interested instead of all 542 of them (similar to the Comcast Favorites feature).  This feature works for a while then loses my input and I am back to scrolling through 542 channels.  I'll put this app on the back burner until they get this issue resolved."	1
This is really nice! :)) Me and.my family were in the living room...my dad.on his laptop, my sister playing around and watching the movie at the same time, my mom watching the movie too, while me... I was searching for apps as usual. it was 5:50 so it was kinda dark outside and the lights were off inside in our living room si ot looks nicer watching. I just got this app and when I opened ot one word came up and said darkness! :))) A must-have!! :))))	1
This is the first wi-fi analyzer I downloaded, but being curious, I downloaded a few more, but this is the best of the bunch. It has the most features and the easiest to understand features. I even paid for one of the other ones that I downloaded because it had pretty pictures, and it was the most worthless. This wi-fi analyzer is now my most useful app. It continues to amaze me how wildly a signal will vary, especially if it is a so-so signal to begin with.	1
"This ""Moon Phase"" app has a lot of nice features, showing the current phase of the moon in your location and has a calendar function to show the phase on any given day, forward or back in time. Besides making good ""Wallpaper"", this is great for planning star gazing nights since you can see if the moon is going to be bright. The ""Cheese Mode"" is fun, but I will not be using it regularly.The app installs and runs perfectly on my HTC EVO and Kindle Fire.Highly Recommended!CFH"	1
Now that I'm officially retired, I need to get serious about budgeting.  This is billed as 'easy',  but there are no instructions and I'm a babe in the woods with this stuff.  I never could put a budget together - only create categories but found no way to put a $ figure in.  Where I accidently did (how??) I could not put in cents.Now I have to figure out a way to return it and get my $10 back.Not easy at all.  Needs a help or how-to option.	1
It has a good selection of genres and stations.  I like country and bluegras primarily.  I found many of the stations I prefer in the lists it had.  We also follow sports.  It has a pretty good selection of these as well.As with most radio programs it can be a bit choppy while it is buffering.  I did not see much to help configure it to reduce the chopiness.  Maybe I missed it.  If it is not there adding some buffer managment and other tolls would be appeciated.	1
I like this game-yet it seems lacking to me. I would like to see more of a range offered for betting...can you tell yet that I'm conservative and would rather stick with a boring bet of $10 a hand versus a jump up to $50 a hand?! A good waste of time though - and the price was right. Too long to wait for more free betting money*and yet I refuse to pay to play. Buying that Angry Bird eagle twice for one game was enough for me!!!	1
For playing sudoku, this is a good game - a nice variety of difficulty levels, and an unlimited supply of games (in practical terms, at least).For me where this shines is in the hints.  I've been playing Astraware Sudoku (on another platform) for years, and on the highest difficulty levels, always got to a point where I guessed which number an open pair represented with pencilmarks, backtracking if I picked the wrong number.  With Enjoy, I'm using the hints to learn how to use logic tricks instead of guesswork.	1
Amazon, I've always loved my kindle. I still love my kindle. But the phone app preinstalled with no sign of upgrade or remedy crashes constantly, bringing up an annoying box I have to close.. In the middle of whatever I do. I didn't open the app, I didn't strain it's capabilities.. I couldn't even download a book I own .. Or even my library titles the only time I ever tried to use you weeks ago. What gives?????Please figure it out and get back to being my reading companion.	1
"It's simple, It's dice... It's one of the best apps I've downloaded. It works fast and accurately on my lower end tablet and the interface is simple, but attractive. I love the musical tones when you ""hold"" a die and I love the sound when you ""roll"" the dice. The ability to change the colors of the game just adds to its appeal for me. I'm rocking my own little pink game of yahtzee AS I TYPE THIS. Then I'm going to head over and buy the paid version."	1
"I know the description says ""not compatible with Droid"", but one reviewer said it ran fine on his Droid Bionic, so I figured I'd try.  Big mistake - the app ran really slow, then even slower, then hung the phone completely. The only recourse at that point was too pull the battery and restart.  Some may think one star is unfair, given that the app is merely (not) performing as advertised, but there's really no excuse for this kind of behavior on one of the most popular Android platforms."	1
I have absolutely no reason to know what the moon phase is, but I downloaded this app because of the Live Wallpaper function.I'm always looking for cool new wallpapers, and this one is definitely cool.  The graphics for the moon are superb, and as a background it simply looks amazing.When it comes to the rest of the app, I don't really know much about moon phases, but it seems to be solidly written and works very well.Overall, for what I'm using it for, it's definitely a five star app.	1
Have enjoyed this for about two weeks now. Makes it so easy to keep track of everything from food,exercise & yard work! Its very easy to find homemade versions of foods and prepackaged versions. Some of the exercises I do with my trainer aren't in the list but I'm able to put in 90% of them. My hubby & I are friends on the app so its cool that we get to keep track of each others progress throughout the day. Looking forward to much success with this app!	1
This app does what it is supposed to. If you want to check the listings its great for that, it doesn't do much else. I would have liked to have maybe show previews. It works well on the Kindle Fire with no issues. It definitely saves the trouble of going through the listings, it's a quick and easy way to find what you are looking for and get a reminder of what's coming up. Basic and functional. I would recommend if basic and functional is what you are looking for.	1
"This free ""Scanner Radio"" app installed cleanly on my Kindle Fire HD and worked perfectly for my needs. The app does not turn your device into a radio but it does allow you to listen to Internet streaming of local government radio communications (police, EMS, etc). If your local service does not stream there communications, you will not be able to listen to them with this app.The interface was fairly easy to navigate and I was lucky to find that my local law enforcement's communication was available through the app.Recommended!CFH"	1
I wanted an ap like this to listen to when I don't have access to my scanner, but this won't work because it doesn't offer any of the frequencies that I like to monitor. I only offers a selective group of frequencies, and they are not in my city! It's OK for what it is, and might be fun to listen to is you want to learn some of the radio codes used by law enforcement, but it doesnt replace a real scanner that can be programmed to your liking.	1
This is a novelty app with potential but is in way ready for release. Seems almost random as to whether it'll work from one phone to the next.On my own, a stock mytouch 4g, it sometimes works with the rear camera, sometimes doesn't. I've yet to get the flash to work at all, and despite it having the option fort the front camera it never worked.All in all it feels like an app that was never fully tested and was never ready for release.It really should be called a beta.	1
I have the parking lot game,different development team, that would play on my phone and tablet. Unforantly the graphics were poor on the ten inch screen. The author of this game did a great job on improving the graphics in this version.  Ironically my phone is a Droid Razr so per the developer's comments, I can only play this on my tablet and play the other version on my phone. Overall it is great game regardless of the eye candy and I highly recommend it for all ages. (Toshiba Thrive 3.2.1)	1
I have been using myfitnesspal for several years now...it helps me keep track of what I've been eating so I can look back as a resource...helps keep me on track for good choices & motivates me to work out when I see that maybe I have taken in a few too many calories for the day...so if I work out then I can keep things going smoothly with a workout...this app/website has helped me for years...I have recommended it to many and will continue to do so...LOVE IT! Thank you myfitnesspal!	1
Although I got this free on Amazons Free App of the Day, I would gladly pay the buck for this many puzzles! The game is certainly fun &amp; addicting, no bones about it.I especially appreciated its thorough game settings &amp; instructions on how to play in the Menu. Many game apps lack this, making it difficult to play them.For those asking why &quot;the permissions&quot;? It's for sharing of your high scores online,  IF you chose to do so.If you like strategy type game puzzles then, I recommend giving this one a try.	1
"Another (Must have) for Kindle Fire users. This one has like 5 setting to check out  just about all you need on your wi-fi.. One has a meter thats great to see where are all the Hot Spots at around the house.. You can even add a beep to it do drive everyone nuts!, beep!!!  beep!, lol. Fallow my ""review list"" here on amazine to find out whats the Best that other Kindle Fire users are useing. Thats all I put on my list.. Nothing but the best for you.. Enjoy all."	1
I have used Splash ID for years to keep track of my hundreds of passwords and other important information. I have the app on my iPhone 4S, Nexus 2013, iPad 3 and Dell laptop. My laptop serves as the &#34;master list&#34; and it's very easy to sync any of my devices with my laptop to keep track of any additions or changes. I sync via wifi.The app lets you create your own categories and supplies ample fields for all of your information. This is one of my favorite and most used apps.	1
Ok I tried this. Instructions are simple, and plain, but when I tried to move around, it was awkward. Something that will take a few tries. First try, didn't get caught, so I guess I did something right. I give it 4 stars, because its not a top notch game yet. I may Change it as the game continues, when I have time to continue.  Overall, its cute and interesting.Reading reviews of others...just be honest of your gaming experience.  Others may rely on your comment before downloading. And who uses &quot;twit&quot; anymore?	1
This program is outstanding.  I like music and got this so I can hear Music as I use my tablet.  I just typed Japan in the search feature (No reason I could have type Ethiopia but I was not sure of the spelling!) and a list of Japanese listening language) channels appeared.  I selected one and BAM (Like the Chef!) Japanese music started to play like I was there on the Island of Fukuoka in the city of Saga.  I wonder what they were saying during the commercials?  I highly recommend this program.	1
I got this for the free app of the day since it had Shoutcast capabillities. It's smooth, awesome and works well. I recommend it. There are free radio apps that are good, too, but this one seems to run more smoothly and you actually get Shoutcast stations, which are hard to find free like this on Android. Not that this is free now.I like how the search feature searches songs that the stations are playing instead of the station name, but it would be nice if I could search the station name, too.	1
I was always getting spotty wifi at the outer reaches of my house.  this app helped me see that I was sharing the same channel with three other routers.  selecting a channel that wasn't so crouded really helped.I wish there was a indicator explaining that some of the higher channels are for international use and may not currently be enabled on the device running the app. I accidently set my router to one and didn't realize it and spent dome time trying to figure out why my device no longer saw the router.	1
I play this with my 5 year old daughter. Sometimes we take turns on each screen, or we help each other work the screen out. To play, you have to join the objects, with none being left over by the end, and if you get it wrong, you just shake the kindle and the level replays. The only issue I have is that as the level changes, it's not always intuitive what you should do, so there's trial and error involved, but even that is pretty fun. We both really enjoy this game.	1
"The ""ZombieBooth"" app allows you to zombify anyone in a picture, usually with good results. Full face images without cluttered backgrounds are best. The zombie on the screen will react to touching the screen by attempting to bite the finger and static images can be exported and saved.Tried this on a statue in church and, surprisingly, it worked but I got in trouble with my wife so will not be doing that again anytime soon. Still might be fun at a museum...This installed and ran perfectly on my HTC EVO running Android v2.3.3Recommended!CFH"	1
I have HTC Rezound, and I don't know why, but this app does not work. I've updated it, reinstalled it completely and it still will not show my songs. If I flip back and forth (with the buttons) between store and music player/cloud, it will flash the song for half a second (I can see the album art), but there's no way to play it. My music just doesn't show up in the app. My husband also played with it, trying to get it to work, and had no more success than I.	1
&quot;this game took over my home screen!&quot; it's not a game its a live wallpaper, like it says!&quot;uses too much battery. &quot; that's what a live wallpaper does, if you don't like it then don't use it but don't downrate the wallpaper for it.reviews are meant to be a review of the quality of the app.. if you don't understand what it is or what it does then freaking ask before rating.great app, super cute for Halloween. runs well on my myTouch 4G and is way better than most live wallpapers i've used	1
This application is not only great because of it's networking abilities but it also helps by TELLING YOU how many calories are found in the foods you're eating!  You will realize serving sizes & start eating healthier, just because of this app! The information you receive helps you to be a better you! I've already lost 6 lbs. in less than a month & I thank this app for helping to make me aware of my caloric intake!! A little exercise & MY FITNESS PAL encouragement from your friends, goes a LONG WAY!!!!	1
What a rip-off app! I just paid out for more coins and didn't even receive my chips!! Somebody better give me some chips or give me back my coins from Amazon! I thought this was a good application but not no more. This app does not deserve a rating at all but I have been playing it til now. Boy you know how to rip off people! Here is your 1 star rating it doesn't even deserve that rating as far as I am concerned. You better quit cheating people on this app!!!	1
Reviews are better than the app so it was worth the purchase price of zero..Got my money's worth. Gave it a 4 rating because the reviews were soooo funnyMy radar said I had a flat tongue and the police were going to act at the store. That is what I got from : police, store, act, tongue, flat. Love it...great timing for halloween. Don't let it creap you out it's just entertainment. Laugh a little. Keep the cool reviews commingled...oh...wait...incomming...message : Whatever you do give it your all...except when you are giving blood. hahahaha{^_-}	1
Simple voice recording is perfect. It even eliminated the tv sounds which I had playing loud in the background.As far as importing wavs and mp3's, it failed. I went into further testing to see if it would play the first track while I record with it on the second which was the whole reason I paid for the app but it fails again. If you are just looking for a perfect sound  or voice recorder for you tablet, then look no further but as far as recording song and music ideas, look else where.	1
This game tries really hard to be a new spin on pac man, only thing is, pac man did it better and is still going strong after 30ish years. The graphics are mediocre. The controls aren't great. But if you like pac man style games, you may like this, even though it pales compared to the original, and even some good knock offs I've tried. Installed it twice because I really wanted to like it and give it a 2nd chance. But I know I'll never pay it, so I uninstalled it for good.	1
I tried other methods for keeping track of my food intake and exercise. None worked well or smoothly. This product is simple to use and sync with my computer for later printing of reports and graphs. Only improvement I would recommend would be to include more of the equipment typically found in most gyms. When I looked through exercise tab listing I was surprised that it did not include treadmills. That aside, I would recommend this to anyone who hates counting calories but needs a quick tracking device. Works great on the Kindle Fire!	1
Like so many programs out there today, the food database makes little or no sense. Foods are always based on volume even when they should be based on weight. Entering values that can be easily adjusted for later use is a pain (e.g. entering 10 grams and wanting 11 grams the next time because it assumes you are entering a &#34;portion&#34; size). Creating recipes is not bad -- editing them is terrible unless you are on the PC. Basically, the PC version is OK, but the tablet version LEAVES a lot to be desired.	1
I got this app after looking at other people's reviews. I am a total believer when it comes to spirits. According to the radar, I had like 6 ghosts in my house. They started saying stuff that didn't make sense. But seeing those words and looking at the radar scared the s*** out of me. Because I'm a believer, this scared me so badly, I'm afraid to use it again. The only reason I want to use it still is so I can maybe communicate with my dad. Only 4 stars because it's so freaky.	1
This game presents a clean aesthetic where you control a square that must escape the other &#34;evil&#34; squares trying to catch you.  You get some neat powerups that let you destroy them (like the power pellets in Pac-Man) and there are some other puzzle-type elements.  However, after just a few levels you feel as if the game has run out of ideas and you're stuck just playing more difficult versions of the previous levels.  It also tries to present a &#34;story&#34; with quotes from certain other block characters but it all falls a little flat.	1
While it provides some good information and will help you find out how much things are going for in a neighborhood.  It isn't always up to date exactly.  Sometimes a property is sold by the time you check it out and call on it.  Other times, it's off the market.  Some of the photos of the neighborhoods are out of date satellite photos and some new developments that are built out are still showing are bare earth.  All in all, it's a good tool, but caveat emptor, especially in anything to do with real estate.	1
I play on my Kindle Fire and the app is great. the buttons of numbers tell you exactly how much of those numbers are already on board with a small number on the upper right hand side.you can choose your difficulty level and it times you. its awesome and a great way to pass the time. it even highlights the lines for you.if in doubt, try it for yourself. you can always uninstall it.ive had it for a few weeks and it does not crash. no fancy graphics but it's sudoku, there is no need.	1
It works as well as it can on my device. it can be calibrated and it can display gridlines.  it will display the angle a well as the 'bubble' and can also display other units such a in/ft.  it displays full screen on my tablet.  my tablet is a viewsonic gtablet and has aknown issue where the accelerometer axes are not set up as they are in other devices so i can't set up calibration on two sides at once, but I cannot fault the app for that; I need to flash a custom rom. :)	1
I have turned my back on iTunes. This is my music library now. I have this app on my phone and I can download whatever songs I want from my Amazon library. I can download music I've purchased from Amazon or songs I've uploaded (like the songs I imported from my old iTunes. Once the song is on my phone, I can listen even if I'm not in a WiFi area, and it doesn't need my data minutes either. You can sort by artist or album or song or genre, and you can make playlists too.	1
"AFTER USING THE TUNEIN RADIO FREE APP FOR JUST A FEW DAYS ON MY KINDLE FIRE HDX--I COULD HONESTLY-- IMMEDIATELY --TELL YOU THAT IT IS THE BEST THING SINCE BUTTERED BREAD!  IT IS PROBABLY THE BEST APP I HAVE DOWNLOADED FROM AMAZON!  IT IS TERRIFIC!!!  I LOVE LISTENING TO MUSIC AS I WORK-- AND THIS APP IS PHENOMENAL!!  I ONLY HAVE ONE QUESTION: HOW DOES ONE DELETE A ""RECENT"" FROM THE LIST?  IF YOU CLICK ON SOMETHING IN ERROR-- YOU CANNOT GET IT OFF YOUR ""RECENT"" LIST.  GET THIS FREE APP PRONTO!  YOU WILL LOVE IT!!!!!!"	1
This is a fun game. You fly your plane by using the joystick type control at the bottom left of the screen and try shooting using the fire button on the bottom right of the screen. Simple controls. You shoot the planes down that show up and the level progresses in difficulty. There are stars that fall from the sky and they have rewards or not. Sometimes it will freeze your enemies or sometimes it makes you fly slowly. Each star has either a benefit or a curse that only lasts a little while. Fun game.	1
Never in my life did I EVER want to count calories! But with this a lot of what of what i eat is already imputted though other members. I'm starting to enjoy seeing what I'm doing to myself each day. I especially enjoy the pie chart that shows that percentage of carbs, fats, sodium and protiens I'm consuming everyday.  One bad thing, the weight training. I don't know the names of ill the moves I do (Richard Simmons Totally Toning) so j just end up putting less strenuous walking down. Over all I really like it.	1
Entering the food is difficult as it requires a lot of searching to finally find the food that matches what one has eaten - or is about to eat.  Also, the Tracker does not allow me to enter my weight lifting results.  It has the exercises, including the reps, amount of weight, number of sets, but after the form gets filled out it lists each exercise but the calories are not counted.  It is just an entry without a result.  Oddly, it does list and count the results of carido exercises.  Frustrating.So I stopped using it.AD2	1
It's installed, had to cut the lines didn't have a choice for my vehicle.  Happy with this item.  For my vehicle the upper line was the return line to the transmission.  Opposite of what people generally believe.  Adequate adapters were not supplied.  My vehicle has a quick coupler fitting on the radiator.  No adapters were included for that, that's why I had to cut the lines and clamp on to the line.Happy with the item though.  It's working.	2
I gave this 4 stars because it is a great, gentle, all in one protectant.  It performs as promised.  Would not hesitate to get it.  One thing for sure.....  If you want a 5 STAR product, get the KLASSE Sealant/Protectant in the Silver jug.  It is fantastic, and if I was only going to get ONE KLASSE product, it would be the Sealant just mentioned.  The silver bottle!  Red bottle comes in at one step behind.  But both are good.	2
I'm always hesitant to use tire-shine for personal reasons.  They always wear-off and sometimes they are just too shiny.This spray really does the job.  Its non-greasy and shiny.  It makes tires to look BLACK (the fluid is white/cloudy) and as i was applying it to the tires, i could see a difference.  It rained right after i left the carwash and after driving in the rain for 15mins the shine/cleanliness was still there.  So over all i'm super happy with this.	2
This is a good value and it's useful.  It's a one time set up and then hopefully it will help get the job done over and over.  I've purchased two of these.  one for a Pop UP camper I've owned since 2008 and the other for an Airstream camper we acquired in July.  For winterizing I also use the  Camco 36143 RV Blow Out Plug with Brass Quick Connect (http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002XL2IEA/ref=oh_details_o00_s01_i01) also available through Amazon Prime.  These to gadgets make winterizing much easier.	2
I'm a skeptic when a product promises spectacular results with a minimum of effort, but this one delivers!  The light gray interior of my car looks brand new, and it took less than half an hour.  I have leather seats, too.  Finger marks, dust,  insect carcasses, spilled drink stains--all are history.  The only thing it didn't fully remove was a blue ink mark, but even that is lighter.My only regret is that the really lovely rose fragrance didn't linger, but oh, well.	2
A few moths ago, the check engine light of our 2006 (190,000 mile) Volvo V50 came on.  After checking with our local garage, which diagnosed the problem with &#34;something catalytic converter&#34;-related (and hearing the potential repair costs), the mechanic suggested trying this CRC Guaranteed To Pass Emissions Test Formula first.  Well, thus far it appears to have worked.  The check engine light has not been lit for several months now.  As the mechanic explained: &#34;At worst, this product doesn't harm the ergine.&#34;	2
i use this in addition to my built-in RV water filter.  we used it to fill our freshwater tank at home so that we had familiar and clean water at the RV park.  couldn't tell the difference between &#34;RV&#34; water and drinking from home faucet.  CAUTION: be sure to rinse out the carbon before using it--squirt water through the filter and you'll see lots of carbon residue... continue until the water is clear (only a few seconds) and then you're good to go.	2
Bought it April 9th, rebate mailed April 14th.  Today August 20th received $24 for 2 6-pack rebate after numerous phone calls and email scan copies.  Mobil 1 0w-40 is a great product, however their rebate process is way sub par.  I would definitely think twice before such mail-in-rebate deals come up again.  It is just not worth the time and effort for tracking this rebate.  Do yourself a favor, go to your local Wmart to get them for less.  MIR, what a joke.	2
Woo-hoo!  I love these things.  I put two on my 2004 trailer, and am really glad I did!  Really makes coming down stairs a whole lot more secure.  These are super simple to install, with just four screws total.  And, they fold in either direction when towing, meaning that if you've got an awning assembly near your door, you can fold these closed over the door(s)! And, they make your rig look like a movie star trailer (no fooling, someone said that to me)!	2
This car wash cleaned the car very well,but it left water spots. To be fair the car was in the sun and I was talking to someone while I was drying.It was about 75 degrees outside that day and sunny. I washed silver,blue,red and grey colored cars with no problem.I live in NYC and the water is not that hard.A little goes a long way and its very foamy.Works well in the foam gun.Just dry it quickly if your car is black.Otherwise 5 stars!	2
These WORK! I used them with the Meguiar's wax. One to lift it off, the other to place under my hand while I worked, and then polish after the lift-off. AWESOME tool! You will love these. They are extremely worth it. You do a professional job with these, not some half-baked attempt. And for no more than you spend, and as long as these will last, why not! You won't be taking it for a $150 detailing with these to help make it easier.	2
I'm a newbie RV person (though I'm 74 years old) so took advice of others on blogs and ordered a 25' and a 50' hose for my new travel trailer.  The threads on the female end are plastic so I'm hopeful they will hold up.  They do have a 10 year warranty.  I unrolled them today and had no kinking when I carefully stretched them out.  Since they were wrapped tightly for shipping I assuming under normal use they will serve their purpose well.	2
"I just used this on my car and it does live up to the reviews listed below.  I think the labeling ""natural shine"" does in fact fit this product well.  It gave my car interior a nice ""showroom"" shine but not overly so.  It left the interior glossy and new looking but I would not describe it as greasy or shiny in a distracting way.  Very good product.  I recommend spraying directly onto a towel first so not to get it everywhere in your vehicle."	2
I have an '08 Polaris Sportsman 800, which by itself is not a slow machine. Once I added this filter as a replacement for the original, however, it was a whole different ballgame. I immediately notice the boost to acceleration and pickup from the motor, and as someone who rides mostly off-road in the desert I'm sure I'm adding longevity to the bike as well. Simple install; fits directly in place of the stock filter. A very inexpensive way to grab a few more horses.	2
I used this on a 92 Mercedes 500SL which I had found sitting on a lot. Once this car was mine, I noticed it has some weathered and rough looking areas on the hood, where rain had left deposits. I simply rubbed this on that area, left it over night, and took off that coat. The repeated the process about 3 times. Within 4-5 days, the hood looked like the rest of the car. That is exactly what I bought it for, and it worked perfect.	2
These jack stands are pretty well made.  And very light.  They do the job and offer adequate height adjustment.  Only criticism is that the base is fairly small for its size and could get a little wobbly if the jack is extended to its maximum height.  I haven't had a problem yet, so this concern may be unwarranted.  I use these stands with hockey pucks for protection of my car's frame.  They fit nicely on top of the supports.  I would buy these again for sure.	2
We only have stabilizing jacks on the back of the trailer so we do use the tongue jack as a stabilizer too.  My husband always carried a bucket of pieces of 2 x 4s to support the post.  We decided to try this reasonably priced jack stand instead.It is VERY heavy-duty and does a perfect job.  They sent us a red one, not the black as shown in the photo, but that doesn't effect my rating at all.  For the money, this is an excellent accessory.	2
This thing works with in my 1999 Camry, Replacing it is easy, save 60% by comparing to the OEM one. Get back more MPG after fixing the code. But I still get the code from time to time, Resetting it and it's gone. NO sure if it's the DIY cabling or the car. But I would recommend you to get the one that has the cable already connected. If you get a Sensor failure code, make sure you fix it asap. otherwise you are wasting gas.	2
I have used Flitz extensively over a 15 year timeframe.  I used to detail corporate aircraft, and we had large panels of polished aluminum on spinners, nacelles, and leading edges of the wings.  Flitz made the job go quick, and it provided one of the longest lasting results.  Today, I still use it on cars for brightwork, and on jewelry, silverware, and a multitude of other uses.  2 pounds lasts me a long time despite frequent use.  Flitz also does a good job restoring plastic headlight lenses.	2
I have a 2012 BWM f650gs 800cc twin motorcycle.  These Rotax engines make a very annoying fuel injector tick - TICK,TICK,TICK ... sounds like something is horribly wrong.  But, it is normal.  So, I have found that adding a tablespoon of ashless, smokeless 2-stroke oil each tankful, along with about a cup of Techron - that annoying tick is almost gone.  I run this bike hard and it runs great with this formula.  I also use ASL CamGuard in the oil (5% mixture - also on Amazon).	2
These are good enough for visual rough-leveling of your camper, but they're no precion instrument.  It's tough to install these while holding them level and then sticking them down with the double-sided foam tape on the back side.  Once it's down it's down.  If you stick it on crooked, rip it off and throw it away and start over, or try to twist them level and then put in some screws to hold it there.  The foam tape will allow you to twist them back and forth.	2
Meguiar's Quik is cheap, which is great as long as your interior is already pretty clean. It has no intrinsic cleaning power of it's own beyond that of water. In other words, it will clean exactly as well as a damp cloth. Any dirt that can't be lifted with a damp cloth will stay put. It does have a nice scent, which dissipates in a matter of hours. You'll probably want a more effective product if your car gets a lot of use and/or carries many passengers.	2
This is awesome.  Every time i go to empty the poop tank I get to see everything!  Corn, peanuts, lettuce, seriously...everything!Ok, now that the poop humor is done, It really does help.  When you have a clog, you can see that it's clogged and not just assume that you have an empty tank.  It also helps if you're like me and you want your tank clean, like clear water coming out of the black tank clean.  You can ensure that you get the clean flush every time.	2
This is everything you need in a tread depth gauge, and nothing you don't. Here's how you use it: You press the &#34;probe&#34; down into the tread gap to measure the depth. You then rotate the cylinder around to match the exact mark to the line. The measurements are on four sides of the cylinder, making them easier to read than being stacked on top of one another. Being able to rotate the cylinder makes it much easier to measure something as minute as 1/32 of an inch.	2
Used this on two cars, one silver and one black.Both were done on a cool day in the garage after a clay bar routine.The silver car was super easy and looked great when finished. It came off even easier and faster than I expected using micro-fiber cloths.The black car took more work and had swirls at first. I hit it with an orbital buffer and the swirls were gone.Highly recommend two applications of this for full coverage. It goes fast enough that two applications are no big deal.	2
Bought this to use for a camper, It works as a hose, but the ends are plastic.  Initially, I didn't have a problem with this, but at one campground the end was fused to the spigot at my campsite.  I had to use a wrench to get it to release, this damaged the end and I had to buy a new hose.  Also, before this happened it was difficult to get the hose to not leak through the connection.  Defnitely, I recommend getting a hose with metal ends.	2
"This does not fit my wheels. It needs a hose to fit more stem configurations. The 100 is identical, except for the 0-60 it is 0-100, but states it has a 11"" hose but it doesn't. I recommend a type with a hose for versatility. The 100 is nice but the 60 is fine for most applications. If you have a bike that needs over 60 than look for a 100. This is not for all applications. Also be careful not to drop this or you throw it away."	2
"Actron seems to be a company that makeshigh quality diagnostic equipment. This autoscannertool is very affordable and excellent value formoney. Works very well and is pretty ruggedas I had hoped. The only problem is that fixingthe vehicle based on the diagnosed code isNOT always helpful, sorry. Repairing your car based on thesecodes requires a good understanding of auto repair.For example: code PM001 - Cylinder Misfire. What can a NOVICEdo with ALL that ""helpful"" information (LOL). Relatively easy to use.I will give full marks for the quality of thephysical device otherwise."	2
This is a great product!  It brought back the original look and actually a nice satin-gloss look to my tires.I agree with other reviews, don't care for the Ultra Glossy finish some tire dressing produce and this is a restorer... it helps the rubber.  Just be aware that this is a strong and some what dangerous product, they warn that this can cause  cancer, and as a survivor of Melanoma from last year, I take this cautions seriously!  Just follow the directions, be safe, and enjoy the look this produces!	2
3 things.#1 Spring is cheep and installed incorrectly. Snapped on unpacking so i had to twist it to place it the right (better) way and twist the ends toward inside more, because spring is made of cheep metal that bends like aluminum.#2 Size is too big for regular car filters. Toyotas/Hondas/Motorcycles ETC. Maybe a 5Lite For 3500 utility van will have enough filter diameter for this to fit around, or a huge SUV or a pickup truck.#3 Removal only. does not work the other way around to tight the filter.	2
I have been detailing cars and aircraft for forty years.I have tried almost every thing out there as far as waxes and cleaners go.I'm am a old school Simoniz guy. Yea, lots of work...but it works.I would always use a cleaner first, Dupont worked.I figured it might be time to try something new.So I tried the Mothers clay bar. Did not work well.I tried Meguires Clean and wax and that stuff is great.Tried Klasse, real good stuff.Micro fiber.. the more you spend, the better you get.The clay was a joke.	2
My new Accord didn't respond well to Windex, the so-called &#34;supreme&#34; glass cleaner.  I thought something was wrong with my window, being coated with oil or something. Not the case once I determined Windex = pure junk after trying this Mothers' glass cleaner.  Wow!  What it cleaned perfectly without any streaks at all, even with using cheap paper towels.  So if you're frustrated with poor quality glass cleaning because of Windex or some other junk cleaner, don't hesitate to click and buy !  It's rarely in stores by the way.	2
Great auto wash.  Very sudsy and does a great job with a microfiber wash mitt to clean away the dirt and grime from my car.  Looking forward to trying this with a Foammaster II and see just how good it foams up but im expecting it to work very well.  Smells pretty good too!For the price of this 64 oz container, theres no reason to NOT buy it and use some cheaper car wash or a laundry detergent.  Do your car right and buy this stuff you won't be disappointed.	2
I purchased these microfiber cloths because of all the good reviews, and I needed a couple cloths - very handy to have around. The quality of the cloths are ok, and does a decent job at cleaning.  I am not sure how long these cloths will last after multiple washes as the quality is average.  So far they work just fine, but just think they are some less expensive options for the quality.  I wish someone made some high-end cloths that could work inside my car and on my iPhone.	2
"I mounted these on the bumper of my Ford F250. They are about 24"" off the ground; not too close to the pavement by any means. The housings started to leak within a week or two of being installed. I removed the lights and tried sealing with black silicone, but they still leaked. Perhaps because of the leak, the chrome started flaking off within a few weeks.  I now have very good looking lights, which leak, produce nearly no helpful light, and won't stay aimed in the direction I angled them."	2
This stuff is impossible to find at local auto parts stores. Both walmart and auto parts stores carry a different brand, which leaves the red coating and is in a much smaller bottle. However, i've come to realize over the years that Permatex products are good-to-go, top-notch products. From brake cleaner to this stuff, you can't go wrong with Permatex. This product goes on purple, and one can immediately tell the difference in material quality over the other brands. Does a phenominal job at preventing corrossion on battery terminals. Good stuff.	2
This product works at least as well as other similary priced scratch removers/hiders....only really effective on very shallow and narrow scratches and swirl marks. I have tried 3 of these specialized scratch products, and none of them hide scratches quite as well as regular Eagle One NanoWax (now discontinued). These products work by filling in the scratch with material that makes the scratch visible only under certain lighting conditions and viewing angles. Meguiars, like most of the others, work better than ordinary wax at hiding very minor scratches, but don't expect miracles.	2
"This pad and the yellow polishing pad are perfect. Cell foam material is durable, wash and reuse. This pad worked perfectly on my Home Depot's Ridgid Random Orbital Sander with the hook and loop pad. Don't spend $140+ on a so called ""car"" random orbital polisher. The Ridgid is basically the same thing...yet only costs $60 and I can use it for home improvement work after my car is done. Meguiar's Scratch X 2.0 also works good with this pad to remove minor scratches and blemishes. Use Ultimate Compound for heavier oxidization."	2
This Camco water filter works well on our pop-up camper and did make a noticeable difference in the taste of the water at the campground we stayed at. We forgot to replace our old filter and had to use the water straight out of the hookup on the first night, but picked up this filter at a local big box the next day. There was a marked improvement in the taste of the water when using this filter.We will replace this filter at the end of the season with a new one.Recommended!CFH	2
I detail cars all the time and have used many products with limited or even disappointing results, but Invisible Glass beats them all.  It's almost like using distilled water (which works very well for mild cleaning), and for more moderate dirt removal it may take more than one application, but it cleans exceptionally well.  I use it for auto and home.  It's one of the only products that can be used on tinted or treated glass, it doesn't streak, and if used regularly it almost polishes the glass.  It's a great product!	2
It was quiet and smooth for about 2 months in rainy Seattle. It's not particularly great. It's squeaking now. The plastic &#34;booty&#34; that covers the arms I guess supposed to work to prevent snow from clogging the wiper but did it help? Meh....hard to say. The ends of the wipers have some RED plastic caps on them and it's very distracting to see something RED swooshing in front of my face in the rain. Why couldn't they use black caps?I'm going to look for a triple bladed wiper blade which worked better.	2
I just bought this product after washing my new car for the first time.  I didn't take the time to dry it because I normally don't have issues with water spots but at my apartment my water is awful I guess.  Needless to say my car was destroyed with them.  Huge white nasty spots everywhere.  So I did some research and found this got good reviews so I gave it a shot and WOW.  It totally works on bad waterspots and brought them right out of the finish.  I was very impressed.	2
This is one of my favorite Meguiar's products. I use it on the dashboards and external plastic and vinyl trim. Just give the bottle a good shake, spray on a little and wipe the surface to a brilliant, clean shine. Even after washing the car, when I use the Meruiar's Natural Shine the cleaning power of the product is evident by looking at the blackened cloth used to apply it.Here's a product that works so well, that it's a pleasure to use. I highly recommend Meguiar's Natural Shine Vinyl & Rubber Protectant.	2
I bought this to try on my travel trailer with a gel coat finish. It worked very well, went on easy, wiped off clean, pleasant odor, removed stains and marks. I enjoyed using it compared to a lot of other products I have tried over the years. I have found that Meguiar products generally are quite good. Price is not great but reasonable - I was satisfied and will purchase this product again. Oh yeah, I should have mentioned that I applied by hand with terry cloth towel and removed with microfiber cloth.	2
I bought 2 of these, one to keep in my truck for road side emergencies and the other for automotive work use at home. The few times I have used them they work well, but just so you know they have a recommended expiration date on them. I think this is due to their intended use as a RV chock, where they would sit in the sun a lot and would degrade. But again they are cheap, and if the worries you, just buy a new one and toss out the suspect one!	2
This is the Cadillac of battery chargers.  I put my Miata on the charger each winter.  Doesn't overcharge the battery, doesn't dry out the cells, just works perfectly.  It will even charge up a dead battery if you give it a few days.  At this low amperage it isn't ideal for this, but it will work.This is about $50.  A new battery is about $100.  Leaving a battery discharging or not charging for a long time (months) kills the battery.  Do the math and you see you can't afford not to have one.	2
I used 2 containers in my 38 gallon 2005 Ford pick up tank and 1 unit in my 2002 Hyundai. Within about 1/2 of the tank being used in both vehicles, the Hyundai engine light turned off (mechanic recommended doing this first) and on the second treatment for my pick up the mileage increased by .75 miles per gallon and I noticed a bit more power and smoother sound to the engine. My mechanic suggested I do this every 3 months due to the Biofuels mixture used in gas these days. Nice improvement!	2
This is a very useful RV product.  Some RV parks and locales require this type of product to preclude sewerage spills.  It provides secondary protection in case the regular gray or black valve has a leak.  This way, when you take the cap off, a possible leak is held back by this valve (if it is properly closed).  The unit locks on just like a regular sewer drain hose fitting.  Unlike some other brands this unit turns on its axis so that you can align the valve handle exactly where you need it.	2
Recently I had a steel garage door installed. Opening and closing the door was a noisy event. I called the installer and was told that the hinges needed to go through a break-in stage and to reduce the noise a 20 weight oil was recommended. I applied a dab of Royal Purple Synthetic Engine Motor Oil 20W50 on each hinge and the results far exceeded my expectations. The door opening and closing was the quietest it has ever been including when the old door was still in use. This is an excellent lubricant.	2
Great all around product with strong uv protection especially important here in Florida. Used another product that really screwed up my dash  board. This fixed it right up and does not leave a shinny surface that is going to reflect in your windshield. I would describe the finish it leaves as satin. I would suggest spraying it on a cloth when doing your dash board so as not to get it on the inside of the windshield. If you just want to use one product for all your rubber and vinyl this is it.	2
I purchased this product based on positive reviews by amazon.com customers to restore the rear trim on my 1998 Buick Riviera. While it makes a nice shine, Back to Black did NOT make the trim black again; it remains grey. I expected a more drastic improvement, like some of the tire shine products.In fact, I tried Black Magic &#34;Tire Wet&#34; on the rear trim, and it provides at least as good a shine as Back to Black.Bottom line : product is okay, but will not by any means restore black trim back to black	2
I used this tool to winterize our travel trailer.  Simply screw it on to your water hook-up, and then attach your standard air adaptor to your compressor hose - and presto - you're in business.The tip is flexible, but secure.  That is, after connecting your air hose to this plug, you can tip the hose in any of 360-degress, and it will flex.  This is great, because in colder weather a more rigid adaptor might break.I would recommend this plug for anyone that wants to winterize their RV, and I would purchase it again.	2
I never thought of using paste wax, I used the liquid version of this wax, I was very pleased with the results, but the paste was way easier to use. The container comes with an application sponge which can be stored in the tin. It was less messy than liquid, I can never go back to a liquid now. I'm not sure about the durability of the wax, but since I use a spray wax regularly and a good detailer.....dirt has no chance of stickin to my car's paint.I will buy this wax again.	2
"I would recommend these towels.We use them, and microfiber is one towelthat won't put scratches and swirl marks in a paints finish.All microfiber works well but low price towels may notresult in the best quality product.If you buy cheap you get cheap, and my car deserves the best.Show Car Guys 3 - Pack Of Ultra Blue Plush Microfiber Towels 16"" x 16 ""- At 360 GSM, This Is One Of Our Best Microfiber Cleaning Cloths-It Has Ultra Plush Micro Fiber Material On One Side, And The Other Side Consists Of Medium Terry Microfiber Material."	2
I get that this is the size that it is so it can be set inside of a sink, but who does that anyway??!!  It's designed to be set on the counter and allow the water to drain into the sink - they would have made this much more functional had they made it twice the length so it could accommodate more dishes.  A nice effort by Camco, but overall disappointed at the missed opportunity.It does have a notch in the drain tray that goes over raised beveled sink edges, so that's pretty useful.	2
I have been using two of these battery tenders for my Yamaha snowmobiles for 2 years  now. I leave them plugged in all the time. The batteries are always fully charged, and have never had a worry about not having full battery when I need it, regardless of how cold it got. I would purchase again no question about it.10/11/12 Update, just purchased 2 more I love them so much. Have left the previous 2 on the snowmobiles, and now have one on lawn tractor, and the other new one on the CAN-AM Spyder.	2
I had K&N; filters before on BMW cars in the early 2000s, despite all sorts of warnings about it can damage mass air flow (MAF) meter. Love them because they do give that extra-something to the engine during acceleration.K&N; now assures public that its tests were accepted by major car manufacturers, and that it will not void any warranty by the dealer service centers. That obviously speaks volumes. I got this for a recent model Sienna V6 and it fits fine. Look forward to save money over the lifetime while increase engine performance a bit.	2
"simple, logic and easy to use.  a useful tool to read data from the computer on your car, read codes and diagnose by yourself with a little search on the web. you can take note on the different indicators to know the ""normal parameters"" of your car, and notice when any change occurs and an error code lights your CEL, that way it will be easier to tell what went wrong.The only con is that there isnt any cable or software to connect to a PC or laptop- that would make it a better tool."	2
How do you rate an oil filter? I'll just say I've been using Mobil 1 for 20+ years and I've never had any lubrication related engine damage casualties. I drive hard long miles too. The filter, seems to be built particularly to stand up to M1's longevity and thickness. I never knew they made filters until I joined Amazon. Always used stock. Now I don't understand why Amazon's pricing on the oil is so bad. 5qt bottles here are $50+ as compared to $25 at Walmart(one of the best deals known to man). Enough said...	2
I love this funnel, it has so many uses. For example I can pour a liquid into a container with a small opening with great ease. I can hang it on a wall and it will wait there until I need to pour another liquid into a container with a small opening again. Let's see a hammer do either of those things. My hammer never stays put. You can reason with this funnel, it has an open mind so to speak. Others may try but they all fall short of the splendor that is this funnel.	2
It works well, I am surprised that someone else does not make it[cheaper].  It is a very low tech material.  We used it in the doors of a friends car when speakers were replaced and spent over $100.  I bought three cans of rubberized undercoat at Wally-World for about $5 per can and my doors were just as quiet.  I guess it is just personal preference and economic priority, for me the extra $85 in the pocket was better.  My friend, well he spends money like a drunken sailor...not to offend any drunken sailors out there.	2
I have my daylighters mounted near the side pillars of my pickup and these guards clean up the look nicely. It also cuts down on the glare that shines onto the hood from my mounting location. I cant tell a huge difference on light output, so that is a plus. They lock on so secure that I have actually cut my hand on them trying to get them off. Wont lose them on the trail and its a nice deterrent to anyone looking to walk by and just pull it off to walk off with it.	2
A liter of this stuff will last you a long time if you don't have many cars with leather seats. I just bought this for my lambskin leather jacket and my leather gloves. It seems to really soften up the leather. I think my jacket was really &#34;dry&#34; and it felt considerably heavier afterwards. The leather feels much more durable. My gloves are also much more water repellant and don't absorb water quite so quickly. I have no way of knowing if this is the best product on the market, but nonetheless it's pretty darned good!	2
Finally used up my first bottle of this after a few years.  The great thing about this wax is that it is easy to remove the dried haze.  You can leave it overnight if want and it still buffs off easily.  Also it does not turn most plastic white if you get some on the plastic but I still avoid it.You don't need to apply much, just enough to cover the surface.  Does not have much polishing action so the paint needs to be clean before starting.  Also I use it on chrome, chromed plastic, etc.	2
It's been a month and it's pretty much has cleared the musty smell from the ax however the car has never had it done in 10 years until so I think I'll get another one and do it again in a couple of months and see if any left over is there but it does do the job.  Oh and be carefull because other people complain that the hose curls up and goes back out and sprays them in the face.  It didn't happen to me but just in case. You are not so sharp  Ha!!	2
"I'm a professional detailer.This sealant is one of the best out there, if you're paint is prepped properly. I use my 3"" Griot's garage buffer to apply this stuff on the lowest buffer speed with a 3M Perfect-It waffle pad. Meguiar's has been in the detailing business for a long time and I use all of their Mirror Glaze/Professional products. Some other brands are more expensive for less amount of product and produce the same results. This price is great for the amount you get, buy this and you'll be happy. See the images I uploaded."	2
I bought the Rain-X Weatherbeater Wiper Blades for one of my Hyundai Elantras. They weren't the cheapest replacements out there, but they still cost under $10 so I gave them a shot. I had them installed in under 5 minutes. They fit and work perfectly. They clear my windows without streaks, and they are silent too. I give them 4 stars because I have Anco blades installed on my other Elantra, and they cost about 30% less. They also work equally as well. With that said though, I can still recommend the Rain-X Weatherbeater Wiper Blades.	2
I use Permatex regularly, especially on lug bolts. It is economical and this size container is especially handy to have. Remember to stir the contents well and use only a very small amount. I tend to use a disposable acid brush for application, rather than the lid mounted brush. In fact, I tend to remove the included brush and prefer to just have the lid as a lid.  It has never failed me. I would use a copper based product for exhaust work, but this works well for all other fasteners. It also cleans up easy.	2
Bought this after my wife ran over a screw.  Didn't have one at the time so I had to use my father's set.  Well surprise, she ran over another screw somehow last week and I pulled this bad boy out and plugged that hole right up without having to even put on the spare.People say you're supposed to have the holes professionally patched at a dealer, but if the hole isn't any kind of tear and is just a puncture, I have never had any issues with plugs falling out after 1000's of miles of driving.	2
Knock on wood - been working in my Lexus RX300 for about 2 months.  Look around, but I couldn't find a better price than these guys.  It's also a true Denso, not a knock-off.  Autozone had the same unit for about 2x the price.  Dealer was even more.  Shipping is a bit slow, but nothing to get all ruffled about.  Maybe 5-6 days or so.  Replaced the sensor, reset the lights with a scanner and viola - all lights out and stayed out.  I think lights will go out by themselves anyway after 3 cold starts	2
I really appreciate the Rain X in a light drizzle or mist, when the water seems to disperse by itself with minimal windshield wiper use. When you apply before the cold weather, though, it helps prevent ice from sticking to your windshield, which is just great. I also like to use the product on the back window, which doesn't have a wiper, because it keeps the window clearer. Follow the directions--let it dry to a light haze and wipe it off with a microfiber or paper towel until the windshield is clear. I'm sure you'll like it.	2
Awesome.  Just used this for the first time earlier today.  I've owned a natural chamois but haven't used it in years so I threw it away.  This works great.  Washed my car and then used a Water Blade on it (def another recommended product) and then used this on all the corners and tight spaces.  Soaks the water up very well, rings out a lot of the water and stores &#34;damp&#34; which means little to not maintenance to maintain.  Covers a lot of area too I was surprised once I unfolded it just how big it was.	2
Very clever idea. Had to use on my 2013 Jeep Wrangler Unlimited Sahara with a lift kit and adjustable drop hitch. Spinning ball hitches for different sizes won't work in my case because the adjustable hitch height is a solid piece specific to the entire hitch. In order to tow my 2 different trailers I'd need 2 drop hitches. Interchangeable balls is the perfect solution and I have to say these are perfect. They work well and are rated around 8k pounds of towing. Saved a lot of money here compared to my closest towing accessory store.	2
"The item was just as discribed. Genuine Leather, it does fit sung. My wheel is a PT Crusier GT. It is leather, but it's starting to show wear. So I bought this to try? It was a bit hard to put on. So I laid it in the Sun for awhile. It went on. But don't add anything to help it along. You don't want it to slip. My Steering Wheel is 15"", but it fits like it was made for it! My secret for keeping them looking HOT, is KIWI Black shoe polish, hand rubbed. SW"	2
ArmorAll is great if you're in your teens and want your interior to look like you cleaned it with a can of crisco.  Even their matte products still leave you with a glossy sheen.  When it comes to me and my cars, I tend to look for quality products that I can use over and over again.  I've always found that with einszett products.  From interior to exterior, their products work flawlessly and produce great results.  The additional minty, slightly clinical yet sweet smell is always welcome in my vehicles.  Don't think twice, you won't be disappointed.	2
"After reading the reviews, I decided to give this a shot.  It's easy to apply and remove and smells a lot better than the Carnauba wax by mother, but it did not provide the same glossy ""wet"" look.  I prefer the Ca Gold Carnauba wax over this one.I have about 4 bottles of Wax and I always seem to go back to the Carnauba wax.  The other 3 are just collecting dust.Read my reviews and see pics of my review below.Mothers 05750 California Gold Pure Brazilian Carnauba Wax Liquid - 16 oz (Ultimate Wax System, Step 3)"	2
This toilet paper is on the thin side as compared to high end soft toilet paper. So far I haven't ripped through it like I have had some toilet paper do. You will still use more of it than you normally would, but it will still last as there is a lot on the roll. It won't replace toilet paper in your home, but for a travel trailer, where your concerned with not clogging your black water tank, this is perfect. I suppose it would work well in a home that has septic tank issues as well.	2
Man I love amazon I never have to stand in a lne at a store ever again (: and prices are as good or better and the Prime membershiop is the best money you could spend I think..  This air head is the best I've used had a diferent one that would bend the dang schrader valve 1 out of 5 times But that was a totaly different item and dealIn all the hundreds of tansactions I've done with amazon just one was a problem that the seller will not honor their warranty on a a auto radiator	2
Nice to have something other than a standard flat or Phillips head screw if you have a nice plate frame or even a backup camera mounted over your plates. If your mounting screws go straight into your car rather than taking the lock nuts behind a bracket, these screws will most likely be too big to fit. I just drilled out the plastic pieces that were mounted to my car and then just threaded these in. Ended up with a nice tight fit. Add the little plastic caps for a nice clean look.Cruiser Accessories 82050 Screw Covers, Black	2
I got this to plug in to my lawn mower a few weeks till spring to make sure the battery had a good charge, since I had to use a motorcycle to jump it earlier in the winter, to see if it worked after I bought it (came with the house). This Battery Tender did the job. I plugged it in for a few weeks, and then when it came time to start up the mower, it had no issues.The small size of the unit is a plus, as it is easy to store when not in use.	2
"Hate those clip latches for the rv/travel trailer door? Worse yet, have a broken one? This is THE quick, easy and simple solution.Installed this right over former clips (even used the same screw holes). Rather than installing sideways (horizontally) as shown, do so vertically. It allows the hanging t portion to drop down when not in use rather than clank agains the side of the camper. It latches just as easily but also reduces the little amount of ""give"".This is much more stable than the clip. Less prone to break and a great price. Super easy to install."	2
Bought two of these for our travel trailer that has two steps.Husband says it was an easy quick install.It looks good on the steps (new trailer definitely want it to look good)Stays in place and weathers well.This trailer has no carpeting so dirt shows up quickly.  this definitely helps reduce the amount of dirt being tracked into the trailer.  While these are important I also have an awing rug on the ground outside the trailer and a small rug inside the door.  (have grandchild that travels with us so everything that can help reduce the dirt is huge)	2
My wife parked under a tree that left tiny sap particles all over the car (a 2011 VW Sportwagen). I've tried using mineral spirits which did nothing so I tried this. While it didn't make the car perfect, it made a very noticeable improvement. Had I not dropped one of the bars on the ground and immediately discarded it, I think I could have made an even better improvement. I was careful not to press too hard, but I did use some pressure. As others noted, this did cause some very faints scratches which were easily removed with wax.	2
These work well - installed them just before a 2000 mile trip in mostly rain and they worked very well both in heavy rain and light  mist. No streaks, no chatter, and no problem with wind. My previous wiper blade would tend to lift off the windshield a bit at high speeds. I'm not sure if it's from the beam design of these blades or what, but they worked well at all speeds.They were very easy to install, I nearly needed a hammer to get my last set of blades on and off, but these snapped right on easily.	2
"Fits my 1994 Dodge Ram pickup that has the 318 motor.  Grew weary of the cheaper (orange) filters made of such thin metal you can fold the case with your bare hand, let alone an oil filter wrench.  As I don't put many miles on the truck these days, I change oil and filter annually, not on mileage.  Though these filters are more expensive, it is cheap insurance, and oil changes are much easier now.  All you need is a ratchet and 1"" socket.  Glad Amazon stocks these at a reasonable price.  I use K&N oil filters exclusively now."	2
Packaging was nice as always and shipment quick. Of course this was a drop in so it fit nice and snug for my 2004 Tahoe Z71. Was giving the newly used Z a tuneup so I replaced the plugs, wires, cleaned MAF, TB, cleaned out the filter housing as it had grime inside of it, then just dropped this in. Z breathes better although I would really like to acquire a tube to replace the quiet factory one! Anyways, I recommend the filter as it looks better than factory, and will be used and cleaned for MANY miles to come!	2
The Tender Jr. does not come with a cigarette adapter so I cut this in half to make two. I purchased 2 lighter plugs for a buck each from China&#8230; with free shipping&#8230; and they are working fine. These aren&#8217;t an exact match with the Tender cables but they fit together OK and are easy to determine polarity with the wire colors. You can also just use this as an extension cord for your Tender. The description states a length of 12-inches&#8230; but it&#8217;s actually 14-inches tip-to-tip on the connectors. Nice item for the price and it&#8217;s made in Mexico.	2
This tool was just what I needed for a difficult to access connector. Lots of under hood connectors get very brittle and fragile with age but this worked great in my application and I was able to lift the retaining snap just enough to remove it without breakage. Will it work every time...probably not but it always helps to have the right tool for the job to minimize frustration. The tool I received had a grey handle not red like the picture. Not a big deal for me but thought it was worth mentioning for people who care about that...	2
I purchased a bottle of Mothers Glass cleaner simply because I have used other Mothers products (waxes) and they seem to work very well. Also, this cleaner is safe for tinted windows because it does not contain ammonia.Unfortunately, I was extremely disappointed with this glass cleaner as it streaked more than Windex and no matter what I tried, I could not remove the streaks at all!I did not notice any difference in the streakiness between non-tinted and tinted glass. Both were pretty bad.I ended up just throwing the bottle out and went back to using microfiber cloths and purified/distilled water.	2
This and a specific German made variant of Castrol are the only oils I use in my VW, due to strict requirements listed by the manufacturer.Unfortunately, due to where I live, I often have a hard time finding oils that meet the VW 502 requirements locally.  The auto stores nearby price out six quarts of Mobil 1 for a few pennies cheaper, but it is always hit or miss as to whether they actually have any available or on order.Amazon delivers this rather fast.  Great for those months when it could be weeks before I could see the product locally.	2
We love this potty chair (bought one for each bathroom).  The design is simple.  It is comfortable and easy to use.  My 2 year old son has had no problems with it.  Very portable (we keep it in the back of our vehicle for longer trips).  We also have the BabyBjorn potty seat which is great as well.  I like having both so my son can choose whichever he wants (he likes both equally).  Made in the USA too!!	3
We had the Summer Infant clippers first.  They came in a two-pack, with a smaller clipper and a larger clipper.  Neither one worked well.  The larger of the two didn't work at all.  These Safety First clippers cut every time.  For those of you who know how difficult it can be to clip a baby's nails, you also know how frustrating it can be to finally get the clipper positioned right and then have it not cut.  AAAAARRRRGGGHHHH!These work every time.	3
We got *seven* extensions for this and put a fence across our den, marking off a one-hundred-square-foot area for the lil'guy to crawl around in. I was worried that the length would make it insecure, but it doesn't: Just be sure not to have the fence completely straight; use the nifty connection corners to alternate turns, using either angles back and forth or a serpentine pattern. Then hang stuff like toys, instruments, and mobiles from it. Our lil'guy loves it! :)	3
I use the pump-in-style advanced breastpump, and I really like that these bottles screw right into the pump assembly.  I like having many bottles on hand so that I don't need to wash them every day.  I don't freeze my milk in these (I use Gerber bags), but they're great for temporary storage until pouring into the feeding bottles.  I use Avent bottles as my baby seems to like the shape and flow of the newborn nipples (these nipples seem too fast-flowing).	3
I love these breastmilk storage containers.  They make it so easy to collect the milk, cap it, and store it.  When I need the milk, I just take them out of the freezer, heat it in the bottle heater, put on a nipple and go.  They are great.  Perfect size for my baby who still only drinks about 3-4 ounces per sitting.  I will definitely continue to use these after she outgrows them for milk as baby food containers.  They are great.	3
I have used disposable drop-in liners from multiple stores (Wally-World, the bullseye store, & various drugstores) and find that they all work just as fine as these Playtex ones do, but at half the price.  I like that the Playtex liners are thinner feeling, meaning the liner collapses better inside the bottle when baby is drinking...but even with the others feeling like a thicker plastic, they work as well.  Playtex, come down in price and you'll get 5 stars instead of only 4.	3
"My son loves to play ""dino world"" just about every day!! The tub is great for storing the set & theres plenty of room for more things.  We keep a bunch of blocks and small cars in there to add tothe scene and creative play.  The mat it comes with is kind of a joke , lasting maybe one day.  But that's no reason to not buy this.Like others, we purchased thise elsewhere for MUCH less than the 60-something Amazon is currently selling it."	3
Got this for my daughter (shes 2).  I like it real well.  She is a smaller child and it fits pretty good.  She can sit on it and on feel like she's going to fall in.  I would recommend this to others.  I also got the step stool. She likes to run over to the sink and wash her hands when she's done....The step is nice too.BabyBjorn Safe Step - White(I got the pink one to match her seat)It stays put and is sturdy.	3
I really like Avent's versatility; the nipples, spouts, cups, bottles and handles can all be used interchangeably.I don't like the way they classify their nipples.  Each nipple has 3 classifications.  I wish they would only use one classification system because it can be quite confusing if you go to buy different nipples.1.) flow2.) baby's age3.) a numberAlso, the title of the item doesn't say what age or number of nipple this is, and there currently isn't a description.FYI:They are number 3 for 3+ months.	3
"There is one by this same company made specifically for dresser type changing tables. I have it and love it. It is almost a necessity. Holds wipe warmer, diapers, diaper creme, hair brush/comb, some q-tips, powder, small bottle of lotion...you get it. It holds the essentials, not everything you bought for baby. Both are great, but it depends on the type of changing table you have. Or if you choose to use the top of a dresser like I did, you'll love the ""Dresser Depot""."	3
I loved this tracker so much, I bought several more and used for the entire first year. It's a great way to see a new infants progression toward feeding and sleeping schedules. In the sleep deprived first weeks it was so helpful in keeping track of diaper count, feeding sides,  etc. Once we introduced solid foods, I could track when I offered new foods to watch for signs of intolerance.  I just purchased again for new baby's arrival. I highly recommend for new or seasoned moms.	3
Its great, it fits so many items, i fit like 15-18 size 1 diapers, wipes, bottle of cream, tube of diaper cream, lots of small staff (hair brush, cotton swabs, nail clippers, alcohol pads, etc.) it very easy to put it together, i never had a problems with it falling down or falling apart. Plastic is very thick and seems sturdy. Well  this huge plastic thing doesnt look very attractive, but it super useful and clear, so u dont see it right away in the room.	3
What I liked:  Contained the smell.  Ease of use.  Takes regular garbage bags (saves money!).  Great capacity (empty it out once in 7 days or so). Sturdy. Easy to clean - I wipe it down with Clorox wipes.What I didn't like: Not especially good-looking and at times the lid gets stuck in a certain position (could just be a problem with mine) hence the four stars.Would buy again though and do recommend it. (I have used the Diaper Genie at a friend's place - didn't like it).	3
As I am wtitng this review my 5 year old son just re-discovered this set, since I had it at the top of the closet. He can play hours with this great quality dinosaurs he got for his b-day. He had a few more, big and small ones that he just added to this set, so it is pretty amazing what he does when he's playing with all of them. The quality of the mat is awful, but you really don't need the mat for this set.	3
I LOVE these because they are really convenient and easy to use. We have it by our pool (baby gated) under the overhang so we can enjoy the pool and sun and yet have LO out there playing or asleep at the same time. It is very convenient. I do not like the cleaning issues. It is hard to clean and though it is billed &#34;PACK N PLAY&#34; like it is the &#34;umbrella stroller&#34; of play yards, it is hardly that easy to just fold and run.	3
This is great! It's so much nicer than the hard plastic tubs. My 6 month old doesn't slide around in this and it's easy for me to rest my arm on the tub while washing her. (Couldn't do that with the plastic tub.) Easy to fill up and easy to clean up. It even has a suction cup so it doesn't slide around in the tub. (I also use that for hanging up so it dries out after every bath.) This tub just makes bathtime much easier!	3
Nice and sturdy! Easy to install and use. It has hands-free opening so its good when you have your hands full like I always do. This gate wont budge when it is installed so it is very safe. It looks nicer then some of the other gates on the market.We still have this years later and got a second one when we moved. My oldest is almost 4 and she still cant open it on her own. She isn't heavy enough for the peddle. Still loving it!	3
I had a homemade quiet book when I was a kid and saw some on pinterest.  Since I don't know how to sew, I visited Etsy to see if I could buy one from that site.  I couldn't believe the prices!  I found this and ordered it for my three kids (9 mos, 2 years, and 3 years), and they all love it.  It's pricey, but it's good quality and much easier on the pocketbook than others.  Great book, and I love that all the pieces are attached!	3
We love that this seat makes it comfortable for our little boy compared with the wider conversion style potty chairs (the ones that turn into step stools) because the back is higher and it has arm rests.  Another great perk is that it takes up significantly less space.  Makes it easier to keep it conveniently located for your toddler.  Also, despite its 'lack' of bell and whistles it is easy to clean and safe.  The no skid rubber bottom is an excellent feature!  Highly recommend this potty chair!	3
My son loves this.  He likes the &quot;kangaroo&quot; position best. He was actually crying the first time we put him in it this way, and stopped immediately.  DEFINITELY make sure the one you buy comes with the video, though.  At our Babies R Us many were just in plastic bags (returns?) without the book and video.  They are a must.  The usual type carriers which have baby putting all their weight on their pelvic bone aren't good for their developing bones.  Slings keep the baby in more natural positions.	3
ALL DIAPERS SMELL, no matter what you put them in, especially once your kid starts solid foods. Get over it. This pail is fantastic.  We use it for our dogs' poop bags, and line it with Ruffies scented trash bags (we use vanilla, they also have lavender, and they are cheap). There is no smell, except in the summer when it is hot (and that's only because the pail is outside on the back porch, the one we buy for the nursery will be inside in the air conditioning).	3
I know that every doctor says an oral temperature doesn't count, you have to take a rectal one.  But seriously, I hate taking my sons rectal temperature.  It is gross, he is squirming around.  Yuck.  This is so much easier. You pop it in their mouth, couple of seconds later, you have your temperature.  I have found it to be really accurate, unlike the ear one, which reads completely different on each ear.  Plus it is so small I bought a second one for our diaper bag.  Super convenient!	3
We got this as a baby shower gift and my son has loved it since he was about 3 months old.  At first, he was fascinated with looking at the lights and hearing the music.  But as he got older, he learned how to play with it more.  He is now almost 18 months and he knows which songs he likes over other ones.  He will hit the blue button multiple times till he gets to the song he wants to hear.  I love that he loves this toy!	3
Look through the reviews and you can see many people upset about these leaking. They are correct! Because it only happens to one in about four or five reviewers, I think there must be a problem with production. Maybe some are leaky, some are not. Fact is, out of ten bottles, five of mine were leaky. I ended up throwing the whole lot out after using more money on paper towels than bottles.Save yourself the headache and get evenflo or playtex. They are half the cost and never leak	3
These bottles are a good choice if you're breastfeeding, but have to introduce a bottle. My son has never had a problem going from the breast to this bottle and back to the breast again.Also, after months of frequent use, I have never experienced the leaking problem with these bottles mentioned by some other reviewers. I also know of other moms who have used these for more than a year and no leaks either. I have even taken the tops apart and put them back together and still no leaks.	3
These are easy to put on and take off.  They work well to connect two umbrella strollers.  The rubber inserts do fall out easily, so I can tell these may not last long.  They only work with one thickness of bar so they are not compatible with all strollers.  I use a combination of these for the top connection and a different brand for the bottom that are adjustable since my stroller bars are wider at the base and I connect in 4 places instead of 3 for a sturdier connection.	3
This warmer costs more than it's worth.  We have to stand there while it's &quot;warming&quot; a bottle until the light turns off and then when we check the bottle it's still cold.  Having to stand hawk eyed over a bottle warmer with a crying, hungry baby isn't fun...especially when it doesn't warm the first time around.  On the other hand, if the bottle stays in a minute too long, the milk gets so hot that we have to set it in cold water.  There has to be something better out there!	3
We started off sterilizing using the old-fashioned, boiling water in a pot...what a mess and waste of time! Standing over the boiling pot and risking steam burns ran out of fun very quickly. After I got over the sticker shock for the sterilizer and got it home, I couldn't see how we survived before! It's quick, easy and efficient. New moms have enough to mess with, don't spend you few, precious moments each day waiting for a pot of water to boil, splurge on this item and you won't regret it!!	3
This holds our wipe warmer and about 2 days' worth of diapers, so far so good.  However, the side containers really don't hold much.  We can fit diaper cream on one side, and our little man's brush and baby lotion on the other.  I keep hand sanitizer and lotion for me on the changing table between the pad and the edge of the table.  Wish it would hold a little more, but it's great to have the things it will hold within easy reach of our son while we're changing him.	3
I recommend the large quilted multi-use pad in addition.  I have about 4 of them and they are essential.  I use John Lennon receiving blankets (6 is a good number) with an quilted absorbing pad underneath to be prepared for spills and smudges on my contoured changing pad. I do the same on his crib to save me the headache of changing crib sheets which are very tedious to get off and on. It's nearly impossible to do when you've had a c-section, and not a good idea to strain yourself.	3
"I was so excited when I recieved this tub thinking it would last for years. Well, first you can NOT use it in your home bathtub, because the suction cups will not adhere to a non-slip surface. Most tubs are non-slip, that's what the little bumps are for in your tub. This was fine though, I planned to use it on our kitchen counter. No matter how hard I pressed on the middle ""locking"" device water always leaked out onto the counter and floor. This tub is more trouble than it's worth!"	3
I found the nipple to be way too hard for my newborn son to suck.  I then ran out and got the Munchkin Tri-flow.  You can change how fast the milk flows out of the bottle as you baby grows and the nipple is much softer!Munchkin also sells just the nipple that is compatable with the Avent bottle.  So, if you've already purchased the avent bottles your money has not gone to waste!  The only problem is that the Tri-flow is still fairly new and is very hard to find!  Good Luck!	3
This product seems great.  You can use it for every purpose which involves your baby.  We have them in different sizes for the Crib, bassinett, playard, and just extra changing pads for middle of the night changes and carry around pad.  They absorb great and wash with no problems.  I tumble dry low, that way they keep their shape longer.  Take them everywhere and dont have to worry about laying your little one on hard cold surfaces when diaper changing.  Very affordable and worth every penny.  I highly recommend to every parent.	3
Great Idea. Doesnt work on plugs that are bulky and go sideways. But will work for most plugs even some large ones. The reason i gave it a 3 stars is because two reasons.One the wires come out the top making it hard to put them in a cord hider. Two bc they do come out of the top by daughter can still grab and chew on them. Would be better if they had the wires group together out the side. I saw a more expensive version of this that did that.	3
I was told that you can warm up water in the microwave or just put it in a bowl full of hot boiling water. But, in the middle of the night after weeks of bad sleep, the last thing you want to do is exactly that!! With the avent express bottle warmer is the easiest way to warm up your bottles with less trouble. The only thing that I dont like of this product is that doesnt have an on/off switch. Otherwise, its great!!! ( avent products are the best out there...)	3
I bought this because my older daughter had one just like it about 9 years ago. This clip is being used only when we go on car rides, so baby doesn't lose her pacifier. Well after about 4 months of occasional use the clip itself won't close all the way, so it doesn't secure to anything. Pacifier constantly falls onto the floor. Very disappointed as it's a cute design and it fit in her pacifier holder. Now its only purpose is to take up space in a landfill. Junk, do not buy!	3
How FUN and AWESOME!!! Got this for my grandson and still can't get over how bright and playful this is. Even I want to get in it and play! The built in activities on the side are the best. The squeaker is a bit hard to press and sure you will have to do for baby...but the other toys are super! It was so so so simple to put up!!! Love the bigger size, while not being overwhelming...those smaller play yards just are too small to be used when you need them most...	3
The DEX Pillow is great.  I have been using it for about 3 weeks now and I am 21 weeks along.  The pillow is not overly big and fits nicely under the belly.  I tried the fully body boppy pillow, but had trouble sleeping with it and I had trouble with having to adjust it again after turning over.  This pillow is easy to change sides with.  Before pregnancy I slept on my belly.  I find that this pillow has really helped me transition from being a belly sleeper to a side sleeper.	3
Bought a hundred dollar pack and play and this was my ONLY option for a sheet.  Can't they make the cheap one and a higher end sheet for those who don't mind spending money for better quality??Also, keep in mind your wash loads.  I bought this in navy and then realized that everything else I have for baby is pastels.  Sheet has to be washed seperately from rest of baby's laundry.  Would be better to choose a lighter color that could go into the same load as the rest of the baby's laundry.	3
"I have a basic single row power strip, and i couldn't shut the smaller side door or it would depress the power switch... therefore making this completely useless to me.The snap buttons are hard to open and close, so it would be good to keep little fingers out, but i just couldnt use it for my power strip.The stip i have is SIMILAR to this one,&lt;...>but not exactly the same. Mine is dark color and newer looking with spots labeled ""adapter"" so you can plug in large plugs and not lose any outlet space."	3
I am one of those without a dishwasher, unfortunately.  I use this sterilizer a few times a day for my baby's bottles and parts.  I don't use Avent bottles - works fine with other bottles.  I have to agree about making sure it's shut/snapped properly.  You have to make sure it's just right before you snap -- otherwise, you will break a nail or two.  Also exercise caution when taking it out of the microwave.  I always use an oven mitt to take it out and when opening the lid to avoid steam burns.	3
This diaper caddy is a wonderful addition to our baby room which has very little counter space to put stuff. It fits our munchkin diaper warmer but just barely and holds about 20 diapers in the storage below. When you do pull diapers out sometimes 2 or more come out. The side holders aren't locked in so if you try to pick up the entire diaper caddy just by holding the side pocket it will fall.If you're looking for more reviews of baby registry essentials, read the baby registry guide from AllMomsArePerfect.com. Good luck!	3
I bought this based on good reviews in the Baby Bargains book, so I had high expectations. It does make it somewhat easier to change sheets in the middle of the night, but you still have to unsnap it from about 10 places on the crib to do so; I've also found the snaps a little difficult to engage. If you're not using crib bumpers, the look of all the elastic pieces on the crib slats isn't too attractive. I'm glad to have one of these, but it isn't the miracle sheet I hoped for.	3
I thought this would be a great idea. So when we found out we were having twins i ran out and bought 2 of them. We started to put the nurserys together and when it came time to put these on they wouldnt fit. I didnt want to stratch the crib rails up so we took them back. When we did try to play a cd in them it skipped. We ended up just buying small cd/radio players for each of their room because this is something they can both use for a long time.	3
First time potty training for our 14 months daughter.  Too many choices available on the market, but trusted all the other reviews on Amazon. This no frills potty chair doesnt look like much, but I really think they did a wonderful job designing it.  Easy to clean, and my toddler isnt uncomfortable sitting on it to go potty.  The high back rest helps alot, because she tends to sit far back to get comfortable.  Its very stable and we dont worry about it tipping over.Good value, nice design, and definitely easy to clean.  Highly recommended.	3
These cups don't spill, but the liquid comes out too fast for my daughter.  She's 8 months and still on stage 1 nipples because she chokes easily, so that's not the cups fault.  She was drinking water from these yesterday and had it running all down her chin then choked a little.  So if your baby is fine with a faster flow... go for it!  I'm hoping to use these once she's a little older since they really don't leak at all.  She kept holding it upside down and tossing it and nothing came out!	3
These drop-ins are okay - they are not an improvement over an ordinary bottle. Yes, I can simply throw these liners away after using them, but since I still have to wash the bottle's nipple, this system does not save me any time. I use these liners in conjunction with my bottle warmer and they don't melt, which is good. I bought the Playtex Drop-In system to try to reduce the amount (frequency and quantity) that my baby spits up. However, the amount of spit-up is the same - not better, but also not worse.	3
This is the most poorly made baby bath I have ever used. It is impossible to get folded and unfolded. When you do get that figured out then you get to deal with the stupid sling. My baby kept slipping down and her ears would get under water. She is now to big for the sling, but to small to sit up in the ring. I gave it a fair try, but I had to go out and buy another bath. It seems like a great concept, but it is really just a waste of [money].	3
As the mother of six grown children, I realize the importance of a playpen when babies start to explore their environment...we can't watch them every moment. I am now a grandmother who babysits for my daughter. I ordered this to use at my own home, and have had such a good experience with it that I ordered a second one for her to use at her house. The color is vibrant for lots of visual stimulation. The playpen is also a good size. Take it from this grandmother that this is definitely the best. 5 stars*****	3
This seat has worked very well for our 25-month-old boy.  Very easy to use and clean, and also easy to remove and replace to allow adults to use the toilet.  One caution: the splash guard in front will not always catch everything, especially if our son is not sitting centered and aligned with it, or if he moves around.  You'll need to watch out for this, and you'll likely have a little spillage from time to time.  Perhaps the next version can offer an expanded splashguard.  I still think this seat is very much worth buying.	3
I first purchased another bottle warmer which I promptly returned because it did not work.  I received this bottle warmer as a gift from a friend who has three children, two of which are twins.  So, I figured she knew what was good and what was not.  And she was right, this works well.  I read some of the other reviews of this product but can only say I've had no problems with this.  It's easy to use and always warms the bottle just right...not too hot, not too cold.  I'm very pleased with this product.	3
"I was surprised at just how large this tub was when I received it. Literally, my 3 year old can take a bath in it. He LOVES it, and calls it his ""boat"". It is really sturdy. it has both positions for infant and toddler, so really can last a long time. If you are NOT looking for something large, this is not the tub for you :-)If you have a smaller infant (which I always do), I would think adding a sponge insert will help to allow even the smallest baby to fit.We love it!"	3
This works pretty well to keep little hands from grabbing power strips. It also has the option of hanging it on the wall which I really like. The things I was not happy about was the quality of the plastic seems flimsy and also if you have to hook it on the last hole due to the size of your power strip it barely stays together. For our longest strip we had to duct tape around the entire device to make sure it stays together. Other than that it's a decent little contraption that does its job.	3
These are a huge hit with my one year old son.  We received these cars as a gift when my son was first born.  He started taking a real interest in them when he was about seven months old and still plays with them every day.  They are simple, durable, do not require batteries, and are easy to clean.  We've traveled a lot with my son and these make terrific travel toys as they pack up easily and don't take up much space since they nest.  The smallest car rattles and is the perfect size for little hands.	3
The Diaper Champ came easy to assemble- only took 2 minutes to put together!  The design is simple, yet brilliant, and the odors are sealed inside the Diaper Champ until the bag needs to be changed.  Our baby's room never smells!  We didn't even think about buying the Diaper Genie because we thought the idea of buying special bags and odor discs was ridiculous.  We normally use standard tall kitchen trash bags, but if you're into reusing plastic shopping bags you can even use them in the Diaper Champ (although you'd need to change the bag everyday...BUY IT!	3
I bought this potty after reading the reviews and trying to decide on the little or big potty.  I didn't think the small one would be a problem, since  my 18-month old son is on the small side.  However, after receiving it, I would only recommend this potty to those who are doing EC or for travel. My son seems to like it, but he looks huge on it and it will not last for long.  It also slides all over the tile floor like someone mentioned.  I really wish I would have bought the Bjorn big potty.	3
Since we practice elimination communication we looked for a potty that would work well for a young child who just began sitting with no (or very little) support. We started using this when our LO was 5.5months old. From the age of 6.5 months or so, our LO was really comfortable on this potty (it was OK earlier, but only for very short duration). It is very steady, and super easy to keep clean -- you just take out the inner compartment and wash it out. We are very happy with the decision to go with this model.	3
The only time I've had one of these sippy cups leak is from operator error.  I have two kids ages 4.5 and 2.5 and have used several different brands of sippy cups and these are by far the best.  I've gotten rid of most of the sippy cups in my house but did keep these around for when my 2.5 yr old wants a drink of water in her bed at night or if my neices or nephews need one when they come over.  I loved these so much, I couldn't bring myself to get rid of them!	3
While I agree these cups don't leak, they are difficult to get clean. The underside of the lid has crevasses around the mouth bit that are deep and narrow and almost impossible to get really clean.  I have been using ours for awhile and regularly sterilizing in boiling water, but the residue build up in the lid has gotten to the point where I have to toss them and buy new sippy cups. Too bad, as they are great in the no-leak department. I will be buying a kleen kanteen sippy--no leaks, stainless steel and easy to clean.	3
I have two very busy almost two year old twins who were fascinated with the power strip in their playroom. This cover isn't the most attractive thing, but works. They cannot reach into it or access anything, (not sure what hole people are talking about), and have left it alone.  It's about the size of a one liter soda bottle, and slides together/apart to extend the length. It is tall enough, but not quite long enough to secure together firmly on our extra long power strip. It still works however, and is the best solution I've found. Would recommend.	3
I'm so glad I chose the Playtex drop-ins system. It is so easy to use. I pump directly into the liners using the playtex storage set and freeze. Then I can just thaw and pop the liner onto the bottle holder and screw on the nipple. The selection of nipples was nice to have, though my guys would take any of them-he isn't picky. I haven't used the tall liners yet though, maybe that is more useful if you are formula feeding? For breastfeeding I recommend the pump and store set and you will be all ready to go!	3
What a disappointment!  We were so grateful to receive this at a baby shower- it was something we really wanted.  However, it did not live up to expectations.  The sound quality was awful- very, very quiet even on the highest volume setting and, even worse, extreme static.  I exchanged it for another one thinking that maybe the first was defective but had the same problems.  For such an expensive item the quality is very poor.We ended up ordering the Fisher Price Tape Player online and it is really wonderful.  We love it- buy it instead, better quality and cheaper!	3
This is a really great product... With just a little bit of water it sterilize everything really fast and it turn off by itself...And it's big enought to put almost everything you  want to... I really prefer this one instead of the microwave one because the other one is smaller, what means that you have to spend more electricity because you have to sterilize more times!!! And not even try to boil the bottles in the stove .... believe me, you would forget to turn it off... That has happend to me a thousand times in my mother's house!!	3
We've only used this tub a handful of times because our son is only 3 weeks old. I have not had any problems with the tub leaking. But like I said, we've only used it a handful of times. I definately don't think this tub is appropriate for small babies. The tub has absolutely no support for his head OR his body. It takes my husband AND I to bathe him b/c the tub offers no help. It would be just as easy to put him in our full size bath tub. I wouldn't recommend this tub for small babies.	3
When I opened the packaging I was appalled by the strong chemical smell of this mattress pad. I had to open the windows to get rid of the smell in the room even after I wrapped the pad back in plastic. I can't imaging my baby being in the same room with this product, let alone sleep on it! I also realized that there is no need to have a water proof mattress pad because most crib mattresses these days already come in a water proof cover. The non-waterproof cover I got was a much better choice for my baby.	3
Once you have this stool, you will use it long after you stop nursing. It is wonderful for just propping your feet up while reading, watching TV, doing needlework, and much more. I have a rocker/glider that I use in my front room and the gliding ottoman is just awkward and bulky. I was using a regular child's step stool but have had to tip it onto two legs and I'm starting to notice some wear on my carpet. It is also easier to pick up and move out of the way than the ottomans or switch to the couch.	3
I received this as a gift and I'm going to buy it for every expectant mother I know.  We attached this right to the side of the changing table that came with our pack and play and it holds everything you could possibly need while changing your baby.  We hated the thought of having diapers and supplies just laying around downstairs, but were not about to run upstairs to the nursery every time we needed to change the baby.  This solved the problem...everything is right at our fingertips for diaper changes.  It also keeps our dog from going after diapers!	3
After purchasing the depot, I found it does not work well on my changing table (dresser style with fold out top). I had to put it on the side and was not pleased to find out that it is not possible to use unless it is hung. More bad news... I purchased the Ultimate Wipes Warmer, which will not fit on top of the depot while it is hanging on the side of the changing table. Perhaps these products work fine with a typical changing table, but keep in mind they do not work with a folding top dresser type.	3
I LOVE this tub! The moulded shapes hold my baby nicely and allow me to have my hands free to bathe him properly. We have been using it since he was three weeks old and it still works well. We always lay a towel in the bottom to keep him from slipping around and for comfort. The drain on the side is a nice convenience and makes emptying it easy. The only issue is it's size, but we found that it fits perfectly under the crib and we store all of the baby toys, towels and baby bath products inside.	3
I read a review below that can explain exactly what we experienced. We've had it for 16 months and it has worked wonderful for us. No smells, change it out once a week, easy to clean. Then a diaper snagged this foam material in the head part, so I pulled the rest of the foam out. Big mistake!!! Now it can no loner retain the stinkiness and we're looking for a replacement. Be careful of overloading and never take out that foam piece that is cushioned between pieces. I have figured out that it is key to keeping the stink out.	3
This toy inspires me. I messed with it constantly when my son was an infant and too young to understand how to add and subtract instruments from the full orchestra sound. Now he gets the full functionality of the toy. It lasts for years, offering various entertainments to various ages of kids. Classical music is awesome for babies and little ones, so we love this. Warning, it's very heavy. Don't put it in your backpack when traveling to grandma's (we learned this lesson). The rubberized bumpers on the corners are fantastic for safety. We're never giving away this adorable musical toy.	3
This is a great toy.  My 7 month old daughter loves it and so do many of my musician friends.  There is one significant flaw in its design; this is that the volume is not adjustable and it is too loud.  If it were 1/2 this loud, I'd let me daughter play with it all the time.  As it is, I usually limit her to playing with it with me, so I can hold it away from her head/ears.Due to the too loud volume, I'm giving it a 4 star review, instead of 5.  Otherwise, it is a great, great product.	3
I used this table edge and corner guard to edge a window in my son's playroom. The window was level with the daybed he often played on, and I had visions of him cracking his head. I lined the edges of the windowsill. This works well. My son is a pretty good listener, and I kept telling him not to touch or pull the foam off, it was there for a reason, and it is still there two months later. It will come off very easily if pulled, just a forewarning. But I like this product and would use it again.	3
This was a lifesaver especially during the first couple of months.  Being a new mom (and dad) we were exhausted and I can't imagine trying to remember when the baby was last fed, changed, etc. without something like this by our sides 24 hours a day.  It is a good size and plenty of room to write everything down that you need.  It is laid out very well and easy to read/understand when handing off care from parent to parent (or whoever).  Once this ran out I bought another type of journal and am wishing I had just bought this one again.	3
Great product for our little one.  We put the baby tub in the big bath tub and our little one loves to take baths.  The first time we used it I had a hard time locking it but once I got it locked there were no problems.  I like the whole set up especially teh suction cups so it doesnt slide around, the sling to keep the baby laying on an incline is great too the perfect height to keep the baby happy.  It also has a removable bath ring, that she will be using when she can sit on her own.	3
We've tried several different potty seats and this is the best by far:1)  Fairly easy to clean, integrated design.  Love that it wipes clean if it gets messy2)  Built in pee guard for boys...  We had another seat with a snap on attachment, and of course it got lost while our daughter was using it.3)  very sturdy and stable on toilet.  This seat positively sits on the toilet, and my son is comfortable on it for even long periods of timeWe tried the soft plastic ones, and ironically he complained a lot more about those being uncomfortable than this one.  Highly recommended!	3
I had some of these that came with my Medela pump and like some other reviewers I thought they would be a good deal since I've really liked my Medela pump.  I really didn't like using them with the twist ties.  That didn't make sense to me at all.  I tried the First Years that have a zip-loc top and they've worked better.  They sit on their own and don't need to be set in a cup!I do prefer using bottles to store milk and have found the Mother's Milk Mate storage bottles to be a great cheap alternative for storage bottles.	3
So far my experience with T/Sal has been really good.  I alternate it with T/Gel.  Between the two it really drops the banhammer on dandruff.  I had such bad dandruff that I could not even wear a black shirt.  Now I can and will only see one or two flakes here and there.  That is pretty impressive.I've found it to be ineffective on my seborrheic dermatitis.  i need to use something else for that.  But for dandruff...awesome.	4
My grandson was visiting recently, he has such bad eczema, I was desperate!! I had this soap for awhile, and thoughtit couldn't hurt to try. I'm so glad I did, he wasn't scratching/itching or crying( he's 18 months). I was DESPERATE, toget him some relief, I can't say enough GOOD things about this soap. Except left no residue, no itching afterwards andthe biggest reward: he slept through the night! God bless your soap! I will DEFINITELY be reordering!	4
Bought this today at Publix (our local grocery) on clearance for $8.00.  I really didnt need a sunscreen, just a tinted moisturizer as I dont like to wear foundation in Fla. in the hot humid season.  I read the other reviews and (1) The texture is due to the spf30 and quickly absorbs into the skin.  (2) Dont buy this if you have very dry skin as it is a lighweight moisturizer.  The fair to light works fine for me.	4
I have been using this for a few weeks now.  I'm not noticing too much in the &#34;firming&#34; department yet, however I like the cream a lot.  I have very sensitive skin and this does not bother or irritate it at all.  The smell is pleasant and the cream goes on smooth.  I wake up &#34;fresh-faced&#34; without an oily sheen as I've expreienced using other night creams.  I'll keep watching on the &#34;firming&#34;, but I will definitely purchase this again.	4
Why haven't I been singing the praises of this little beauty of a mascara?!  I get courted away by $30+ mascaras that flake or never wash off!  Even the drugstore brands lured me away with their fancy brushes and promises of butterfly lashes.  No more!  This stuff doesn't flake, is inky and black, but can be removed w gentle soap and water.  My lashes actually feel conditioned after using this for a few days.  Do yourself a favor and buy this!	4
"I'm not sure if I got a faulty product, but the ""hot"" air was not hot. It was lukewarm at best. As such, it did nothing at all to my hair except make it extremely frizzy. No curls or waves.You might have more luck than I with this product. And because Amazon allows you to return this after you've opened it (I've already spoken to a rep and created a return tag), no harm in trying. It's just not for me."	4
I've been using this steamer for the last 9 years.  My first lasted about 8 years, but got a little crusty by the end of it.  The timer option is great so  I don't have to keep track of time.  This one includes a convenient measuring cup.  I wasn't crazy about the exfoliation tool (prefer to use a combo of Cetaphil and baking soda), but I guess it does the job.  I use the steamer about 2x a week for blackheads.	4
I not only don't see any difference after using almost the whole bottle, but it doesn't provide any temporary benefits either.  It makes my face look a little greasy, and there is not much of a cosmetic difference.  My skin doesn't really look better after I apply it.  But I have tried worse.  I don't think I will buy it again.  I'd rather try something else.  One thing though-it doesn't make my eyes burn like some other moisturizers with an SPF.	4
This is a basic make-up remover.  I forgot how thick it is.  It does a good job at removing my make-up.  You need to wipe it off with a face cloth or wet wipe to remove.  It will not come off with just a water splash.  It leaves my skin soft and dewey.  I would recommend to you if you like the extra removal step.  You wil need to follow with a toner to completely remove the residue from your skin.  Nice scent.	4
Bought this product at walmart for $10...  waste of money!!  I am mosltly platinum and had a few yellow tones and brassy streaks that I wanted toned out..  I've used feria before but just the darker brown colors.  It did tone out the yellow.. not so much the brass though....  the damage is horrid!!  It feels like it did the first day a bleached it from black..  save your money and your hair and go to sally's and get a quality lightening cream.	4
Good and cheap hair styling product! I tried it today after I blow-dried my hair. It was frizzy and hard to handle at the tips, as always. I looked like a troll. I turned this on and let it warm for a few minutes. I put 2 on each side and one on the crown. After a couple minutes I took them off and voila! Loose, sexy, and effortless Victoria's secret curls (:Would recommend to anyone, unless you're looking for a genuine curl.	4
I had difficult skin for many years before trying jojoba oil. This stuff is absolutely amazing, year round. Perfect for summer, winter, and every day. It's light, non-greasy, and leaves my skin feeling fresh and moist without any residue. I use it every day after I shower and it's the only thing that doesn't make me break out. It's also remarkably inexpensive, long-lasting, scentless, and natural. Highly recommended for anyone with skin issues or as a general purpose moisturizer for those with healthy skin.	4
The iron heats up quickly and seems to be good quality.  The buttons are well built, easy to understand and use.Like any curling iron, it does take quite a while to cool down, which is frustrating, but true with any product like this one.The cord is probably about 6 feet, which is a nice length to work with.  The cord is a little stiff, so it has curled a little too much now that it has been stretched a lot.Overall good product for the price.	4
My wife is writing this review for me:  I have tried all different eye makeup removers, either they are greasy or don't remove enough eye makeup or leave mascara behind.  This Maybelline remover works so very well, removes all of my makeup, doesn't leave my eyes greasy or leave remnants of mascara behind.  It even removes waterproof mascara.  I used Lancome for a while, and honestly, this works better and is so much less expensive.  Everyone should at least try it before buying expensive brands.	4
I've only recently started incorporating toner into my facial cleansing program, but this is my favorite that I've tried so far. This toner leaves my face feeling very clean, yet soft (not tight or itchy), plus it has the benefits of an Alpha and Beta hydroxy. It really does help keep my pores cleaner, and therefore smaller over time. I find it to be perfect for my combination/oily skin, but for those with dry or sensitive skin the alcohol might be irritating or overly drying.	4
For those of you that really wants a great facial steam, this product doesn't neccessarily perform the greatest. Its good but it doesn't cover the entire face. With a facial steam, you want to be able to cover the entire face --- in this case, I would suggest going to the gym where they have a STEAM ROOM. But again, this product is not a bad buy... i just don't use it much after 1-2 uses.. because i don't think the effect is really great.	4
The first one arrived & the facial sauna worked fine, but the little facial scrubber didn't.  Amazon replaced the entire package and everything works fine.  Is it like going to the spa and getting a facial?  No.  But then I didn't pay as much for this little device as the spa paid for the one they use.  The steam isn't a lot, it's gentle.  I did put a towel over my head & that helped.  The sinus attachment works well.  I am pleased with the purchase.	4
This product didn't work for me, but that's not to say it will not work for you. My issues with this product was that I burned my fingers each time I tried to put the roller in my hair, you only get a few clips with the product and they didn't work very well--At least they didn't work well for me. I gave this product away and even that person didn't want it. I may be a fan of some Conair products, just not this one.	4
I live this product - it is great as a moisturizer and isn't too heavy for my oily skin. I love the scent but, unfortunately, I think that is what made my skin tingle when I first started using it. The tingle has gone away, for the most part, but people with sensitive skin or people (like me) who use things like Retin-A that make their skin sensitive, take note. I think next time I'll try the Olay Pro-X Age Repair Lotion or the Total Effects 7-In-1.	4
I have had a really  hard time finding an acne cleaning body wash that I like. They either smell terrible or leave my skin feeling filmy. For me this is the second best smelling one out there. It could, however, do without the silly little pink beads in the soap.I prefer Neutrogena's Stress Control Body Wash for scent but I have a hard time finding it. It seems to be gentler as well. This, however, is really the only substitution if you can't find the Stress one.	4
Olay Total Effect's facial lotion is an excellent everyday lotion.  It goes on smoothly and a little goes a long way.  It has no fragrance and absorbs quickly.  The one issue I have is that it leaves me looking a bit shiny.The bottle that it comes in is small and travels well.  It's easy to pump out the exact amount that you need.I have combination sensitive skin and I've not noticed and issues or breakouts.  I've been using it for about a month now with good results.	4
I started to break out in a rash under my arms. HUH ? So, I tried letting it all clear up, but every time I used an anti-perspirant again... BLAM ! IT WAS BACK. I eat a lot of veggies and herbs. I really can't do without an anti-perspirant. Deodorants only mix with the odor and get more potent during the workday. I was DESPARATE. Almay is THE answer. No more rash, no more odor. Whew. The things we take for granted until something changes. Thanks, Almay	4
I read the detailed report on wrinkle creams done by Consumer Reports.  They tested out all the top wrinkle creams out there.  The result: None produced significant results, but Olay Regenerist was the best.  If you have fine lines and unevenness due to dry skin, then this will help, no doubt, BUT it will not undo your wrinkles.  It's a great moisturizer, but I am concerned about all the synthetic chemical ingredients in this product.  After using this product, I'm switching over to something safer, more natural.	4
I put in my sons bathroom & he's as picky as me.  This doesn't leak out all over the tub like I thought it would.  I just knew when I hung it & went to clean his bathroom, there would be residue from whatever was coming out of this dripping on to the tub underneath it.  I am happy to say, there is NONE!  Easy to install & this thing isn't moving, installed with silicone which I love.  Easy to refill as well. A+ for this little mechanism!	4
It does not smell like sesame oil at all, which is good. Not like the smell of food. It actually has a very pleasant smell.  Oil is not too thick.  Nice to apply after a bath, but you can also put some on the tub when relaxing. Wife and I are using it especially more often during the winter.  It helps you to stay a little bit warm.  Helps your skin to keep it from drying.  Not bad to use for massage, but kinda expensive for that purpose.	4
"You might not like this product if you have oily skin, since we ""people with oily skin"" are used on using products that would make our skin dry to dry out pimples and such.. this product leaves a satin finish on your skin, and i found that my nose gets oily after couple of hours, i did not like that.  However it is a good cleanser, it cleans makeup without having to rub it too hard on your face like other soups. it also smells like Johnson&Johnson baby shampoo."	4
I have trouble with sunscreen causing breakouts and this almost never causes blemishes.  I also have come to hate the smell of typical sunscreen and this doesn't have that smell.  I have light to medium tone Caucasian skin with some yellow undertones and this is so thick it can double as foundation makeup.  It says it dries clear, but it's a little chalky and would probably really look bad if you have dark or ethnic skin.  I have read that the tinted kind doesn't blend well with Asian skin.	4
Like all Mrs. Meyer's products, which make doing chores a little less onerous with their lovely essential oil scents, the dish soap smells great. Basil and radish are my personal faves, though it's hard to pick just one. The dish soap, however, doesn't work up any suds....making it difficult to do the dishes manually without using a ton. And this stuff isn't cheap. So I'll just be sticking to regular Dawn for the dishes, and leave Mrs. Meyer's for the countertop spray and the abrasive cleaner for my bathroom.	4
I had meant to order the SPF version, which comes out of the pump a white color.  This is a creamy-whitish.  Nothing wrong with that, but I need the SPF coverage and I actually use it to lighten up my light tinted moisturizer...I'm kinda pale, so I will stick with the SPF next time.  That said, I still use this sometimes at night or if I know I will be bumming around the house all day with no fun-in-the-sun.  It is lightweight and, like all Neutrogena products, of high quality.	4
I don't know why they call this &#34;Plus Touch of Sun&#34; as I took that to mean it had self-tanner or bronzer in it - but it does nothing really for color. It's not a bad moisturizer at all- I just haven't found the 'touch of sun' in it. This may be because I tan easily and there isn't enough of a &#34;touch of Sun&#34;. In other words I find this no better than other moisturizers which don't promise as much as this one does but I still like it	4
After buying Olay Regenerist Regenerating Serum Moisturizer at a local store, I found I liked it better than any other facial product.  It is not greasy, there is no fragrance that I can detect, and it easily allows a bit of makeup if desired.  EIght pumps of the bottle and that will cover my neck and face for the entire day.  For anyone who does not want heavy or expensive products, this is the one.  I like it so much that I added it to my recurring Amazon.com order list.	4
makes my face more oily and the smell of tea tree is horrible. Didn't help much on pimples but it did excellent on my skin tag, yehey. I just soak my skin tag with a dot of the cream and cover it w/ bandage overnight. I did it for I think 3-4consecutive days then after that, the skin tag became painful and turned black. I tried to pull it but it's very painful so I left it. THe following day, it fell off by itself, and it's gone, THank God!!	4
I have very, VERY breakout-prone skin, and this serum has yet to cause any problems for me. It's smooth and light, and I feel like my skin has looked smoother since I've started using it. I don't think it's made much of a difference for any marks or blemishes on my skin, but the texture of my skin looks better now. With the warmer weather, I've been using it alone (without any other moisturizer) at night and it's doing a great job on its own of keeping my skin moist.	4
I have been using Obagi foaming gel for years and is, by far, the best face cleanser on the market.  It does not dry out your face, but it removes every bit of make-up.  I have tried other brands, but when you follow with a toner, the cotton pad always ends up looking like I never washed my face first.  This product removes all traces of make-up and never dry out your skin.  As long as I use this product daily - I have less break-outs and no dry patches.	4
I rarely see copper colors in the drugstores so I was happy to find this on Amazon. I've been coloring my hair red for years but I have found that the coppery reds are much more flattering. And as I tend to leave the mixture on longer than required as i usually get distracted, this does not leave reddish- purply tones. When I colored my hair today I left in on for an hour and it looks rich and gorgeous. Feria colors don't seem to fade as fast either. Great product.	4
Smell is so subjective it seems that it may not be a valid review point. One person may love the smell of something and another person hate it. That being said, I like the smell of the citrus body wash. It has a faint scent of oranges and is sweet. It doesn't dry out my skin as much as other soaps do. It makes mounds of lather, so a little goes a long way. The ingredients listed on the product page are incorrect; it does not contain lauryl or laureth sulfates.	4
"This stuff is terrible.  It makes my skin break out because it leaves a waxy residue on your face after you wash it off that clogs my pores.  Also, the ""microbeads"" are a joke - you can barely tell they're there and they don't help exfoliate at all.  Worst of all is that this scrub is like a gel, and I prefer scrubs that are like a cream.  To top it off, it does not ""brighten"" or even out my skin tone at all.  I would not buy this garbage again."	4
I received this item on time. Well, I should rephrase. I received something I didn't order on time and in great condition! I received a product in the Sun Kissed Caramels line of products when I ordered an ASH brown. Ash is not caramel. I'm scared to use it and guess what? I CAN'T RETURN IT BECAUSE APPARENTLY IT'S HAZARDOUS. I will, however, enjoy the conditioner that was included and might consider re-purposing the developer. Just not with a caramel color. Caveat emptor, you won't get what you ordered. Fail, Amazon.	4
The color is pretty, but no where near the color on the box.  It is a mahogany/red color.  Much deeper and quite red.  There is NO gold.  I am disappointed with how dark and how red the color is.  The grey covered very well (which is why it gets 2 stars instead of 1).  I don't really like the formulation -- the gel colorant is quite drippy. I also like that it only takes 25 minutes to process.  I might try it again if I had confidence about the color choice.	4
I brought this camping and both guys and gals used this.  It smells fresh, like you've taken a shower with regular shampoo, feels refreshing when going on.  The directions say to soak your hair, massage it in and then towel dry. I have a lot of hair but still have a decent amount left (it was used by 5 adults).  It does make your hair look smooth and it does make if feel like there's product in your hair (like gel) but it's much, much better than going without a shower.	4
I've tried more expensive lotions and creams on my face, but I really love this one the best.  It leaves my face feeling and looking very soft.  I also love the way you just press the top and the lotion/cream comes out....you don't have to dip your fingers in a jar or touch what's left in it.  All creams and lotions should be this way...I hate having to dig out cream in a jar with my fingers not knowing if I've left any germs in the remaining cream.  I recommend this.	4
My skin is pretty resilient and not easily irritated, with that being said I started with one a day but quickly moved up to two. I use this between my CeraVe foaming cleanser and my CeraVe moisturizer and they've been working very well so far. They are pretty cheap and this order came with three boxes, but if you want the most bang for your buck you can cut these pads in half. I generally don't use the entire pad so half is perfect and now you have 540 uses for ~$11.	4
So i was a bit skeptical about this product at first. I tried it for a whole week and let me tell you-brighten skin tone-acne going away-old acne scars fading-new acne scars fading-softnes-smoothnessI just dont really like the smell. I did a patch test as they said. It burns on acne marks alil but no harm just working.How I use it before I go to bed i apply a peas size that all. I even started using it for my toes knuckles they have gotten hard from last summer.. and its helping!!	4
Maybelline Volum' Express Mascara is so much better than Great Lash.  It goes on evenly and lengthens without clumping.I always use my mascara long past the three month suggested shelf life and it doesn't get dried out very quickly.  (However using mascara after six months puts the user at a risk of infection, so be warned.)And it really is waterproof.  You'll need a reliable mascara remover if you want it to come off your lashes.  I've sat through tear-jerkers wearing Volum' Express and come out without a smudge (much less racoon eyes!)	4
I used to use a moisturizer from Yves Rocher but it got too expensive and it was only 1.7 oz.This product is amazing and is much better than what I was using. It makes your skin so soft but yet the acne is kept at bay. I haven't had any acne since I have been using this product which is an amazing 2 weeks!This product is very affordable and I love that it is 4 oz.I use this moisturizer with the Aveeno Clear Complexion Bar. These 2 products are really great together.	4
Since I have baby fine hair that is kind of hard to curl, I purchased the 3/4 inch model of this Instant Heat Brush. What amazes me about this brush is that it heats up so quickly but does not overheat.So far, I have not forgotten to turn it off, yet I am so glad to know that it has an auto turnoff.One more thing I want to add: This does not tangle up in my hair and gives my hair softness and curl. And this brush is easy to clean also.	4
This product feels okay on the skin but leaves a highly visible white film on the skin.  I'm not sure if it is apparent on other races but it is very noticeable on African American skin tones. It looks like I've applied cheap foundation shades too light on my face.I cannot wear it outdoors in front of people during the day (and I'm cheap! :) ) so I use it as my night time moisturizer before bed. Imagine using an SPF moisturizer only to bed...Will not repurchase once I've used it all.	4
I have dry, sensitive skin. I've tried a number of cleansers like this one (Cetaphil, Ponds cold cream, Boots cleansing lotion, etc.) and this one seems to work the best. It takes make up off well and doesn't leave behind a 'filmy' feeling if you just wipe off.  If you do rinse with water, it doesn't leave you with a tight, squeeky-clean feeling. It really does leave your skin feeling moisturized and yet cleanses enough to get rid of the dirt and make-up!  I'm very happy with this cleanser and will purchase again.	4
I've found this cleanser does a great job of removing light to moderate oil/dirt from the skin without overdrying.  It is a cream based cleanser with no abrasives in it, so it's very gentle on the skin as well.I usually rub a little bit on my skin with my hands, then wash it off with water.  This is good for when you just need a light cleansing.  You can put a little on a wash rag, then rub your skin with the rag if you need a more robust cleaning.Overall a great product.	4
I like this mask a lot. I wanted something a little less drying than my purifying mint mask and since this has avocado in it I thought it would be a nice alternative. It's very nice and applies easily and my skin feels softer after I use it without feeling like it's stripped me of all moisture. Don't get me wrong, it's not the same effect as using a moisturizer or anything - you're still going to lose some moisture - but it's not nearly as drying as some masks I've used before.	4
I live in a very sunny desert area, and this lotion has worked great as my daily UV protection.  Does not make your face look greasy, and has no scent, so folks cannot even tell I have it on.  When I used it in a more humid environment, however, it did sweat off into my eyes fairly readily. So not recommended as your primary protection for sports or swimming, and be ready for it to sweat off and sting your eyes in more hot and humid climes.  But for drier areas, works great.	4
I started a new skin regimen recently, retinol cream, AHA 8% cream and this Olay Regenerist Daily Serum, and I'm amazed that I can see a difference already, in a week. My skin is smoother and healthier looking and even a little tighter, altho there is not yet a huge difference in that department. Still, I recommend this as part of your skin care regimen because it seems to give the others a boost. I useOlay Complete All Day UV Moisturizer, SPF 15, Sensitive Skin, 6 Ounce (Pack of 2)every day, as well.	4
Absolutely love this cream.  I have combination skin with oily t-zone but my skin dries out near my cheeks, near my eyes and chin.  I use this cream twice a day--once at night after a shower and once in the morning after washing and cleaning my face.  A lesser moisturizer would result in dry skin by lunchtime but this cream really keeps my skin moist and soft.  Super safe around eyes and works into skin really well.  No added scents!  I've tried lots of different moisturizers and this one is by far the best.	4
I love these but feel a bit profligate ordering something I could probably concoct at home. There appears to be some mild soap, witch hazel and aloe applied to compressed fiber pads which are disposable....Not very green. I use them more than once because they lather so richly and after two uses, I clean my sink and vanity with them. They don't strip my skin of all of its oils and leave my face feeling fresh without any irritation. The only improvement would be to have the lotion and use my own wash cloths....	4
I couldn't wait to get this eye pillow. I read the reviews and was hoping that the scent wasn't too overpowering. Well it came last night, I opened the box expecting a beautiful scent of lavender and I can BARELY smell the scent. I don't know if I just received one that was older or what, but when I used it last night the lavender was so faint that even holding it up to my nose didn't work. I love the fabric and it's very well made, just doesn't smell...is there something you can do?	4
This calming gel will soothe your skin. I found a small sample in a sample kit and was impressed with the ingredients. Peppermint, Lavender, Rosemary, Safe, Aloe Vera, Witch Hazel, Tea Tree, Chamomile, Camphor and Bergamot oil top the list for healing.This formula helps to neutralize any bacteria and is especially good for oily skin. You can use this over your entire face or just for spot treatment.Also look for Pore Shrink Deep Pore Cleansing Mask and the Start Up Exfoliating Face Wash.I'd like them to make these containers twicethe size, at least.~The Rebecca Review	4
I have been using the L'Oreal Preference, Lightest Golden Brown shade for many years now, and still get compliments on the golden highlights and how healthy my hair looks. The color is always consistent and natural looking and the coverage very effective, though with the increasing amount of gray in my natural hair, I have to be careful with the application, particularly around the temples and where I part my hair. Now, if the product could only make my face look as smooth and wide-eyed as the model, I would give it 10 stars !	4
I have used this product before except I bought it at my hair salon.  That one worked well.  So well, that I decided to buy again except I saw this one online and it was cheaper.  But, this one purchased online got all over my hands as soon as I touched my hair lightly, got on my shirt when I pulled it over my head, dripped down the side of my face when I perspired.  Awful.  Wish I could return it but I didn't pay that much so let's just say its one lesson learned.	4
I am 45 and this stuff works.  I have used a lot of different products since my teens.  I have NEVER been disappointed with Alpha products.  Simply they work.  Alpha product lines tend to fly low in an already over stimulated market of commercials and new product wonders that appear in constantly in an ever changing money making industry devoted to our own vanity (present company included).  But these products work!  I can testify to that.  The best thing is they are high in concentrate and low in price that is an A+++ in my book.	4
I was using Aveeno Skin Complexion Skin Care before I tried this one. In preparation for the summer, I thought I would get an Aveeno product with SPF. Unfortunately, I got 3 big pimples after I started using this Aveeno product. When I returned to the Aveeno product I used before, my skin  cleared up, and honestly, my skin hasn't looked this great in a long time. So I guess this a recommendation for Aveeno Skin Complexion Care b/c I'd rather not have pimples. I still have the almost-full, used bottle of this stuff. Oh well...	4
This is a fantastic product! I cannot wash my hair without it.  I am so used to this towel sucking up all the extra water that when I just use a normal bath towel it actually feels weird to have all the excess water in my hair.  This also cuts down on a lot of blowdryer time too. I have fine, medium length hair and this works fantastic for me.  I highly, highly recommend this for anyone who wants to save time on drying their hair in the morning and get out of the door faster.	4
I had a curling iron with teeth (only way I know to describe it) about 30 years ago.  It disappeared somewhere along the way, and I have wished I could find another one for a few years now.  But I never found one in any store.  Then I came across this one on Amazon.  I love it.  It accomplishes the same thing as the old one, which is to smooth out my hair after I have blow-dried it without adding unwanted curl.  Of course, you can use it to curl your hair if that's your pleasure.	4
This serum by Olay is wonderful!  It makes my skin look luminous, it has helped my crow's feet, and laugh lines.  It blends in easily, is not greasy at all, and my skin soaks it up. I wear it day and night.  It makes my make up glide on, and helps keep my make up in place.  I really like the way this serum makes my skin feel: hydrated, smooth, soft, but not greasy or oily.  It gives a nice matte finish to my face.  I will use this serum as long as Olay makes it!	4
I really enjoyed the perfect spiral curls this curling iron made.  It took me a couple tries to finally get it right.  I give it four stars only because it took about double the time it takes me to use a clipless wand, and for some reason even though I had it on the highest heat setting and used hairspray, my spirals became loose waves after a few hours (They were still pretty waves though!).  I will most likely use this as a back up or for special occassions only because it was so time consuming.	4
I have tried many products in the lip balm category, and most of them have let me down. As a male, I don't care for the usually disgusting fruity varieties. All I want is something that moisturizes, protects, and relieves my lips without being distracting. The Neutrogena Norwegian Forumula Lip Moisturizer does all of the above. It feels very smooth and thin and you forget that you have it on. The SPF 15 is essential for anti-aging too. I recommend buying this lip moisturizer if you want great results without the distractions of the other brands.	4
I have been using moisturizer from all stretches of the earth. NuSkin to dead sea to japanese products to Exuviance. This one moisturizes very well. The thing about less-expensive moisturizers are that they do the same job, but they are thicker. I have been having drier skin, overall after using this for a year, so I'm not sure if the long term benefits are good. My skin looks older but I don't think it is due to this product or just aging. This product is a bit too much for summertime, if you have an oily/shiny t-zone.	4
I wanted a coppery orange color and i had dyed black hair so i picked this up to strip the color out (this is something i've done before with other brands with no problem) however, this formula is so crazy thick it didnt spread at all and my hair turned out so splotchy because of it. This product was not meant to be your standard bleaching kit, its for people with already light hair who want to go lighter, If your dark like me and wanted to go lighter i suggest manic panic bleaching kit or splat.	4
"The product name ""Stress Relief Body Wash"" says it all. This wonderful product, put out by Aveeno, does the job. Made with wonderful ingredients, like lavender, chamomile and ylang-ylang, you feel the stress of the day melt off of your body. Its special soap free formula gets the job done, in addition to the wonderful addition of oatmeal, as a base. It smells heavenly, without being tacky or overly perfumed. Please use this if you need a lift, or, simply a release from day-to-day pressure. This is good as a companion item to any shower in America......"	4
I never taken care of my face as I should so I ordered a jar of this to start the process. Turning 30 is boring and hard. so far this has been a really, really great choice!! I have very sensitive skin and I get little to no breakouts and this lotion has been a perfect balance to keep that consistent. I've tried other lotions that claimed to be amazing (I'm looking at you Lush) and have either broken out of the ingredients have dried my skin out drastically.I will buy this again and continue to use it.	4
I recently bought two gorgeous colors of Revlon lipstick: Fabulous Fig and Highbeam Tan. I was pleased to discover that the Fabulous Fig rates surprisingly safe on the EWG Skindeep site, but the Highbeam Tan has a poor score and is full of parabens and other junk. It's too bad, because Highbeam Tan is such a fantastic color. I wish companies like Revlon would clean up the ingredients in their products. It isn't that hard, or that expensive, to make lipstick that contains safer ingredients. The Fabulous Fig vs. the Highbeam Tan is a perfect example of this.	4
"This didn't put out much steam, and wasn't very hot. Maybe it's because I'm in the mountains and water produces steam at a lower temp. up here. Anyway, I had a better facial with a pot of boiling water, and had to return this. UPDATE 2011: Want steam??? Use a ""My little steamer"" mini clothing steamer!!! CAUTION: Keep at least 12-15 inches away from your face.  I used distilled water, and this thing really puts out steam, and in less than a minute too! Remember...do not put it too close to your face!!! It generates VERY HOT STEAM!!!"	4
I have tried other foaming cleansers and they usually are foam in my hand but when I put them on my face they just dissolve! I really like how this one lathers up! It makes my skin feel very soft! I use my Befine Exfoliating Cleanser with Brown Sugar, Sweet Almond and Oats and then I use this afterwards because I have combination to oily skin and acne prone skin around that time of the month for us ladies! The combination of using those two together makes my skin look and feel great! I would highly recommend it!	4
I purchased this item not really knowing mud about it, just read up whatever it said on the tube. I decided to go ahead andbuy it.I LOVE LOVE LOVE this item. It feels very refreshing and cooling on the skin. Has a peppermint scent. However, not an overpowering one.Makes my face feel very smooth and clean after I take this off. I use this about 1-2 a week and i really enjoy it. Works wonderfully for me.I recommend this item if your looking for a refreshing masque, that will clean your face, and make you feel very refreshed!	4
For a lip gloss, the pigmentation and staying power is pretty great. Once it dries, it stays put and doesn't feel sticky (no more hair sticking to your lips on a windy day!).Just a head's up: it seems to form a plasticky coating on your lips that tends to peel/flake off, instead of just fade away. If I gently rub my lips together when wearing this, it literally forms little clumps that flake off. I wouldn't recommend this for people who tend to have dry lips. If that doesn't bother you, go ahead and give this a try.	4
i went to the drugstore looking for queen helene's mint julep mask, but i couldn't find it, so i picked this up instead. i really like this mask as well, it leaves my skin feeling really clean and soft and it's very easy to rinse off. i have sensitive skin and i haven't had any breakouts or adverse reactions to it after using it. the only things i don't like about it are that it makes my eyes burn a lot if i put too much of the product around them, and it's a little itchy when it dries.	4
As a young woman who has lost a lot of hair due to thyroid problems, I have tried a few products with mixed success.  This product isn't even marketed towards hair loss but I gave it a try...and it actually works!  I started with the extra strength shampoo but switched to regular (less stinky, still effective).  My hair loss stopped completely and even started growing back!  The shampoo does smell awful, but it works!  I just rinse really well and use a lot of shampoo.  It leaves my hair soft, clean, and shiny.  I will definitely keep using this product!	4
I am using this in tandem (switching nights) with other products that provide chemical exfoliation for my horrible skin, so it is hard for me to speak about its effectiveness specifically. That said, I do know that I have had no problems with this product. I was concerned that it would irritate my skin, as I am certainly prone to irritation and redness,  but I have had no such issues at all. It seems to be the gentlest of the products that I use. My skin is looking (relatively) fantastic lately, and this probably has something to do with it!	4
I used to use the Neutrogena moisturizer for sensitive skin, but decided to try this since my skin does tend to be oily. The lotion itself is very thin. Instead of my normal one application, with this lotion I need to apply twice, otherwise my face is dry and flaky--once after getting out of the shower, and another time before putting on my make up. The 2 stars is for the fact that my skin does look and feel good using this lotion, but there are plenty others that do just as good a job with just half the amount.	4
I'm only 5 months pregnant but I have no stretchmarks (so far), no itchy belly, and it's kept dryness to a minimum in this cold weather. I use it once a day after the shower, all over. I've been using it since I was 3 months pregnant. I took off one star because it's a big oilier than I'd like, but I did try another (more expensive, lighter oil, mamma mio) product and I started seeing dryness, so I switched back to this Mother's Special Blend. The initial smell is nice (chocolately!) but it goes away in a few minutes.	4
I have been using Olay products for a number of years, and at 67 years of age, I don't have any wrinkles on my face, neck, or upper chest. This could, of course, be due to heredity because my 94 year old mother doesn't have much in wrinkles either. There is really no way to know for sure, but I do like the feel of this product on my skin. When I use it, my skin feels soft and moisturized, and not greasy as it does with some other products. I will continue to use this and other Olay products.	4
I am very impressed with the results which happened after taking this just one week. After doing some research about safe methods to reduce hot flashes, I came upon this product. There are many studies done mostly in Europe, and they are very positive. I had 5 to 6 hot flashes every night, robbing me of a good night sleep. Now I have maybe 1 hot flash every 3-4 nights. This really worked for me. I will be taking this for a very long time. Studies also show that this supplement helps retain bone density, and helps with mood swings.	4
I do not use after shave and instead opt to use this product. It seems to help with moisture, any cuts, doesn't sting, helps with breakouts, etc. It really is a great product but it does have that tea tree smell that does NOT really disappear. I get whiffs of it off/on during the entire day. I hardly doubt that others will smell it unless they're licking your cheek but you will be able to smell it. I'd rather have great skin with a medicinal scent that isn't all that bad!! This is great product at a very reasonable price!	4
I'm nearly 25 and still get moderate breakouts. The worst part are the red marks that hang around for weeks even after the blemish is gone. This product is not only keeping my skin clearer, thus avoiding more red marks, it's also fading the red marks that were already there. My face hasn't been this clear in a long, long time. I use it once in the morning and once at night. It goes on nice and light under makeup - I can't even tell it's there. I ordered one for my sister after having such great success with it myself.	4
I have tried everything and beside Olay for face, this is the very best. I use it on my body and face, along with the Olay, and the results are wonderful. My skin is soft, not greasy, dewy, plump and zitless. This lotion might be a little heavier than some but my skin likes it. If u have dry or allergy-prone skin, this is for you. I tried a cheaper lotion a few weeks ago and ran back to this. Cetaphil makes several varations, so any skin need can be met. Excellent for ppl like me who hate fragrances! So great.	4
I don't use too much makeup, maybe concealer sometimes, but my skin is super duper oily. So even if I use a sunblock, after a few hours, my skin will be very oily. So I use this sheets to remove the oil from my face. Its very easy to use- just take a sheet from the package and press it against your skin and that's it! The sheet will turn transparent as soon as it absorbs the oil from your skin. It saves so much time since applying powder foundation to your skin after every 2-3 hours is such a hassle.	4
This has been a beauty staple of makeup artists and mascara fans for years and I cannot for the life of me figure out why. I guess if you're lookin for a mascara to give your lashes a darker color and nothing more, you'd be satisfied with this. But most women buy mascara to lengthen and/or thicken their lashes and this just doesn't do that. It doesn't clump, but it also doesn't do anything else for your lashes. I really tried to give it a chance but it ended up in the garbage. Such a waste. Good thing it's pretty cheap.	4
"Maybe I'm missing the bandwagon (no pun intended), but all these reviews that say ""amazing"", ""best book I've ever read"", etc.??  I don't get that.  I was drawn to the story and the characters, and it was well-written.  It was an easy read, so I finished it in a day and a half.  However, I don't consider it anything more than a fun read--something good for the beach or the plane. I'm defintely not seeing the hype."	5
I honestly didn't know what to expect when I started WATER FOR ELEPHANTS, but as I continued on hour after hour, I realized what a terrific book it is!  Set in post-Depression America and the Benzini Brother's Circus, WATER FOR ELEPHANTS is full of emotions and flashes of great humor. All the characters, including the animals, all have pivotal roles throughout the story. This book is a great blend of history, mystery, love story and memoir.Highly recommend with 5 stars!!!	5
"Being a born horse-lover, I have read Sara's previous books about horses.  I loved them.  When I heard she had written another book-I just had to read that too.  Her writing style is very readable.  You become immersed in the characters.  ""Water For Elephants"" is a book for all generations.  I had both my daughters read it.  We all fell in love with the main character, Jacob.  I can't say enough good things about this wonderful heartwarming book.  Highly recommend!"	5
"This book is quite funny.  Especially when you read it fast as I'm always requested to do.  How fast can you read, ""big brown bear, blue babboon, beautiful babboon blowing bubbles, biking backward, bump black bug's banana boxes..."" And and it goes from there!  It's really fun to read aloud and plus it's easy for little ones to memorize.  A very cute book, and a very easy way to teach the letter 'b'.  Great book - ours gets taken to bed!"	5
I really learned a lot about the circus, the good and bad parts, and have such a great appreciation of all of the work that goes on behind the scenes.  Plus, giving the characters a &#34;real&#34; life and personality, made it all the more interesting.  I loved Rosie, the elephant - such &#34;humanness&#34; in her attitude and loving nature.  I liked the way, as an old man, he was able to reflect and recall his vivid youth working in the circus.	5
With vivid, descriptive prose, Hemingway takes us into the mind of a soldier.  Focused on duty and his mission, our main character encounters love among the carnage, but even that does not sway him from his duty.  Though at times a bit long-winded, Hemingway brings the internal battle of war to the surface.  The self-talk that goes on shows the conflict behind the rough exterior.  We also see the useless deaths that take place because of the uncertainties that come with war.	5
I was given this book by a writer friend who called it &quot;the most beautiful book I've ever read.&quot; So, since she and I have similar literary tastes, I was inclined to read it. This little book, written in a rich, colorful, deep, and wise poetic style, is full of some of the most moving and impressive spiritual phrases and messages I've ever read. It was written in 1923 but its poetry and wisdom are timeless.David Rehakauthor of &quot;Poems From My Bleeding Heart&quot;	5
I was hesitant to read this book since it felt like everyone I knew who raved about it was a middle-aged lady and I didn't think it'd have enough action to keep my attention.  To my pleasant surprise, the writing was just brash enough to make me want to keep reading, often laughing out loud at the bizarre pseudo-autobiography.  I recommend it as a quick, easy, summer read.  Yes, a bit on the chick-lit side of the spectrum, but very good just the same.	5
I am not a big fan of books on tape.  My husband is...on long trips we listen. If you dont mind listening to an old man with wet phlegm in his throat for hours ...go for it.  Since I picked this tape based on the reviews from Amazon I suffered through 5 dvd's so far. The story is not interesting or enlightening. A bad story can be read thru rather quickly but on tape listening at a horribly slow pace....well  ...it is like water torture.	5
Reading a classic such as &quot;The Prophet&quot; is much more fruitful when it is revisited often, the lessons are applied and the reader reads as if Gibran is writing only to him or her.Sitting with this book in your hands can be like sitting across from Gibran, listening to him speak.  The accompanying art work also by Gibran gives it yet another rich element and peek into the soul of this incredible writer.Listen, embrace and breathe in these words.Open your mind and heart to The Prophet.	5
I can't say it was bad but it sure wasn't good. I have had the book for many years and just got around to reading it. Major disappointment considering the hype and accolades. It had the potential to be much better, but it was trite and lagged all the way through, for the most part. I'm mystified by the massive attention. It, in my opinion, is mediocre, at best. 3 stars is the max I can give it. Great literature it's not. Sophomoric comes to mind.	5
I enjoyed this book so much, I did not want the story to end.  Alternately told between the main character as a youth and reminiscing as an old man.  This takes you back to a time when the world was a lot simpler, if you remember the time when a circus would show up in your small town and just as quickly disappear.  The end is a gem, won't spoil it for those who have not read it.  I couldn't put it down, just pure entertainment.	5
"I'm not one to read historical pieces, mostly because I don't think I'll relate to the people and times, but this book is an exception. An exceptional exception! I loved ""Water for Elephants."" Tragedy, mystery, adventure, humor and romance -- this book has it all. This is the story of a young man who finds himself working as a veterinarian for a traveling circus during the Great Depression era, but it's really so much more. So, step right up, ladies and gentlemen, and enjoy this masterpiece!"	5
The story was good but had too many swear words for my taste. The circus storyline was very interesting (ie, how a circus works, what happens behind the scenes, etc). I was also surprised to find a good description of getting old. If you're interested in reading just that part of the book, skip the chapters with pictures at the beginning. In doing so, you'll also skip most of the foul language.I've given this book 3 stars, but it really should be 2 and a half.	5
Probably the most boring scifi book. A lot of politics, very dull and boring descriptions about Mars ecology. Many text books are more interesting reading than this book.The plot is boring. Characters are dull, annoying, and uninteresting. There is no great character development here folks. Did I mention that the book is extremely boring. Don't waste your time with it unless you are stuck in an airport with nothing else to read, actually just go to sleep, and have some rest instead of reading this book.	5
Like others, I had initial issues getting hooked on this critically acclaimed novel, especially as I had just read my way through a glut of scifi page turners. In short, it takes some gear switching but if you enjoy hard scifi & exemplary writing, Red Mars is worth your time.  Once I relaxed into the slow rhythms of the story, I was simply awed.  So much so, I ended up reading the whole trilogy and enjoyed each successive book more than the last.  Immensely satisfying read.	5
"I just finished this book, and oh my word, what a fun, very quick read :-)  The story was wonderful and I loved the back and forth from the ""old"" Jacob to the ""young"" Jacob, the the past reality, to the current reality.The detail of the writing was so descriptive that I felt like I was in the hobo ""city"" or seeing the high trestle that Walter & Camel were thrown off of. It was just an amazing story, I'd suggest it to anyone, at any age."	5
I had read Without Remorse more than ten years ago and came upon it again as an audio-book. I do a lot of driving and find a story well researched, well written, and well read, a pleasure that makes the investment in driving time easy. Traffic jams, and delays are now endurable.John Clark is a man focused upon Justice. He makes the effort to identify the problem and those responsible then sets about to correct the situation without lawyers. The world needs more men like John Clark.	5
This is one of the best, most inspiring philosophy/poetry books ever written!  I have read it over and over, though never tire of it.  It is a great reminder for what's most important in life and puts everything in perspective.  My favorite 'chapters' are Love, Marriage, Children and The first look. I am a romantic though, so the other chapters may appeal to you more....;-)  Absolutely classic and timeless.  Perfectly stands the test of time. My personal copy is from 1948 and is one of my favorite treasures.	5
The story was good enough to keep you turning pages.  The reason I liked this book was the insight into the lonely world of nursing home patients that still have all their mental facilities.  It forced me to consider how senior generations (soon my parents, then myself) will deal with frailty, dignity & mortality.  Choices are thrust upon them by well meaning do-gooders.  Maybe we should allow seniors more slack to live the lives of THEIR choosing.  Either way, it aided me to see seniors with more compassion.	5
Water For Elephants, written by Sara Gruen, is a book told as a memoir by a fictional ninety-something old man about his time with the circus as a young man. This experience matured him and forever changed the direction of his life.This book is charming. I could relate to the characters and understand their motivations easily. I enjoyed reading it and have re-read it several times. I highly recommend it to everyone. (Should be at parents discretion as there are some adult themes. Probably best for those over thirteen.)	5
"When this book is telling the story of the circus, it is fascinating, describing a world that most readers know nothing about. But, possibly in an attempt to make it more ""commercial"", the author has chosen to focus on the love story, which is predictable. In those scenes, fascination turns to boredom.Use all that research (described in detail at the end of the book), Ms Gruen, to tell us more stories of the roustabouts, performers, animals and freaks of the circus - and forget the ""plot"" and the soap!"	5
After all the hype about this book, I finally gave in to reading a borrowed copy. I wanted to like it, truly I did.  I made it to page 164 with some effort.  The characters were not developed well enough for me to like them.  Also, I work with elderly people and the narrator as an elderly man was not altogether believable.What I did enjoy was learning a bit about the circus business  back in the 30s.Please if you know of some real 5-star novels, non-romance, let me know.	5
This is my second review on Amazon.  I seriously have a lot of catching up to do.I love books about animals as I am such an animal lover myself.  The read was cool, which hotted up at the end, although a little slow moving to begin with.  In the second half I couldn't put it down, I had to know the ending as I was on tender hooks all through the time.  I guess part of this story was very emotional.  Well worth a read despite the slow beginning.	5
I bought  A Companion Guide to Rome by Masson based on 5-star recommendations from Amazon, and for me it was not a worthwhile purchase.  The authors (it has been revised several times) offer infinite detail and historical tid bits, but it actually offers little that wasn't already in the Green Guide, and it is too heavy and too much reading in my opinion to do on site, while walking around. It was a nice reference, but I should have looked for it in the library and just borrowed it.	5
Martin's fifth book in this series is more of the same. It builds upon characters you think you know. There is an amazing amount of depth in this series and book five begins to reveal some of my favorite characters, especially Arya. It's not like every other fantasy out there where the good guys always win and the bad guys are the epitome of evil. It's real life, winners and losers, shades of good and evil.You'll find yourself loving, hating, loathing and pitying, and that's all on one character.Enjoy!	5
Not so much a sequel to Storm of Swords.  Provides narratives not found in the Storm of Swords in the same time period.  ex: Tyrion,  Arya, Daenerys  Actually...in hind sight, it was a great idea putting these in a book after the fourth as I seriously could have cared less about many of the characters featured in book 4.  Sansa?  Pfft.  Cercei? &#34;hey, i'm queen incestuous bitch.&#34;  Sam was mildly entertaining if it wasn't for his 24/7 bitching and moaning.  But Jon Snow, Arya, Tyrion, and Daenerys?  Hell yeah!	5
"This book grabs you from the minute you pick it up. It has intrigue, dysfunction, love, and amazing human-like emotions in the circus animals (from Rosie the elephant to Queenie the terrier).The movie was great, but the book had so much more depth and character-development.It seems so incredible that anything like this could happen in ""real life"", even during this period in US history. Tough circus life is described inamazing detail.The lopsided human love triangle adds another dimension to this book and its dysfunction. Would highly recommend this semi-fictional novel."	5
For the most part this was a moving and fascinating story. Well written, the characters were vivid and appealing, even, at times, the villains. However, I found the way the story ended to be somewhat trite and not at all believable.Although the loyalty and brotherhood among circus people was clearly portrayed throughout, the end of the story reduced this excellent portrait of a mysterious and esoteric world into a fairy-tale. For me, the lovely flight ended with a thud, from a delicious learning experience to an insult to my intelligence.	5
Loved it, loved it, loved it.  Gruen 'feels' what it must be like to retain a facile mind but be trapped in an aging body.  What do we have left?  Our memories--the 'pictures' we have made through life that are filed away in our memory banks.  Props to Gruen for her obvious deep research into the time period, especially what circus life was really like during the depression (and beyond).  Her characters are engaging and true to form, and she uses them to weave a wonderful tale.  A great read.	5
I finished this book as fast as I could. I felt the author was on another wavelength to the reader. I didn't care that the story was about this Georgie fellow. He seemed peripheral and the written perspective on him  oblique. The writing was good and I may try some other of the authors works  but the plot was feeble. Try Pat McCabe's breakfast on Pluto for energy and  a raw story or Ian McEwan's Amsterdam for a page turner with a plot of some  interest. Thumbs down for this one.	5
Loved every bit of this book. The narration is well-planned...we follow Jacob Jankowsi, a would-be vet with his father until his parents are killed in a car crash. Jacob hits the road, and one night jumps on a train. Little does he know that that one jump will change his life forever--for the better and the worst.Gruen delights readers with circus life during the depression, with strong character development and a strong plot. You root for the animals, who are heinously mistreated by the ringmaster, and you root for the workers.	5
I had high expectations for this, but it was kind of a chore to finish.  It was too depressing!  Too much brutality to the circus animals AND the circus humans, drunkenness, filth, squalor -- plus the portrait of life in the nursing home was grim.  When the narrator finally gets his true love, the author rushes through it in a few sentences and then goes back to the grimness.  I give her two stars because she's obviously done a lot of research on circuses, and I thought the photos were charming.	5
The various characters made this story interesting.  Each brought a part of every day life.  Some were misjudged.  I did not like the fact that one could not trust anyone well unless he/she were very well acquainted with each person.  the story was fascinating and circus life was presented as hard work, low pay, and no home for many.  I would recommend this book to imaginative spirits, and to those who trust and judge too easily and quickly.  There were some tender parts that were a relief from all the cheating.	5
After 132 previously written reviews I know there is not much new to say about this book. So, I will just say that I thoroughly enjoyed this book. Ms. Gruen states in the Author's note that she was going to write an entirely different book and instead wrote this one and I am so glad that she did. The research and old pictures make this a once upon a time story. The story is hypnotic and truly heartwarming from beginning to end. If looking for a great read, this is it.	5
If you were a kid and experienced the train arriving, the parade of elephants, and the setting up of the big tent, this book will inform you of what went on behind the extravaganza!  I saw the performers outside with their buckets, but who would ever imagine what their lives were like?  I went to the side shows, ate the cotton candy and this book brought it all back!  This is a great novel with circus history that I fully enjoyed!  A perfect ending to those who wonder about Jacob's future!	5
Dreadful.  Judging from the first paragraph, this novel had the potential for being absorbing and a good holiday read.  I was soon only making my way through it because I had nothing else to read and I kept thinking it must get better since it came highly recommended.  If only I had had something better than this time waster: lazy plot that never seemed to go anywhere because it went in too many irrelevant directions, little firsthand knowledge of the circus, low-level vocabulary.  A waste of time on a good topic.	5
While I find it a bit of a stretch to say this is part of the Jack Ryan story, it does provide the complete back story to one of the best characters in the Jack Ryan story line, Mr. Clark.  The story blends a human story with classic Clancy international politics and espionage better than any of his other works.  The read is enjoyable with multiple story lines running in parallel and converging with proper closer.  I miss the original cover art, but this is Clancy at his all around best.	5
This book was great; each chapter was a nugget of wisdom, resulting in a treasure trove by the end. It's no wonder this book is called a classic. Gibran uses a literary style inspired by the Bible, but it is still easy to read. Has a lot of philosophical ideas that I'm sure I will revisit in the future. Seems like one of those books that you learn something new every time you reread it. Definitely recommend, especially for anyone new to philosophy reading because it is short and easy to read.	5
I have been reading The Prophet every year for over a decade. Or intending to. It's an incredible read. If I'm having issues in my life, I read the section that relates to my problem and it helps clarify things somewhat. It is a divinely inspired piece of work, and can be read in one setting. There is pretty much nothing that he doesn't cover in the book that can't be related to your own life. I bought the ebook version so I could have easier access. It's a book for everyone.	5
Gibran wrote the ultimate way of seeing life and living in it. the importance of each relationship. The book was written to be relatable to every reader, all the subjects are mondain. The availability of this book is a great advantage that I don't think people are aware of. It's an hour long to read, but a lifetime to understand, if you read it you'll remember it in every new life matter or relationship.Buy it and keep it on the shelve for reference, it's an answer to everything. and read it carefully.	5
Love love love this book. This book is so much more than I thought it would be. Its beautiful, exciting, eye opening, and intriguing. I fell in love with the story and its characters from the beginning. Favorite character of all?... Rosie for sure... yes the elephant. Shes innocent, smart, witty, out smarts her humans and seemingly has a wonderful personality. She is amazing. But of course this book is not just about an elephant. Its about love, hate, excitement, tyranny, rage, and some real good laughs. Definitely a book worth reading.	5
I listened to the audiobook version of this book (great production!) but was one of those who was somewhat disappointed. I had read the glowing reviews and thought I'd give it a try. I listened to it all and thought the characters were wonderful but the plot was so slow. I felt like there were so many opportunities that the author had with the themes, time period, etc.that were not used. I give it three stars but there are so many other good books out there worth the 11 hours of time.	5
"I loved this book.  I could not put it down, because I was in such suspense about what would happen next.  I particularly love the storyline of the character as an old man in a nursing home - having worked in nursing homes, the descriptions are spot on.  I laughed out loud at his antics, and cried when characters I had grown to love were lost to tragedy.  I have never read a book where an elephant is a main character and pivotal to the story.  All I can say is ""WOW."""	5
What a pleasure to have such a fascinating book  read to me by two great readers! The main character, a 93 year old man recounting his life is read by an actor whose rough, gravelly voice perfectly embodies the character. The main character, as a 23 year old, is read by a much younger actor. Together, these two readers turned this book into an unforgettable novel.Maybe the book is every bit as good as a read, but having had heard it on CD, that's the way I'd recommend you discover it, too!	5
"I'm not picky about my books, really! I read airport books! I read mystery novels! But about half-way through, Water for Elephant's 2-dimensional, unrealistic characters' bad soap opera conversations became too tedious and repetitious.  I slogged through, anyway. I was waiting for more elephant plot. But no- Ms. Gruen got even lazier at the end.  Anything and anyone that might have been considered a loose end gets killed off without regret.  ""Mr. Major Character W? We threw him off the train 30 minutes ago. Probably(!!) died. Don't worry about it.""I was disappointed."	5
It is hard to find a book that can be described by these four words: Brutal, Moving, Honest and Surprising.  But Water for Elephants is just that novel.  It is not for the faint hearted, and the cruelty and squalor depicted rival some of the works of Dickens.  But also like Dickens there is a sheer honesty and redemption to be found, and as for the ending ... well I will not give anything away except to say that I did not see it coming.  An outstanding book by an outstanding writer.	5
This book is well written, well researched, and overall an interesting story. That said, without a doubt I would have closed it and never finished it due to the abuse of the animals, but I read until the end it because it was a book club choice. This is not a book for animal lovers and I found it to be incredibly painful. Those who torture animals are the scum of the earth in my opinion and I don't enjoy reading about them. Nothing personal Sara Gruen, you are a good writer.	5
A beautiful book. So wonderfully written that savoring the words was a joy, never mind the sensitive yet powerful story. Though the topics -- deafness, World War One -- suggest a very grim work, it ends up being a powerful affirmation of life.This book deserves to be much more widely known than it is; it's an excellent example of how even good books deserve ample promotion, as I think that it's a lot better than some major recent best-sellers. I was pleased to see in a bookstore recently that it's won an award.	5
This is simply just a wonderful book!The characters are well defined, each and everyone of them!  You care, you like, you love, you hate!The story unfolds with Jacob, at 91 or 93...he is not sure, and his life.Schooled in vetinary science, he finds himself adrift after the loss of his parents and any financial stability.  He joins the circus and meets a cast of characterS like no other.His love for Marlena, his ultimate choices and growth...the paths taken...andThen...he is 91 or 93...just read it...I can't wait to see the movie...it will be magic!	5

Holy cow! If George Martin had written the Wizard of oz Scarecrow would have been burned, the lion butchered, the tin man melted down for scrap and when Dorothy finally got home, Auntie Em would be dead on the floor.  BUT I love the story -certainly not predictable - intricate interwoven plot lines, fantastic and real characters --none perfect --some far too real --so real their deaths in the story left me grieving-- and rushing to download the next in the series---surely at least one of my Stark family will survive---Winter is here!	5
I used to love to read, however it has been ages since a book has captured me like this one did. The description of characters is both dear and terrible at times.  The description of the life with the circus in this time in history is fascinating. Not really for young readers, it is a bit lusty in some areas but not offensive to me. I have not experienced the movie yet, it will be a challenge to capture the quality of this  book.  I look forward to reading more of Sara Gruen novels.	5
"I enjoyed this book as evidenced by the fact that it only took me a few days to read.  The characters are engrossing and realistic.  It is amazing that Sara was able to write the part of an old man with such realism. When I read a book, I also like to learn well researched real facts. This book did not disappoint in that area. The history is interesting and accurate.  The end of the book is satisfying.  If you would like to ""get lost"" in a great book, this is a good choice."	5
I was curious.  I knew there was a movie based on the book.  I had never seen that movie as I thought it looked cheesy.  So I took a chance on the book and was not disappointed!What a view into the circus culture!  Things the customers don't see and would never expect!  I've been dying to see the movie since and can't find it in Redbox and none of my friends own it.  And it's not On Demand!  I will see it at some point though.  I think now it will be worth it.	5
I loved this book.  It was breath-taking alive - as if I could smell it, taste it and feel it.  It was like I became lost in the Great Depression era.  I so wanted it to end so that I could hear the conclusion of Jacob's life with the circus, but I didn't want it to end because it was such an enjoyable book.  I liked the way the story was narrated by Jacob as a young man and as an old man.  It is hard to believe that this was not an autobiography.	5
I've seen the book from time to time, but the cover never intrigued me enough to actually buy and read it. Now I wish I had picked it up the first time I saw it! It is a delightfully different story of a 93 year old man who tells his story of his years in the circus through flashbacks. The topics are obviously well researched and that adds something special to the novel. It is a very engaging read and I would recommend it for anyone looking for a lighter, different type of book.	5
I had not read Sara Gruen's work when my book club decided to read Water for Elephants...now I am a big fan! The writing is clear and engaging, the story is filled with vivid characters (including Rosie the elephant), and the action is well paced. Gruen seamlessly interweaves the story of an aging ex-circus vet and his recollections of the exciting (and often dangerous) road show days. With her interesting research into the carny heyday, Gruen transports the reader into another world, including the fascinating vocabulary of the performers and roughnecks. A lovely story!	5
From the dust jacket: ...Red Adam's Lady is a boisterous, bawdy tale of wild adventure, set against the constant dangers of medieval England. It is a story of civil war and border raids, scheming aristocrats and brawling villagers, daring escapes...Its vivid details give the reader a fascinating and realistic view of life in a medieval castle and village...The reviews here are excellent. There are times when I cringe at the brutality of an era but the writing here is so fast-paced I found I didn't have time. It's a wild ride and highly enjoyable.	5
This book is based on an excellent idea that is mostly followed through on. However, it's difficult to like any of the characters. Their mental stability, social standings and interactions and sex lives are studied tediously over and over. Without some of the nonsense this could have been a thoroughly enjoyable book of half the length and I would not have had to skip pages and pages to finish it. By the way - the skipping of long detailed explanations of individual views of the society did not cause a rift in the story.	5
I've read most all of Mr. Clancy's novels and John Clark is probably my favorite character in all of his books. This novel explains Clark's whole existence in a very real and believable way so any reader that picks up a Jack Ryan or Rainbow Six Novel will be well informed not only about Mr. Clark but several other main characters in a lot of other novels as well without having to scratch there heads trying to figure out where these particular people come from. Plus it's a great standalone novel all by itself.	5
"As he (the ""prophet"") awaits the ship that will return him to his home country after fourteen years of being absent, he begins providing answers in colorful parables to questions raised by the occupants of the city he has temporarily made his home.  We follow this spiritual man as the loving townspeople seek him out for wisdom.  There is ultimately great sadness when he departs.I would describe these writings as poetic, philosophic prose for daily spiritual living.  There are many sound words, with a relaxed style, and a somewhat universalistic belief.  It is okay.Lord's blessingsScott"	5
I am very interested in the time period of this story and setting. I am refreshed by their hard times, their often cruel lives and how they could even make it from day to day. There was one moment early in the book, I almost laid it down and didn't pick it up for it was so oppressive to me. I am an avid animal lover so I felt a double punch to the gut. Yes, I cried. Overall, it was a journey, through hard times...but you know what? They made it, and will continue.	5
I normally don't select bestsellers for reading pleasure; they so often disappoint. Had my book club not selected this for discussion I probably would not have read it. But I am so glad I did. The book is well writen, not just a good story, but excellent writer's craft. Any person over fifty with any empathy at all will identify with the story teller. Younger people will identify with the main characters in the circus story. I am not particularly interested in circus history, but this was fascinating. The ending is especially wonderful...fanciful but wonderful.	5
This books was one of my favorites for the year. This book flashes from present day Jacob, 93 living in a nursing home to Jacob's summer traveling with the circus during the 1930's Depression era. Not only do you have these rich circus characters and animals, but also you have the interesting time period. The writing is flawless, the characters/animals (Rosie, my favorite) are amazing, the plot keeps you interested, and you root for the Jacob in the past and his present condition.The slight twist in the whodunit revealed near the end was also suprising	5
Given the number and quality of this book's other reviews on this site, I'll keep my comments short.  When a reader has a book that contains an otherwise unfamiliar setting made familiar though amazingly extensive detail, fully developed characters, a strong storyline, and subtly woven literary themes, they have a great book.  Water for Elephants is such a book.  Gruen's novel is proof that the combination of exhaustive research and solid writing makes an unforgettably stunning book.  This is one instance where the number of positive reviews don't lie:  Water for Elephants is worth reading.	5
Our Kindle Book Club gave this book 7 out of 10.  I liked the way Gruen brought a life together and illustrated the ways we gain respect and lose respect.  The history of the Circus life was based on fact, it showed the degree of cruelty toward animals and humans in the desire to make money. There was also a degree of cruelty and lack of respect in the Nursing Home. The love story was nicely developed without becoming the main story.  We loved Jacob he was a good man.  The ending was brilliant, he won!	5
I give this book a 2.6.  All those people Jacob's father helped in that little town and no one came forward in his time of tragedy?  It just didn't seem realistic to me.  Someone from immigrant stock with the pluck and drive to get into Cornell vet school is not likely to founder in this situation, nor just dismissively to walk away from his final exams.  Jacob wasn't a pampered trust fund baby; he'd probaby had it a bit rough all along. The rest of the story is just a contrivance built upon an unbelievable premise.	5
It is only March and I have already voted this book for my Book of the Year Award, which I normally select toward the end of the year.  This book was beautifully written.  You could see the human emotions coming through the characters and it made me want to keep turning the pages to see what was going to happen.  You feel both sorrow and joy in the characters.  Frances Itani knows the human heart and displays it so well on paper.  Great job!  I am going to make this book a part of my permanent library.	5
A very unusual book. I couldn't put it down. It gives an insight to circus life in the days when they travelled by train. It is written through the eyes of a young lad who traumatised by the death of his parents was unable to complete his final exam to become a vet and accidentally joins the circus. The characters and the animals are all very real. Some you love and some you hate (never the animals. Anyone who loves circuses and remembers (or would like to know) how they used to be will love this book.	5
The book was weird. I felt like I was reading a porn book or something. The description on how the female dances, it goes all into details even how she touches her boobs she even goes naked. I don't get it is she a a circus whore? I didn't want to read a book on how she touches herself... so im returning,Im not into that kinda of reads. Maybe it is not like that as in whole book? but its an early start for dirty things so I assume the rest of the book is the same.	5
Without a doubt, IMHO, this book has got to be one of the best ever done on the last book of the Bible and how those thing written there relate to other prophetic books of the Bible (Especially the book of Daniel) and history. It is beautifully written and has many detailed charts and pictures. What is really cool is to realize this book was done in the early 1900's, before The Jewish people went back home and reclaimed the land God promised them. I loved this book and it confirmed the truth found within the Bible. RMS	5
Water for Elephants draws you in from the very beginning. The story is fast paced and details circus life during the Depression years, making the reader see that for many, the circus was a way to keep food in one's stomach, when others had no jobs and were going hungry.Gruen does a good job of detailing the factual side of operating and working a circus, while keeping the story engaging. The only minor problem is that characterization is a bit weak, especially regarding Jacob, the main character.The book contains photos from circus archives, which is a nice touch.	5
I finally got around to reading Water for Elephants, it's been on my Kindle forever. I was interested in seeing the movie, but didn't want to until I read the book.It was good, especially the end. At times I wanted to finish just to move on to my next book, but at the end of I was hooked on seeing what would happen next. For some reason, I didn't get what all the craze was about though. Probably because I read a lot of really excellent books this year, including another circus book that blew this one away.	5
This audiobook was so well done! Two different readers provide for the voices of the man at 93, living in a rest home and his 23 year old self in memory. Alternate chapters keep the reader torn between hearing the story of Jacob and his experiences with a circus during the depression and his later self coping with another type of depression as he deals with a worn out body and his limited life as he waits to die. Anyone with compassion for older people will find this story heart wrenching and enlightening at the same time. Excellent!	5
For Whom the Bell Tolls is a fantastic book.  Hemingway writes heroes with fears, doubts, and faults so well that I feel a deep connection with them.  Not every man is a John Wayne; passing through life clear of purpose and without second thoughts.  (But watch a little tv and you'd think it were so.)  Hemingway creates characters I can understand, appreciate, and connect with.  Also, Robert Jordan's love interest reflected my own with my fiancee.  The book was fantastic for its story, its plot, the characters and the way it made me feel reading it and afterwards.	5
Although the Jack Ryan fans are used to the books building on one another, this one features a side character. This book can be read by anyone who feels that books just can't do it for them. I have lent this book to three or four others, and the ones who actually read it loved it! It's a great book!You do not have to know about Clancy's previous books to enjoy this one; that alone makes it a good selection in some cases. I would think that this book would be enjoyed by anyone who likes action movies.	5
"I was born in 1920.  I grew up during the Great Depression and the Prohibition eras.In 1965 we owned a bait and tackle shop in Venice, Florida.  At that time the Ringling Bros. Circus wintered there and we became acquainted with many circus people.  Our shop was a hangout for them and every evening after rehearsals they would stop by for a beer.The book: ""Water for Elephants"" is extremely well written and I am planning to read more of Sara Gruen's work.I have ordered two more copies and given them to friends.  They have given me very good reports."	5
A pleasant, quick read.  The circus details were nicely researched and its full of colorful characters.  I did, however, find the alternating time periods intrusive, and the plot sadly predictable.  I also wish the villain had been more complex -- although the author provides us with mental illness as an excuse, it seemed too convenient, and frankly, not quite clinically credible. A sweet ending, although perhaps a bit sentimental. All in all, not an original book, nor one that will stand the test of time, in my opinion, however, for all that, an agreeable way to spend the afternoon.	5
Water for elephants was certainly an entertaining read, but I have  read better. It did help to open my eyes to the life of circus performers in the 1920's. This was very well projected throughout the entire book, and it was easy to tell that the author was very well educated on the topic. I do think however that there should be a warning about the sexual content within the book. I would only recommend it for mature readers. I would recommend this book if you have a lot of time to enjoy the context in which it was written.	5
"I just finished ""Water for Elephants"" the day before yesterday!  I can't seem to find anything I want to read now as that story just won't go away.  It was far and beyond one of my favorite books.  I just loved it!  Once I started it, I couldn't put it down.  Now I want to see more pictures of the old circuses.  Amazing what she was able to capture with her words and that she could understand what an old man could be feeling and thinking.  I love it when I can find a book like hers.  I highly recommend it!"	5
"Water for Elephants is told through the ""90 something"" year old man in a retirement as he relives his life which came back to him when the circus comes to town.  The main character goes through some tough times and finds himself working for the circus a world he knows nothing about.  He then falls for a girl who is about as off limits as she can be.  This book is a very entertaining book that may start off a bit slow but once it picks up you can't stop reading until it's all over.  Fantastic book for a summer read!"	5
I wanted to read the book before I saw the movie and was greatly surprised that I enjoyed it so much.  It is a story filled with such sad moments but also the promise of a happy future.  It is told in a wonderful way.  I enjoyed the whole ride from beginning to end.  There was some moments when I just wanted him to leave the damn circus already but do what exactly?  or go work where?  you realize how bad the economy was and at least here he was eating every day which might not have been the case anywhere else.	5
This book took me by surprise.  It seemed to drag a bit through the first few chapters, but then it got very interesting very quickly.  I was not a fan of the bad language, but the author really tries to put the reader in the rough circus setting and unfortunately, the circus is composed of less-than-polished people.  This book is full of action, and has a great romance story.  I loved the ending.  Minus the language and crudeness, I would give this book 5 out of 5.PS (I'VE HEARD THAT ROBERT PATTINSON WILL BE PLAYING JACOB JANKOWSKI IN THE MOVIE IN 2011!)	5
Water for Elephants is a small step up from chick-lit, which isn't necessarily a bad thing, if it's what you're looking for.  A great read for the beach, or a good light read in-bewteen heavier or darker novels.As mentioned in other reviews, the character development was on the poor side, and the plot was pretty predictable (kind of hokey).  I felt the reading level was quite low, which made it a quick read, but not the brightest one.  Everything was pretty spoon-fed to the reader...there was no need for me to think about anything.  I prefer a bit more of a challenge.	5
The book is large (10.5x14.5) and is fully illustrated and worth every penny. The illustrations are not step-by-step but are large images that show the finished product. I learned more from studying the final dish images in large format than from all the other Mexican cook books I have, and I have more cookbooks than I need. The recipes cover the simplest to the more complicated. I like the simpler ones. I have many of the best books from other authors, but they are text, text, text. This one makes me want to cook, which I am going to do right now!	5
Red Mars does have a plot - several actually - but the action meanders along in an almost dreamlike way.  Robinson spends pages getting his characters from point a to point b with little forward movement of any storyline.On the other hand, there is a major gap of years in the book's plot, and Robinson conveniently invents a reason for his suddenly much older characters to continue being vital.  Granted, such inventions are de rigeur in Sci-Fi.Nevertheless, the book is well-researched and well-written, making it a pleasure to read, even if I'm reading about driving through a canyon for the hundredth time.	5
Along with the Miracle Life of Edgar Mint, The Secret Life of Bee's, and Kite Runner; this is one of my favorite books.  I read it, gave it to my husband (who rarely reads a book)- he finished it in a week, and my 15 year old daughter - who finished it in a day.  We all really enjoyed it!  The way the author describes life in an old-folks home is hilarious and heartbreaking at the same time.  Even though it started with the end, we all found the book kept us wondering what would happen next!  Especially good for a book club!	5
I adored Water For Elephants when I read it the first time, but it was on my second reading that I realized the extreme skill Gruen exhibits on every page and in every scene. Her prose is crisp and exacting, and her characters are so vivid, they leap to life in this story that grabs hold of you and  doesn't let go. I was literally transported to another place in time. I can't recommend Water For Elephants highly enough. This book deserves all the praise it's received and then some. What a beautiful novel--a treasure for all who curl up with this gem!	5
I loved this book! Honestly the only reason I picked it up was because of the movie with Robert Pattinson (yes, I know...I rarely justify the reading of a book with an actor).  I really enjoyed the time setting for this book and the behind the scenes look at the life of a circus worker back then.  I also liked how the entire book wasn't just a love story and how nicely it was framed within the overall novel.  This is definitely a book that I would recommend and read again! And just as a side note, the move was awesome as well!	5
For Whom the Bell Tolls takes the reader on a three and a half day journey starring Robert Jordan who is assigned with blowing up a bridge. He is in Spain and the fighting is between fascists and the Republicans (Robert Jordan&#8217;s side). It accounts his time with a group of guerrilla fighters.While the writing drags on at times and in the beginning it is difficult to tell what or whom the dialogue is between, it is a pretty good book. Topics such as love &#8211; between Maria and Jordan, the psychology of soldiers, and who God is are covered in this book.	5
The whole Patrick O'Brian are works of art and will grab you for Captain Aubrey's entire career.  Interesting to note how many obstacles he overcomes as he climbs the ladder of command in the Royal Navy.  Its a good primer for young folks starting a career; it is not always a rocket path to the top.  You will encounter traditions, rules, and technology that impede your goals; and one has to be a risk taker.  Again and again Aubrey takes risks, rallies his seamen, and prevails.  One wonders if a personality like Aubrey would be tolerated in our risk aversion US Navy today.	5
This is a great great Heavy Rock album from the legendary SLASH!!!! I really like the Slash years on GUNS N ROSES, and this one APOCALYPTIC LOVE is like a modern HEAVY inspired version of what GUNS should be today....The singer Myles is GREAT!!!! His vocals reminds A LOT axl vocals, but that's actually a cool thing!!! Man, this album is GREAT!!!! TOTALLY RECOMMENDED!!!!!! WELL DONE, SLASH!!!!!	6
"If you want to watch Scooby Doo with your children, try ""Scooby-Doo and the Alien Invaders"", ""Scooby-Doo and the Monster of Mexico"", ""Scooby-Doo and the Loch Ness Monster"", ""Scooby-Doo and the Cyber Chase"" or ""Scooby-Doo and the Ghoul School"".This is far too dark, and scary, for most young children, or even older children.I adore this movie now that I am a teenager, though. It's great for older Scooby Doo fans."	6
I've seen Bessmertmova's Giselle on this video and on stage, simply disapointing. Since she was Bolshoi's former director Grigorovich's wife, it's easy to understand why she was the Bolshoi's ultimate Giselle and Odette, there were so many dancer's much better than this one,(Maximova, Kolpakova,Osipenko). Besmertnova has no technique, and artistically she's always herself,sad and melancholic,(and don't miss her unproportioned,huge hands!makes her port-de-bras always out of line, wrist-cracked). My favorite one? Alessandra Ferri,she's superb!	6
Quite possibly the best all-around entertainer to ever step on a stage! Bobby was head-and-shoulders above his contemporaries... and others. Darin DARED! He recorded material (Dr. Doolittle; Milord, included here and, en francais, no less!) others would not even attempt and more often than not was successful, artistically if not necessarily commercially.This 4CD package represents a great cross-section of his work.A superb talent, great material, a superb package from Rhino! Superb entertainment in store for you!	6
"Just bought a copy of this incredible album released by the legendary canadian power trio RUSH. It was with great pleasure that I saw our Brazilian edition bringing the lyrics and a very good artwork (the same as the imported CD's). About the band, these guys are playing better and better, year after year. Solid Rock and Roll, as usual. My favourite track? # 9 ""Headlong Flight"". Same style as ""Snakes And Arrows"", which, for me, is more than enough."	6
Simply, one of the top prog records of all time.  Hard to get into at first, but every listen penetrates your soul until you get fully addicted to one of the most gifted and original rocK groups of all time.  Specially  interesting to guitarrists, bassists and drummers. This line up can hardly  be any better in creativity and chops. Also recommended: Red, Starless and  Bible Black, and Discipline studio Cd's.  There is also a recent wonderful  live compilation called Cirkus.	6
"I ordered this back in 1987 and waited a while to get it...this is what a AC/DC show is all about...it's funny seeing Angus totally stoned during some of the interviews...good concert..to bad you can't get the footage from the apollo theater when they were on tour back in 1978... ""riff raff"" shows up in the family jewels collection..that would be worth buying..in all very good concert....though Who made Who and Blow up your Video  concert tours were far better......"	6
This is Disney's all-time best animated film!! You'll never forget new-born Bambi with his big eyes, discovering the world around him with the help of his friend, Thumper.  Bambi loses his mother in a heartbreaking scene that is very intense and unforgettable.  He grows up and becomes the new King of the forest.  There are beautiful songs and cute creatures to enjoy.  Bambi is my favorite Disney movie...sad, funny, and magical; this is the Circle of Life told at its best.	6
Thoroughly mindblowingly brilliant, as in almost all things the Fab Four did.  Five stars if only for the performance of &quot;I Am the Walrus&quot;  (&quot;No You're Not!&quot; Said Little Nicola) and the off-kilter  eccentricities of the Men of the Century (Liverpool edition).  Play LOUD  and take with lots and lots of tea.  And biscuits.It'll all make  perfect sense, if you are ready and willing.  Otherwise, better not to  worry about it.God bless the Beatles and all those who sail with them.	6
"This was my first time seeing anying by the Australian Ballet and I was very impressed.  Costumes and sets are beautiful.  Pavane and Horsman are very talented performers.  I really enjoyed the second act in the Dr's ""workroom"".  The members of the company who ""dance"" the various ""dolls"" are great especially the one who performs the floppy, unformed, unsculpted ""doll"".  Also worth noting is that a friend who knows nothing about ballet easily understood the story without help from me or any other source."	6
In honor of today being Christmas Eve, I thought I'd review this movie. This is another childhood favorite. Mary Kate and Ashley Olsen star as Sarah & Julie Thompson who are always getting into trouble. When they overhear their mother crying, they decide to give her a break and head off to Grandma Mimi's house for Christmas. Along the way, they meet Eddie, who is in love with their mother, and they are kidnapped by bandits. I highly recommend TO GRANDMOTHER'S HOUSE WE GO!!!	6
This is an intimate look at Pearl Jam rehearsing and recording they're incredible &quot;Yield&quot; album.  The DVD does not contain chapters or extras, which I'll admit is kind of a drag.  You have to start it at the  beginning and just watch it.  But upon watching it, you find Pearl Jam  lightening up and making music with smiles on their faces as they perform.  It's a great film which inspires me, as a musician, to play and write  better and love what I do.	6
If your kids love classic animated movies, without any computer effects, and too many intense scenes, then buy 'Charlotte's Web'!Debbie Reynolds are the charming and wise spider Charlotte, that saves the young pig Wilbur's life, Wilbur is perfectly voiced by Henry Gibson, all the songs gives the kids many lessons, just like all the songs in 'Land Before Time' do, the animation is not getting up beside Disney, but if you like old fashioned cartoons, 'Charlotte's Web' is a must have for all ages!	6
This is absolutely the best concert film of this band, and it is screaming for a remastering/sound touch-up. I went to alot of concerts in my younger days, and this video makes me nostalgic for that time, when a band just plugged in and ROCKED.  Let's get this on a nice 5.1 surround DVD!  If you like AC/DC, you have to find this. I bought mine at one of the locals thst still had a few video tapes for 5.99!  Glad I grabbed it.	6
Dude this band is awesome. I saw these guys in concert and they are AWESOME. They put on a really good show. That's where I really got to hear them and I've loved them since. What attracted me the most is that the lead singer, a girl, what screaming. I've never heard a female do screamo. It's freakin' awesome. And her voice is so unique. I love it. I highly recommend this CD AND I recommend going to see them in concert because they rock!	6
A magic concert that needs to be seen by all, not just S&G; fans.  If you already own the album of this, then buy it as an accompanying piece.Thankfully the Australian DVD has been given a 5.1 surround sound mix as well.  But it is important to note that it is only simulated which means it is a pseudo surround sound.  Obviously the concert was originally only recorded in 2 channel stereo.  In 1981, that may have been the only option.A long awaited DVD anyway!	6
If you're a huge Aerosmith fan or like learning about great rock bands then I highly recommend this DVD!  Aerosmith is my favorite band of all time.  This DVD has 2 sides.  I loved learning about how much time goes into making an album and how they come up with songs.  I'll definitely be buying other Aerosmith DVD's and learning more about them since they haven't been on Vh1's Behind The Music in forever.  I highly recommend buying this.  It's definitely worth your time and money.	6
"...but fans won't be punished with this purchase.  Good, solid album.  Has that complex ""evolved"" Rush sound that the band has developed over the last few years.  If you've been catching the last few Rush video programs on cable, DVD, or Blu-Ray you'll know what I mean.  (Think of the ""Far Cry"" live performances.)  It's wonderful, thought-provoking music to which you'll want to listen again, to pick up what you missed the first time.Recommended for all Rush fans: young, old, and to-be.  Delay yourselves no longer."	6
"Performance art, pure and simple, as William Shatner juxtaposes poetry with pop lyrics in this 1968 release.Shatner's wry sense of humor is concealed in his presentation; spoken word with dramatic pauses, which punctuates with an exclamation point - or three - his theatre of the absurd. A parody on the pop culture of the day, it transforms ""The Captain"" into a vocalist with wit and a laugh.....seemingly a bad combination for someone who is supposed to be cruising the galaxy with a Vulcan, Scotty and Bones."	6
"This is gonna be a short and sweet review, so...Maiden England is Iron Maiden's England gig duirng ""Seventh Son of a Seventh Tour"" in 1989. I downloaded Maiden England via Ares.ME is one of their best, IMO. It starts with Moonchild, and ends with Iron Maiden. I'm even surprised they performed ""Killers""! The stage theme is an Iceberg. You gotta love the slideshow at the beginning, and Bruce's ""Teddy Bear"" thing on stage before ""Infinite Dreams""!This is a must-have for any maiden fan. Up the irons!"	6
I have to admit it.  I didn't care for it much at all - and I am a pretty big Rush geek.  But I kept listening and found that it has grown on me.  I still think Geddy's singing is a bit stretched at times, and I would have enjoyed more solos from Alex.  But overall its a very, very solid concept album and I am very glad they went this route on this album.  Great story, great music, and a nice change of pace.Great work guys!	6
Don't get me wrong - I love the Beatles more than anyone. My comments are more about the DVD than the movie itself (which is still pretty bad, but, they were wasted). The company who made this DVD did a terrible job. The  video is &quot;dirty&quot; and full of &quot;short hairs.&quot; It looks  worse than a VHS tape played 100 times. Don't make this your first Beatles  video purchase; make it your last. And don't knock me because I think it  sucks - I'm telling the truth.	6
The Floyd playing ECHOES part I in the sun-splashed arena by day as the camera tracks in slowly(awesome).Waters pounding the heck out of the gong on Saucerful of Secrets, slow motion sequences during One of These Days,  strangely lit scene during Set the Controls &amp; Wright's keyboarding,and  the making of Dark Side with interviews.Need I say more, this is the  definitive Floyd VHS.Non-Floyd fans don't even knock this one because if  you don't appreciate the Floyd then you won't like this anymore than you  would The Wall.	6
Being in America, seeing OASIS {The best band in the world} live is a rare treat.  However after I bought this one, I can see them live whenever I want.  This is rock and roll at its best, and Oasis know how to put on a show. This DVD does not have any special features on it.  That is its only flaw. I wish FAMILURE TO MILLIONS would come to DVD cos, I want to hear the new songs and see it LIVE.. OASIS RULES&gt;&gt; I LOVE OASIS	6
This is the very best live concert video by AC/DC capturing the band at their peak and featuring the legendary Bon Scott.  I first saw this film on VHS back in the early 80s.  When the DVD format came out, I assumed that this would be one of the first live concerts issued.  But it took >10 years - I have no idea why.  Better late than never.  The video looks great; the audio is less than perfect, but good enough.  It's my favorite AC/DC video by far.	6
"This is by far the best collection of Devo videos, bar none.  It blows the DVD ""Devo - The Complete Truth About De-Evolution"" completely away.  This video compilation has great segue sequences between each music video that creates a really entertaining production.  There are vignettes in here that you can't find in other collections of Devo vids - appearances by Booji Boy and many other great Devo characters.  I don't understand why this VHS tape hasn't simply been re-issued in DVD format.  I'd buy it in a heartbeat."	6
Bambi (Two-Disc Diamond Edition Blu-ray/DVD Combo in Blu-ray Packaging) is a classic Disney movie that has one of the most sad moments of their movies, i.e., the death of Bambi's mother. The animation is amazing and it truly is one of the Disney's classic movies. Right up there with other amazing animated movies such as Snowwhite, Cinderella and Dumbo. The storyline is well-develped as well as the characters. This is a movie that will be enjoyed by children as well as adults for generations to come. Highly recommended. 5/5.	6
Probably the greatest commercial animated film done by Walt Disney's amazing crew of animators in the &#34;glory&#34; years.  It is an amazing piece of work.  Some of the material the studio did for the military during WWII might rival it for animation prowess, but not for sheer storytelling on the commercial level.  It is simply great.  It was Walt's favorite and he agonized over Bambi's mom.  This is one they sure as hell don't make anymore.  I wonder how it would look if Pixar took a crack at it?	6
I can agree with the other reviews: this video, which is titled to be an Elmo one, does NOT have much Elmo in it. This left my daughter asking for the furry red monster throughout the video. Elmo makes cameo appearances, popping in here and there for a minute or two. The rest of the video is full of fun songs (we love the Mighty Mighty Bosstones one) but not enough character interaction. A little disappointing, but older kids and adults will really appreciate the songs and guest appearances.	6
"Fritz Lang's first sound film is a masterpiece of dread and suspense. Hans appears almost like the children he victimizes, soft and weak, and his fear of exposure almost makes us pity him. You can't conceive of anyone but Lorre pulling off this tricky characterization.  Lang creates a Berlin whose layout seems designed to expose the molester, a city of shadows, blind alleys, and a million unseen, unsparing eyes. Seventy five years after its release, this film retains its shock value. Along with ""Metropolis"", an early pinnacle for director Lang."	6
I first saw Brian Regan on Comedy Central talking about simple things like IHOP and trifocals...absolutely hilarious. This is a very funny disk...especially the name and spelling bee bits. I really like this guy because he doesn't curse and he isn't dirty at all. Comedians these days think they have to be vulgar to be funny. In my opinion, vulgarity isn't funny at all; Profanity in comedy has been rubbed into the ground. It's annoying and a sign of a lack of creativity. Brian Regan is clean, ingenious and hilarious.	6
The only reason I would rate this down a star is that I'm disappointed in the 5.1 mix (should say 3.1) as there's absolutely nothing coming from the rear speakers.  The sound is quite good for what's there & the picture is AMAZING, great HD transfer there.  The sound should be much more powerful considering the band involved, but have been waiting for this on DVD for eight years so not complaining too much.  Really pleased to see this old Bon footage finally put out in this format.  Da' Wolf	6
This is Pink Floyd at it's best. This is some of their best music available. The only problem is the tacky shots of the band replaying some of the music in the studio in front of a blue screen. These shots are  totally out of place with the pompeii footage. The music however, redeems  this minor flaw. Particularly impressive is when David Gilmour sits down in  the dirt and messes with a metal bar and a delay peddle and when Roger  Waters is beating the hell out of the gong.	6
The Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles were the cartoon craze I remember growing up.  I was so happy someone finally put the movie on DVD.  While this movie wasn't great as far as technical standards it still did a great job capturing the story line and personalities.  I thought maybe I had outgrown the turtles but as soon as I saw the movie again I was hooked.  I couldn't wait to find an original Nintendo and start playing the TMNT game again.  You've got to own this part of independent film history.	6
First of all, i'm glad to see that i'm not the only not-kid (i'm 19) that still loves this movie and that cried when seeing it again...It's a great movie to see when you are a child, and a great movie to see through your life, until you could watch it with your own children.It's also an important movie: A friend of mine had a history teacher that said that this movie shows greatly the lives of the immigrants to America, so you'll also get a bit of history with it.	6
This is a Disney oldie but goodie, with lots of stuff that should keep just about anyone entertained. My parents enjoyed this when it came out, and I enjoyed it many years later. I have to admit that I am especially fond of Captain Hook, and all of the characters and storyline in this film were well-done. Some people will like this more than others - depending on personal tastes - but overall this is a great Disney classic and if you're a Disney fan, you'll want to check this out!	6
Arguably the better of the two DVD's available for James Taylor, &quot;Live at Beaconsfield&quot; is an impressive showcase of JT's career. It has a high re-watch factor, and both soundtracks (PCM or 5.1) are worth a listen.  If you have a good surround sound system, you will honestly feel like you are there.  It's that good!There are over 20 songs to watch and listen, which make it worth every penny.  A music DVD that is a must in your collection.  Add the impressive picture sharpness, and you have a real winner.	6
After reading some of the other reviews I really don't have much more to add.  However in my opinion it's as good as the other's have said and then some.  I own three of these 3G concert versions, and this is my favorite because of the jam at the end with all three.  It's too bad they didn't make that a tridition with all three, but the other two are damn good and well worth purchasing on their own merit....A good collection to own if you're in to exteremly hot guitar licks....	6
I'm another long-time Rush fan who found Clockwork Angels to be completely disappointing.  I think the production of this CD left Geddy's vocals sounding completely flat and distant, like he's on a hill 100 feet away from the rest of the band while recording is going on, and without his dynamic voice giving life to the lyrics, and everything else being mashed together, to me it's just one continuous boring bit of overly loud overly processed noise.  If you want to hear the real Rush, buy anything else they've released but this.	6
my man, Norman, turned me on to the Dead. we have this movie and it is sooooo cool! if you are a fan, you must have it!Jerry produced this and made it, hired cameramen etc. and did it. shows back stage stuff, set up, the concerts, the hippies and fans in the crowd. experience a Dead concert - watch this movie - 'cause you sure can't go see the Dead in concert like this anymore. (Jerry is gone, sniff)a real cool experience - for sure. Dead-heads - buy it. curious? buy it.	6
For an opera film in 1968, this is a vivid performance, both artistically and techno-electronically.  This film is all about Anna, with a supporting cast which is more than adequate.  How can any red blooded male, or even female, not fall in love or at least sympathize with this Violetta?  The lips are mumbling, but voluminous music spew out of those lungs.  This shortcoming is easily forgiven.  I don't mind the lip-synch, given the beautiful music extolled by the performers.  The bottom line about this film:  Anna Moffo is Anna Moffo !!	6
The film is old, and the cinematography dated; however, we are fortunate to have such a vibrant Violetta. Without such films, we become jaded by the stylized, and often leaden, performances of today. We also need a sense of history. This film gives us a point of departure from which we can understand other interpretations of the opera. Anna Moffo is clearly a more believable Violetta than we are likely to find today. Her looks are distinctive, fitting with the character, not like the emotionally barren performances of most sopranos these days.	6
This is one of the best collections of his videos.  Wish it had been reissued on a one side disc and for HDTV. I gave it only 3*s because it is a great collection but does not look great on HDTV.  I originally bought this years ago for my granddaughter.  Have now bought it again for myself.  Have been following Michael since the beginning and was so looking forward to his successful return.  Michael Jackson was truly a giant in the music industry and The King of Pop is a title he has earned.	6
Their are several excellent songs on this album! Myles Kennedy is coming into his own as a vocalist and Slash is still an awesome guitar player. He is experimental enough that you don't feel he is afraid of playing something new or different and yet at the same time he keeps the riffs flowing throughout the album! For me Your a Lie and Bad Rain are highlights but there are several others that rock and very few that do not! A very succesful effort that brings Slash out of the immense shadow of GnR!!	6
Our 4-year old enjoyed it, with a little explanation in order about Miss Clavel's habit, and about the motives of the kidnappers.A very nice extra on the DVD is an old 1952 animated short based closely on the original Bemelmans book, with the text and cartoon style nearly identical. Amusingly, Miss Clavel is therein depicted as a sort of governess, rather than as a nun; perhaps a sign of the times, or maybe the cartoon's producers were not Catholic?I thought Hatty Jones did great in the title role -- wonder what ever happened to her?	6
"I was shocked to see Tchaikovsky's classic danced exclusively by males.  One reviewer felt that the result was a ""human""-- not merely  ""romantic""-- ballet.  I saw it as a travesty of Swan Lake.  We all know that gays have contributed much to ballet, but Nureyev danced with Fonteyn in the pas de deux from Le Corsaire.  A gay agenda should not trump artistic integrity.  The superb pas de deux by Yulia Makhalina and Igor Zelensky in the other selection from Swan Lake did not remove the bad taste left by Adam Cooper and Scott Ambler."	6
"This is the film we all will someday show our kids and hopefully inculcate many morals to live by:  ""Now, children, remember, life isn't always fair. Don't start forest fires, and tell all your hunter friends that Bambi misses his mommy.""I liked the film. I really did. My mother...well, she's a mother, so she understands the ""sacrifices"" (I've never seen anyone so passionately cry for Dumbo's mother, either).It's a Disney classic, so if you plan to have kids someday, and you want to get the above messages across, this movie pretty much does the trick."	6
Classic Disney movie on Blu-Ray, though not without a few reservations. There are screenshot threads comparing the blu-ray with the VHS and I feel that this bluray is a worthy upgrade without too many awful mistakes like on the Cindarella blu-ray or others like Little Mermaid (has been recalled), Robin Hood, and Sword in the Stone.  Luckily it wasn't edited or changed to make it any less-racist, so it's still the Peter Pan you remember :-)  But the transfer is a huge step up from the awful DVD that was released a few years back.	6
This is a great movie.  I've seen it a ton of times.  And it was amazing how many people showed up to this invent.  I am a big fan of Jimi Hendrix and I loved his version of the Star Spangled Banner.  I liked the Who's performance.  And Richie Havens singing Freedom.  Also Sly and the Family Stone singing I Wanna Take You Higher and Sly doing a little dance.  And Country Joe and the Fish singing that song about the war.  The whole movie is great.  Anybody that hasn't seen it should see it.	6
"Love it! I ordered it monday evening, and received it on saturday. The only thing I didnt like was when i selected ""play all videos"", for some reason it didnt play Valentine Girl. It was like it wasnt even on the dvd. It just skipped right over it. Maybe it had something to do with my dvd player, i dont know. But overall i love it :) and my 8 year old brother was dancing to it and watched it with me. He doesnt even know who they are and he loved it hahaha :)"	6
Slash makes his solo return with his second album Apocalyptic Love. After listening to it a couple of times, i think that it is a nice upgrade from his solo debut. Apocalyptic Love has a more connected feel about it that better showcases Slash`s trademark no-fills rock along with fine support from Miles Kennedy and the Conspirators. Listening to the album, it is very obvious how well they have gelled together after a lot of touring in the last year.Overall i highly recommend Apocalyptic Love to anyone that loves no-fills, balls to the wall rock.	6
The CD itself is good, but not fantastic.  I just got back from seeing them play live, though, and whoa!  They played a small venue here and tore down the house.  They are extremely energetic, the music is crisp, and Lacey sounded (and looked) great.  I went because a friend of mine had an extra ticket, so I figured what the heck.  I was not disappointed.  The CD doesn't do the live show justice, and for that I give it 4 stars.  If they're coming to a place near you, though, definitely check them out.	6
I'm a an avid viewer of all the teen horrors and comedies that have been  recently coming out. This is one of the bests. Of course, the plot is  predictable, and you have your usual type-cast people (e.g. nerds, jocks,  the beautiful ones. It's just the humour in this movie is better than any  other. Besides 10 Things I Hate About You, but other than, it is! The  actors/actresses really did their part for the movie. Especially Jodi Lynn  O'Keefe who is always awesome at playing the beautiful one. I recommend you  check this one out!	6
With 2 babies in 2 years.  Sleep was a huge issue in this house.  Dr.  Karp's methods are great.  You just need to stick to them.  I think there are a few different methods that work well, it's just a matter of finding what you are comfortable with and sticking it out.  My best advice is watch this and then follow what rings true to you.  Remember it is one thing to watch a dvd and another to hear your baby crying at 4 in the morning.  Stay strong!!  This DVD gives you much needed ammo!	6
I have to admit that I have always had a soft spot for the Powerpuff Girls.  I find the frequently tongue-in-cheek humour to be very witty and like most good cartoons are, this one is thoroughly entertaining for both kids and adults alike.  My favourite Cartoon Network character is actually Dexter's Lab but until they release that on DVD I guess this will have to do as second best.  This DVD has been very well thought out and designed and contains good bonus features as well as 10 great episodes.  Highly recommended for a good laugh!	6
"This was one of the most enjoyable concerts (other than ""live"" shows I attended) I had ever seen John do... he was himself, he was in top form, he still captivated the viewer and entertained with such ease...John Denver is an American Classic -- and is missed a great deal.Thank you, John - for all you did, all you tried to do and all that you were.  You will remain with me as a beacon of hope and will shine on forever....~~~~~""Though the singer is silent, there still is the truth of the song"" -- John Denver"	6
This release is modern science looking out for us music lovers. As well, the great friendship thriving among these men have paved my road for a concert trip. I hope they play most of this album on their fall tour. New sounds abound from all three. BRAVO!...I should add that the lyrics are poetry and should be read. And for those that refuse, maybe a band-aid box would provide some entertainment, and I mean attainment. Sorry, it just seems that some humans are struggling and I don't mean to be cynical, I mean to just say....WAKE UP!!!!!	6
The Song Remains The Same captures the members of Led Zeppelin in all of their 70's American glory in performance at Madison Square Garden. Jimmy Page, John Paul Jones, John Bonham, and Robert Plant are in fine form and the editing make this an entertaining ride from start to finish. The little band member vignettes are a little pretentious (save for Bonham's, which kicks _ss), but it's still amusing. It's worth the dough and a fine companion piece to the double Led Zeppelin DVD that came out a few years back. Highly recommended for any Zep head.	6

"Great concert - the Allman Brothers at thier best since Duane and Berry passed on. Better than live at The Beacon - that should be a bluray catalog as well - it's plenty new enough.  The problem with this DVD is the interviews as others have stated.  They could have been added as bonus content to select off the menu rather than have them embedded in the the concert itself.  Please re-edit and possibly reissue as a bluray with full concert footage and non embedded ""added"" bonus content. Classic Allman Brothers - Its the right thing to do........."	6
I was exploring whether any album could come close to In The Court of the Crimson King after being completely disillusioned by groups like Fever Tree following their similarly near-perfect 1st album.  Same with Led Zeppelin, but that's another story.Of course it is not as good but immediately following the Crimson King album in a party setting with the sub-woofer on, it flowed together quite well.  Now I have to go exploring further as I did with Quicksilver Messenger Service until I had 8 albums, to see if there's another group to collect and study.  It looks promising.	6
"Ananiashvili has the confidence that comes from knowing that she does not have to compromise with the laws of physics.  The rest of the company-- and I dare say the orchestra (it's Japanese)-- is not world class but good enough, but it is the prima ballerina ""natural""  who rates five stars.  (Rothbart actually bops Odette on the noodle accidentally with his hand in Act 3.)  Particularly noteworthy are Ananiashvili's beautiful long arms, which undulate like fronds in subtle undersea currents.  She understands her characters, stays in character, and is charismatic.  See also her vivacious performance in Don Quixote."	6
I loved this movie when I was little and so do my children.  A lot of reviewers have complained about death being a theme, but I disagree about that being a bad thing.  Death is a very real part of the world and kids shouldn't be sheltered from it.  I don't let my kids watch blood and guts movies, but the spider's very natural death is something I have no problem with.I also really love the music in this movie.  The songs range from fun to poignant.  I still know them all by heart from my own childhood.	6
What can I say? This film was done in 1976 so visual editing was still,well, 1976 era type of editing. It's almost watching a home movie. Dont expect bright, crisp scenes. You'll realize this film has a ton of bugs as far as movie editing is concerned. Focus more on the music that these guys wrote and played. That's what this film is all about--- the music.The only sad note to this film for me is that I will never get to see John Bonham play again. He was to me the greatest rock drummer --- all time	6
I really enjoyed the DVD because it is a Russian folk story that features one of the greatest ballerinas ever.  I greatly admire Maya Plisetskaya's technical and performance abilities and I especially enjoyed seeing her execute the fouette turns with the corps de ballet towards the middle of the DVD.  The film was a bit fuzzy, but the story and music were a joy.  I recommend this for children, especially children studying classical ballet because it shows us that ballet does not have to be stiff, sterile or acrobatic to entertain, as is so often the case now.	6
This adaptation of Verdi's opera La Traviata is simply sumptuous and a lavish production. Never before than an opera is transformed into a beautiful film. Ms.Stratas and Mr. Domingo performed and sings with pure gusto and it is a sheer delight. Set designs and costumes are a credit to the production and director Zeffereli excels in his delivery of this opera and presents it as a movie experience. Music performed by The Metropolitan Opera orchestra conducted by James Levine and the music thoroughly shines all the way through.I truly enjoyed this film experience and enjoy the music and performance.	6
THat is a line from march of the pigs song/ video. THis closure set is the best. It has all the videos that were released from nin's beginning until the release of the downward spiral. It  also has live footage from the self-destruct tour from 1995. The concert kind of blows but the videos are awesome. BUT BEWARE THE VIDEOS ARE EXTREMELY GRAPHIC AND DISTURBING. THEY ARE VIOLENT BUT GOOD. This is only out on VHS right now because trent is dealing with law suits for the release on dvd. Don't wait. It won't come out. BUY THIS NOW!!!!!!!	6
"This is the best Rush album since the early 80's...most diehard Rush fans know that there's really not a bum album in the whole lot besides a couple of their early live albums (which sound like they were, to quote Sublime, ""Too drunk to light the bong, too stoned to write the song""), and that horrific, thankfully short-lived blunder into rap known as Roll the Bones, but hey, nobody's perfect! This album is definitely one which gets better and better which each hearing, these guys never cease to amaze me with their individual and collective talents!  Power Trios Rule!!"	6
The best meditation cd money can buy. Also indispensible mood music for writing, painting, blissing out, anything really except driving. My 11-year old son used to be disturbed by the quiet power of this music, now he loves reading to it. I often throw &quot;Doje Ling&quot; into the cd player when I've got a heavy day of deadlines before me. Works wonders. For those curious about meditation books, pick up, &quot;Meditation Made Easy&quot; by Lorin Roche. That and his and Camille Maurine's, &quot;Meditation Secrets for Women&quot; are the two absolute best books out there and complement &quot;Dorje Ling&quot; perfectly.	6
This is a &#34;cleaned up and expanded&#34; version of the 1976 release.  The sound, arrangement, and bonus material are fantastic.  I have fond memories associated with the original version and this new version only adds to those wonderful memories.  Some fans and critics have stated that these concert clips do not represent Zep at their best.  But, for me, I think they still stand head and shoulders above anyone else --- both in terms of musicianship and entertainment.  Unfortunately, I never had the chance to see the band live, but through this DVD set, at least I can imagine.	6
When this film first aired on television after Christmas in 1967, critics panned it for being incomprehensible gibberish. It certainly wasn't what the folks at home were used to for their holiday television. In hindsight, we can see &quot;Magical Mystery Tour&quot; for what it is: a slightly sluggish but fanciful art film, filled with engaging music videos and bits of offbeat comedy. This film predates MTV by a good 13 years, and includes great Beatles recordings (I strongly recommend the &quot;Magical Mystery Tour&quot; soundtrack album.) It remains today a great period piece, and a pleasant piece of surreal filmmaking.	6
In this chapter the history of the Eurythmics, Sophie Muller begins the creative process and collaboration in a successful, where she makes music with images, Annie Lennox putting a woman on a pedestal / Diva, the images are a bit obscure, but so insightful report, our frustrations Emotional everyday, like you Have Place a Chill in My Heart, sorry that this video as well as the We Two are One Too on DVD have not left yet, that was so comprehensive that we live in, luckily an injustice that still exists in its raw form wild and why not!	6
I like this movie a lot because of the good performance and excellent photography.  Domingo's Alfredo is still good enough however, Stratas's Violetta is not good at all in Act I - her voice is quite annoying and it seems that she cannot adjust her breathing while she is singing - things become better when Germont shows up in Act II.  Sound quality is much better than that recorded in an opera house, so is the image quality.  It's a good choice for those who do not really enjoy opera (just like me) or who want to try something different.	6
I always enjoy listening to Stevie Ray Vaughan's excellent guitar work. And it's an exceptional pleasure to watch as well as listen as he performs his fingertip magic. This DVD may not be the best in terms of audio and video quality or content production, but it's SRV. My rating is for the performance, not the production. As far as the production goes, I rate it 3.5 to 4 stars.Note:  I have no idea if there is a content or quality difference between the 1997 release and the 2011 release of this DVD. If anyone knows, please leave a comment.	6
I use to be a big fan back in the day, and I recall enjoying this video a lot. Many years later, I am not quite so enthralled as I once was. Most of Page's solos are pretty sloppy IMHO, and Plant is off quite a bit as well. Some decent performances (Moby Dick is probably the best), but most are mediocore. As for the dream sequences, a bit goofy, but not that bad. Some interesting footage worked in as well. Worth a look if your a fan, but I would prefer to see a better performance from these guys.	6
Fellow Carpenters Fans:This is the DVD release of the &quot;Yesterday Once More&quot; video, just redesigned. The quality is excellant and if you're a Carpenters fan you'll LOVE IT!It's sad for us US Carpenters fans that they are no longer releasing newer material. &quot;As Time Goes By&quot; was the last release and it was only released in JAPAN, excuse me, but... I thought the Carpenters were born and started in the USA???The last US release was the compilation CD &quot;Singles 1969-1981&quot;, another compilation!Richard is currently working on a Christmas album. Let's hope the US will see this!AlwaysCarpenterstoyou . tipod . com	6
I was not impressed when this started: the sound is rubbish, the video quality not much better, and poor old Alice is almost falling-down drunk. Things do improve tho, and when we get to the final series of songs - Black Widow, Steven, and the incendiary School's Out, ALice is bringing the house down. I was converted. I've always loved Welcome To My Nightmare, and was stoked to see Tony Levin playing on this - although interestingly uncredited.As several others have said, for all its faults this is history in the making and it deserves its place in the rock pantheon.	6
This CD is very well done, and I am very impressed...although, I am somewhat not a fan of this particular style of music, I love how artists are beginning to reach people where they are-Skillet is a perfect example of this....many people a huge fans of this style of music, however, some get tired of only hearing negative, un-christian messages, like myself....I quit listening to todays pop music because of the unclean words, and nasty messages that made my walk with CHrist even more difficult-now I can enjoy the style of music without having to mentally block out the nasty messages	6
I already owned Into The Woods and was in awe of Ms. Peters' performance in it, so I purchased this. I was astounded at her performing and vocal ability, and much more astounded when I found out her age (exact words: &quot;but, she's so HOT!&quot;). Except for &quot;We're In The Money&quot;, all the songs and/or performances are wonderful (some of the songs were only made interesting by her rendition). Also, if anyone who heard she will be playing Madame Rose in Gypsy is doubting her ability to play the role, they ought to see her rendition of &quot;Some People&quot; on this video.	6
...we also agree that Rosie is a bit toooo much for this prime time Sesame Street outing, but, that's okay because, things like Chris Rock bantering with Oscar the Grouch, and the Fugees jamming with Big Bird and the Mayor of Margaritaville literally kickin' it with Kermit and the Amphibians, and tunes from the Mighty Mighty Bosstones, and Shawn Colvin (not to mention  Muppets' two straight men in this, the sardonic Jon Stewart and the always funny David Alan Grier) makes this a show that most parents and grand parents don't mind watching with the youngsters....a musical, magical 55 minutes of fun.	6
"I really liked Mythology and Black Utopia, though the engineering / mix on BU was poor. But this album is even worse. Musically it goes no where. Almost like he was trying to copy previous attempts but ran out of ideas. The ""Featuring Billy Idol and Slash"" thing is an absolute joke. Some how he got these guys to do an absolutely horrible version of In The Summertime. It's so bad it's hard to believe any one would put it on a CD other than to draw attention and sales from the names. Too bad, I had higher expectations from this guy."	6
This is the best VHS out their with a collection of music videos featuring Stevie Ray Vaughan and Double Trouble also Live Performences. I would rate this a 5 because this could not get any better the music videos are really cool this is a must have for an SRV fan. My favorite is Couldnt Stand The Weather when SRV is playing his custom hamilton guitar in a rain storm very cool! I also like the western side of Change It. This is such a cool movie I hope they can release this sometime on DVD it would be sweeter so enjoy!	6
We love this video. I love that it teachs my kids about babies, dogs, and farms. All three shows on this video are done very well. And I really can't say that with all Elmo's world shows. This video opens the way to talk to young kids about babies, dogs and farms. Which is great. I'm a home daycare provider. Over the yrs I have collected over 100 kids videos. Elmo's World - Babies, Dogs & More! seems to entertain my daycare kids ages 14 months to 5 yrs greatly. I'd say it's in the top 20 favorite videos of my daycare kids.	6
Thats what discribes this movie. This is one of the best movies out there. It has a good cast and the costumes are awesome. To bad they didn't do that with the hulk. The costumes make the turtles & Splinter more life like. This is ttruely an awesome movie. I love this movie. The only thing wrong with it is that they didn't stay true to the Origin of the TMNT. But it is still an awesome movie i recomend it.If you like this movie Check out,1. TMNT 2: The Secret Of The ooze2. TMNT 33. TMNT The orginal soundtrack to the movie	6
Just a notch below the legendary Snow White sits the timeless, sweeping beauty and simplicity of Bambi.  Sporting an incredible new transfer this edition shines light years beyond the previous VHS incarnation.  Colors appear slightly brighter and the soundtrack rings crystal clear.  The extras on this platinum edition are varied and quite enjoyable as well w/the OLD MILL short  animated short being my favorite. Another 1 hr and 10 min extra delves deep into the meetings and processes that formed this classic.  Deeper than most Disney films and second only to Snow White sits this incredible testament to animation and Walt Disney's genius.	6
One thing about chargers these days is the build quality.  I've owned and thrown out so many that I've come to the realization that the cheap plastic $5.00 ones are the ones that break the quickest.  So I decided to spend a little more this time.  The Scosche is defintely built well, feels great too.  I've plugged in all my devices and all charge well.  I would buy again.Oh, i've purchased wiring harnesses from Scosche.  They sell good quality stuff.	7
This is only a 1 amp charger, and does work very well.  And you know, it looks cool with the light up Motorola logo.....really cool.But be forewarned, it will NOT fast charge a Galaxy Note 2......it will charge faster than a standard USB charge........but not as fast as a 2 amp charger.  And if you are using your Note 2 as a GPS, it will barely maintain the current charge.  If used normally, it will charge, but just not real fast.	7
This is my second charger like this (lost my first one... then found it the day this new replacement charger came in... figures).  Both have worked well with a Moto Droid X and Moto Droid Razr Maxx.  It charges just fine, at about the same rate as the OEM stock charger, so I assume it is around a 1A charger (probably just below 1A).  I don't care for the length of this thing; however, it's worked better than other chargers I've had.	7
This headset fit great in my ear, its look is very cool, but a few flaws:1. Volume buttons are not easy to reach once the unit is fitted in your ear.2. Using it in windy conditions may get you in an uncomfortable conversation (hello?... are you there? It feels like you're within a hurricane...), and I don't mean only outdoors, you maybe inside your car with the A/C on and if it's blowing right at your face, you'll get this kind of problem	7
I chose this, because this has flash light and laser point. I guess they will be useful in daily life, but...1. 5200mah capability is good. ( one iphone and extra device..but not full 2 devices at one time)2. holding phone and this item..is not comfortable. ( not recommeded things thoud)3. And compared to other 5200 mah batter pack, i think this does not have full competency. I do not have scientific data to prove this. Based on recharging process, i felt many times.	7
I have no idea if this is a real Motorola product or a great copy.  Either way, it is incredibly well made and works.  I refused to pay the rip off prices at my local cellphone shop, and the pices at Walmart and Target weren't much better.For less than $5 I got a well made item that works very well.  I'm not sure yet how rapid of a charger it really is, but it works.  That's all I care about.I highly recommend this item.	7
This car charger is authentic. I checked/inspected it and did not find anything wrong with it. For less than $10, this is a steal. It works with my Motorola Atrix.The charger has a blue, dim blue light that will remain on, as long as it is being used. The cord is pretty standard, nothing to add about is durability, if you've seen others, this is not different. Except, this charger is very fast.This should work with any cell phone that has a Micro-USB connection.	7
Bought this for my new AT&T; Galaxy SII, the case arrived super fast, its fits the phone perfectly and snug. I have no issues with any buttons, and the rubber is in a smooth, sort of laminated finish. It does not stick to your pockets. Overall, I am extremely happy with the purchase, especially for so cheap.And just FYI: This is for the AT&T; (i777), or International (i9100) Galaxy SII.This WILL NOT FIT Sprint, T-Mobile or the AT&T; Galaxy SII Skyrocket phones. You've been warned.	7
This is a nice concept.  It allows the holster to orient either horizontal or vertically.  The only problem is that the first one I got...the clip snapped the first day I wore it.  The replacement is holding up much better, but it's gotten a bit floppy.  It would probably work fine for someone who was more sedentary...but I'm very active and put a lot of stress on stuff.  Still, I have it, and use it from time to time when I want to impress someone.	7
"This arrived in what appeared to be a Nokia retail package, and had Nokia insignia on the cable. It appeared to be genuine. The package lists only a few Nokia phones by number, then says ""and compatible phones"". Orientation of the unique Nokia plug (?POP) is not obvious and the plug does not go in easily(until it's perfectly lined up). For my 6126 the plug needs to be oriented with the Nokia insignia to the front of the phone. Once connected the cable worked perfectly."	7
This is my second KRZR. I love this phone. I finally broke my first one, but I pushed it to the limits. It had been washed, soaked jet skiing, dropped, kicked, chewed up by my dog (twice) and finally destroyed by me trying to replace pieces without the right screwdriver. This phone lasted through it all. The best feature is that if you dry it out after immersing it in water, it still works. If you are hard on phones, I would recommend this one.	7
I've tried several of these cell phone signal boosters, and I have to say, not one of them is worth a dime.  Do they boost your cell signal?  Maybe...a little....sort of... not really.  Yes, the bars on my Sprint phone do jump a tad when I turn this on, but it's barely noticeable and certainly not worth the exorbitant price.  This one just feels like tech snake-oil.  No, moving to different locations made no difference.  Nothing did.  This thing is just a placebo.  Don't bother.	7
After getting myself a new VX8700, I picked up a new VX8300 for my girlfriend. The VX8300 is not the prettiest or thinest phone Verizon offers, but it seems to be one of their best performers. Sound quality, speakerphone, RF, and battery life all seem very good. The camera takes decent pictures. It has just about all the features you expect in a phone today too. With a new contract, you can get it for $50 or less. At this price, I give it 5 stars.	7
The headset works pretty well with my treo 755p. In fact, it's the best headset I've found for the treo (tried plantronics and motorola previously without success). However, the ear hooks were missing from the package and Samsung customer service wouldn't even speak to me without me providing my phone's ESN numbers. WTH? I also attempted to make a request on Samsung's service website, which also would not function correctly. I called Amazon CS and they sent a replacement after 4 minutes on the phone. AWESOME!	7
I received my Motorola H710 today.  I was able to pair it, charge it and use it without using the instructions, it is that easy to use.  From what I can see, the sound is superb.  It connects immediately when you open the boom.  I had a Motorola H500 previously and had nothing but problems.  I highly recommend this model.  From the reviews I have read it offers superior wind noise reduction also.  Can't wait for summer to open my sunroof and give it a try!!	7
One drawback of any soap-bar, or candy-bar style phone is that you have to lock the keyboard with some button combination every time you put it away or it will dial the last person you called, or someone on speed-dial when you inadvertently push one of it's keys. This holster has magnets in it that automatically puts the Pearl in standby mode, which disables the keys. The belt-clip also allows you to rotate the holster into the most comfortable position you can for driving, or  walking around.	7
I love love love this unit, and make sure to bring it with me whenever I know I'm going to be out and about for the day, and my phone is not going to survive.  It's absolutely essential on plane flights, long days at the beach, etc. I cannot recommend this or some other type of external charging highly enough.  It's hard to be without your phone, so having this unit is a no brainer.  You can plug it in and put it in your pocket.  Easy	7
I received the item in a timely manor, but the best thing about this product, was the outstanding response I received by the seller. It was an excellent purchase experience and excellent customer service.  I would buy from this seller again.  I was unable to make the item work with my blackberry 8310, and the seller provided me the opportunity to return it for a full refund, however, my life got busy and the time alloted to return it expired, but that's my fault and not the seller.	7
Holy mackerel, these things are awesome! Stows so very conveniently away and works very intelligently, locking in place wherever decide to stop it, rolling back up with just a tug. Have only had a couple of times where it decided to tangle up a touch when recoiling, but with almost no effort was able to pull back out and start over, coiling up properly like does all the other times. Buy a handful and have 'em in car, at computer, stereo - they're so inexpensive but so awesome!	7
We finally tried the Plantronics CS-55 Dect 6.0 Digital Wireless Office Headset and it is AWESOME!  We were using Plantronics CS50 headsets and they just give off feeback and crackle.The Plantronics CS-55 Dect 6.0 Digital Wireless Office Headset is really great, good sound quality, no feedback, no buzzing in your ear!  And people can actually hear you!We have 7 wireless headsets working in our office and 2 are the CS-55.  Once the CS50 ones break (which will be soon) I will be replacing them all with the CS-55!	7
I have never been up with technology.  My friend always had music on his phone and was listening to it all the time.  I wanted to do the same.  Going into this not sure I came out very pleased.  I have a M520 phone and I listen to music all the time now.  It has loud speakers and eliminates background noises.  I haven't quite figured out how to answer the calls because when I hit the button on he headphones my phone freezes up.  I really enjoy them.	7
This is no ordinary charger, it supplies LOTS of power. Most chargers really do cheap out on the amperage.  This feeds my power-hungry HTC Thunderbolt beautifully.I tried doing all of the power-hungry stuff you can do, simultaneously: GPS, 4G, and access point on and maxed out by a connected computer. Even after all of this, it still managed to charge after a long time. The phone got plenty hot.The first one I got only worked for a day.  Got a completely free one shipping paid for both ways.	7
Great for working in the yard or exercise.  These guys are compact & lightweight.  Comfort is good, though it decreases slightly on  extended use.  The earphones stay centered on your ears.  Phone call quality is excellent for both parties.  The controls are easy to use & well designed.The only negative was that the bass response was not as strong as I had hoped for, but they sound good & work great.  For the price, they can't be beat & they are quite handy on a cold windy day.	7
I bought this micro usb cable because it was cheap, and that it is. I use this with my Nexus s 4g from sprint and although it does indeed charge my device it causes some major issues, such as screen lag, my computer not being able to recognize what kind of device this is, and causing my phone to constantly jump into car mode. So if you need a real quick cable for basic charging, this will do it, anything else...spend the extra buck on a higher end cable.	7
I read a lot of reviews on a lot of headsets before purchasing this one. I've had it for a month now and so far the performance is just fine. I use it mostly in the car with no problems. People tell me they can hear me just fine. The battery life is good; the lights on the headset are helpful indicators. I like the small lightweight size.My wife tried it out and was pleased with it. So I've purchased a red one for her....she'll get it for Christmas.	7
Wow!  What a cute battery case! I saw a Christian sister with one of these on her phone!  That gave ne an idea-I decided to order me and my sister a battery case-mine is white, (since my phone is white), and my sister's is black,(since her phone is blue).Anyway, these little guys give you power for your phone! If we run out juice, especially when on the go, we can just connect this case to our phone, and it is POWER ON THE GO!! (I'm just concerned about the functionality).	7
The Phone charger works, it charges the phone. However, while the phone is charging it continually beeps as when the battery is too low.It will not stop beeping while it is charging until the battery reaches a certain percentage.I do not think this is the correct charger to be using on the phone I have.Now I am worried based on other reviewers that the battery may blow on the phone and I'll have to replace that too.I would not recommend buying this charger.The charger from my old blackberry works better.	7
I've been having it for weeks. It works fine when both listening to music and talking via Skype. The mic pick up my voice quite well even with that small hole away from mouth. Once fully charged, it lasts a long time when using it for stereo music streaming.Pros: Sound quality is great, as being a bluetooth headphone. Battery lasts long enough. The microphone does pick up sound perfectly.Cons: Feel a little pinched above ears after wearing it for a while. It would be great if the belt is expandable.	7
This is a nice looking case, the only problem I had with this was that the inside is not painted, looks like they tried using just enough paint on the outside to make it look good. I guess it doesn't really matter once the case is snaped on to the phone but it still bugs me to see the poor quality...If you must buy this style of case, you might want to consider one called Kroo Shell, I'm not sure if they make it for the 1st Gen iPhone though.	7
So I have been using the charger and it is unbelievable!Pros:Light weightShape is made so that it fits great in your hand.Holds an amazing charge!charges in 6 hours so over night you dont even feel it.The LED light and red laser are actually coming in handy surprisingly. theLED is a great use but the red laser is just entertaining.Cons:I only have 1 con to this fantastic devicethe way you turn on the LED, laser, and the product itself unless someonereads the manual, no one would know how to do it.	7
Okay, this little guy ROCKS!  When plugged in to an outlet, it will support 2 HDDs, a external ODD, and a printer with no issues.  Also, during a move I misplaced my power cord, so I called up the company... WOW, for free, the NEXT DAY, they shipped me out a replacement.  I would DEF. buy from them again, and will use more of these as the need arises.Also, it's been quite some time now since the purchase (over a year) and it works perfectly like the day I got it.	7
First, the White Screen of Death Issue.  I had 3 units til instead of returning tp Cingular.  I sent it back to SONY.  NO more problems.  They flashed it with the latest firmware and it works fine.  The WOD will seem to occur after you disconnect after a file transfer.  However, wait 20 seconds and the phone reboots.Pro: Loud and easy to hear from.Con:  Buttons and keypad is hard to get use to.Pro:  The camera is fine for a phone cam.Con: Battery drain is bad, when you play the MP3 player.	7
Screen is absolutely beautiful, charging either by car jack or wall takes only minutes to get a full charge that lasts days.  Quickdial, camera, online button, voicedialing all great.  Antenna is excellent, but not perfect.  Walkman is good, but could use a little more human factors work.  Small as it is, the speaker and microphone is phenomenal and cuts through noise very well.  Adding google maps and Yahoo! mail to the phone and it's a multimedia powerhouse that plays music and keeps you up to date.  Excellent bang for the buck.	7
This was a very nice bluetooth headset until I lost it. since it so small, I tuck it away and now I can't find it ;(. anyways, I had 2 great headset by Plantronics and samsung. both are very good, but if I had to choose, I would choose Samsung for it connects to my phone without too much hassle compare to plantronics 510 voyager, where I had to constantly reset my phone to get connect it. on the other hand Plantronics Voyager 510 voice is far superior to Samsungs (IMO).	7
I have had experience putting screen protectors on phones for several years.  I generally do pretty good with installation and have a minimum amount of air bubbles underneath the screen.With this protector I cleaned the phone very well before installing and ended up with numerous air bubbles/pockets.  I was able to use a squeegie like device and get most of them out but the ones that are still there are seemingly magnified due to the mirror surface.  It makes them much more apparent than a standard clear or anti-reflective screen protector.	7
Shows up totally deformed (top of the case doesn't even touch the phone because it was cast crooked), and I have to pay to mail it back to them if I want a replacement? I don't want a replacement anymore, I want a functional phone case. Definitely a &#34;get what you pay for&#34; kind of thing. The case is pretty inflexible, so when I took the case off, it also pulled off the back of the phone. Not the end of the world, but definitely a crappy case. Would absolutely not recommend.	7
I like this case. the only thing that made me worry was the thin section by the volume rocker, but it has held up well. I like that it doesn't hurt my ear when i talk on my phone. i like that it doesn't interfere when I text. I love that it doesn't add any bulk to the phone and still protects my phone. I have been using this case for about a month. It meets all my requirements. 1 fits 2 works good 3 price is great 4 protects my phone.	7
I like the stylus, it feels like it's built well, not super light and not super heavy. I'm not fond of all the different types of attachments that it comes with. I mean really who needs a plastic springy thing on it. Well to each their own I guess. Only 2 things I'd change 1) the clip. It hasn't broken off, but it just feels like it will and 2) I wish they made a smaller end to it, It'll be great for surfing but for hand writing, I'm not so sure.	7
Really, the only way this thing would be better is if I could somehow unplug it and use it elsewhere without unplugging the original appliance.  Too bad that's not really possible.As the title suggests, it's loads of fun to play around with, more features than most users would probably take advantage of, and you learn a LOT about what really consumes power in the household (turns out my computer system costs more to run than the refrigerator).  You just gotta buy it and try it for yourself, worth the money by far!	7
This seems to be a great charger - when it works. It seems to work fine with my wife's Tracfone - a Motorola EX124G but would not charge my Tracfone - an LG 500G... so I'm reducing the rating by one star. I suspect the blame may lie more on the LG phone side, but I am still disappointed that I need another charger to charge my LG phone.By the way, I highly recommended buying from a reputable retailer to make sure you get the real thing. I bought mine from Amazon.	7
Well designed.  High power (1.0 Amp) so it can recharge your phone more quickly. Fits my car's cigarette lighter plug snugly and stays in.  The bright blue light is a bit much, but I'm getting used to it.  Cord could be longer.  Fits any phone that needs a micro-USB charger cable.  High quality construction.  Buy this -- you won't regret it.Warning: some phones, like the Galaxy S3, won't charge well if the supplied amperage is not at least 1.0 Amps.  Often, the amperage is not specified in the listings -- buyer beware.	7
This is a really nice USB 2.0 hub. It works way better than the 7-port DLink it replaced. The LED lights are a bit bright, but for me it's not much of an issue since the hub lives down on the floor in my setup. I agree that it would be nice to be able to to turn them off though if it's too bright, just cover over them with a strip of tape-problem solved.I am impressed with this hub and would recommend it.Note-it is actually smaller than it looks in the pictures.	7
The case took almost a week to arrive. You buy a cheap case, you're going to get cheap case quality. Stay away. The inside of the case that contacts the phone is not smooth at all. Will scratch your phone. Looks as if someone dropped it in dirt. Could not clean whatever gunk was on the case. Thank God it didn't scratch the aluminium on the case. A credit card didn't even slide all the way down into the case. Good luck trying to fit two in there. Spend your money else where.	7
Yeah it's a sim card and well my phone doesn't have 3G so I don't really care that it works with 3G because it doesn't matter.I don't know why they want reviews on sim cards. I find SIM cards outdated though, They are massive compared to Micro SD cards and yet they hold next to no information when compared.The only reason SIM cards are good is because they go in GSM phones and if you unlock your phone you can cart it off to another service provider without issue. Especially quad band phones.	7
We have two, and we love them. They work very well, like much better than the Motorola's we had, and these are quite stylish and unobtrusive. Now, I will say that I switch back and forth between the smallest ear piece and none at all - with it, it fits better and you can hear better, but it starts hurting a little after a while, have to take a break; without it, I can wear it all day, but, it dangles a little awkwardly and sound is sacrificed, a little, but certainly bearable.	7
I absolutely LOVE this case! Its super thin, you can hardly feel it on the phone, the volume buttons are easy to access, and I the top and bottom cut outs are one of my favorite features. The only part I don't love is that scratches are easily accumulated and I toss my phone in my purse so I've already acquired quite a few.. But that's the way it does with any hard case. I got one to keep as a backup and I'm ordering one of the soft TPU cases today :)	7
Very good device, Easy to use and set up, fit is comfortable, sound quality is very good, and stand by /talk time are great, I have had a few other bluetooth ear pieces that fit better but sound was poor, longer stand by and talk time, but I figuerd if I was on the phone that long I need to re think my life, when I first purchsed it because of it's size I thought I would loose it, year and a half later my dog chewed it, Great device for the money.	7
I actually never used it but here is why.  When I finally got the package it was folded in half with tire marks all over it.  Like the mail man folded it, laid in on the street, backed up right on top of it, and proceeded to power brake and burn out on top of it.  needless to say the screen had unfixable creases and was barely still in the wrapper.it might be a good protector and it really probably had absolutely nothing to do with the seller but I was pretty steamed.	7
I bought this recently and did not expect much, as it was only $2.99 shipped to my door.  For that much money, how can you go wrong?  So, I have not used it to transfer data yet, as it it plugged into my PC at work just for charging.  When plugged in, my Palm Pixi prompts me, just as the factory cable does, to transfer or charge.  I have used this cable about 10x to charge now, and it works great!  Do not hesitate to purchase this if you need another cable, or two!	7
"Sound quality is pretty good.  The wind ""technology"" is not bad.  Stong winds, blowing sand etc,  is going to get heard with this.  But for the price it is comfortable.  For someone who has to buy special adapters to get Blue tooth devices to stay in my ear I am impressed with this.  I wish it had a call end button on the thing.  But the mute button is great.  I would buy this again.  And i like it almost as much as my jawbone.  Paring is not an issue with wired devices.....  ;)"	7
This is a great case for the Samsung Galaxy S3 and BoxWave does a great job in making a quality classy durable product.  I love that it incorporates my wallet with my phone so that they are together instead of having to carry it separate.  It provides access to all the buttons, camera, charge slots, speakers and it makes it look not so obvious when it is closed.  Many people often mistake it for a journal, calendar, bible, etc.  I also like that it protects my screen in the closed position.  A great product.	7
This bluetooth headset is tiny compared to others I've researched. I purchased it for my daughter, and she loves it.  It paired easily with her Env2 Verizon phone.  I called her to test it and I could hear her clearly and she reports she can hear well on it too. There was no feedback noise or echo.  She reports that it is very comfortable, and she has been wearing it for long periods of time without a problem.  The standby time is 70 hours, so it doesn't have to be constantly charging. Great product.	7
This is so handy.  I get about 175% charge on my Nexus S 4G (which admittedly has a battery on the smaller side compared to most phones today).  I use it when I travel and it works awesome.  I bought it before they changed the look/features of it and it looks even better now - the battery itself uses USB to charge (why didn't they do that in the first place?).  After dozens of uses, it still charges just as much as it did on the first day (I've had it for 5 months).	7
Unfortunately, I purchased mine when it was $100 and have never been able to use it.  I didn't return it right away because I thought I would be able to read the directions that came with it and figure out how to unmute it, but have never been able to.  I can hear the other people, but they can't hear me.  No matter what I do, it won't unmute.  The buttons on it are very small and difficult to use when it's in your ear.  I finally got a different bluetooth that works just fine.	7
I really like this inexpensive lightweight bluetooth headset!  Works well on my end, but sometimes the person on the other end of the call hears an echo.  Stays in my ear great without the clip that goes around your ear.  It charges up in a protective flip top box, so the headset doesn't have to plug directly into wall charger.  I store my headset in the small charging box and carry it in the small box in my pocket when not in use.  I love it that this was only $18!!!  Can't beat that price!!	7
I do a lot of freeway driving and I've tried 2 of these speaker phones with myTreo and the noise cancellation feature is poor. It works fine below 45 mph but the faster I go the more my callers complain about the road noise. Also you have to turn off Bluetooth on the phone when you turn off the speaker phone. The phone thinks it's still connected to the speaker phone,it will show that it's not connected to any Bluetooth devise but keeps the phone mic and speaker on mute until Bluetooth is turned off.	7
Buying these headphones was a terrible mistake. The sound is flat and lifeless and the volume controls do nothing. I bought these to use with my Palm Pre. I don't know if the problem is Pre related, the Pre's bluetooth stack has a lot of deficiencies, or if these are just lousy headphones. Either way the combination of the Pre and these headphones is not a good one, Palm Pre owners should avoid these. I have a cheap pair of wired headphones that have an order of magnitude better sound when used with my Pre.	7
This phone is flashy and feels good in the hand, but it could not hold a connection to any of my bluetooth devices (headset, handheld, or desktop computer). My old Siemens s56, on the other hand, worked beautifully with all of the above.If you hunt around the web, you will find many websites with people complaining about the lack of drivers for this phone and the cavelike silence from Nokia when asked for help.If your needs are limited to making phonecalls and taking snapshots, this phone will probably satisfy you. If you need Bluetooth, stay away.	7
I origanally purchased this phone thinking it had voice dialing similar to the motorola v710. Unfortunately is uses the old style of voice dial where you have to train your voice for each phonebook entry. The v710 does not require this and utilizes true speech recognition software. Since this was the most important feature to me I am returning the razr and exchanging it for the v710. To bad, the razr is superior in most other categories except the one most importand to me. If it had true nex technology voice recogition I would keep it.	7
This is a terrific device.  I use it with my Motorola RAZR V3 and it works great.  I don't know what I did without a wireless headset.  Two things that could be better - first it doesn't recognize ring tones from my phone (but I think that is the phone's problem not necessarily the headset), and second, it occassionally will drop the signal from my phone causing me to scramble to figure out how to go from the headset to my phone.  This doesn't happen very often so it really isn't that big of a deal.	7
Works fine. But I'm still not happy. This is my third/fourth Plantronics headset.This one  bought for dual pairing with my LT and my cell phone.(iPhone).It works fine with both.I am subtracting marks for the followinga) Changing charger designs. Third headset, none of the chargers are interchangeable, so I always get the AC charger, but have to buy the car chargerb) For iPhone, this works only for the phone. Music will not work. Now I am looking instead at the Plantronics 855 Stereo Headset - do handle both = phone/music and still do dual pairing with LT	7
"Searched for ""droid 3 chargers"" when making my purchase. This was the first product to pop up, had decent reviews, and was cheap. I purchased 3. The product arrived on time. HOWEVER this product does NOT fit our droid 3 phones. I contacted customer service over the course of 9 times. No results in replacement, return or refund. Contactd by phone and w/in the first 2 min of the convo the F-bomb was dropped twice. Very offensive and unprofessional. Needles to say, I have 3 chargers that dont fit any of my phones. Anyone wanna trade?"	7
I drive a truck and found out how hard is finding a good bluetooth headset. Many I have tried worked fine, but the biggest problem was that other party could not hear me (because of engine noise). When I accidentally found this one I gave it a try. And it is awesome. People think that I am talking straight to my phone. Call quality in my opinion is even better when I use this headset.PROS:- perfect voice quality- battery lasts long- noise cancelling microphone makes others to hear you- solidCONS:- bulky- expensive (but worth this money)	7
This phone has grown on me.  At first I wasn't sure I needed all this stuff, it felt a bit heavy, I was unsure of the swivel design, and I felt guilty for buying such an expensive phone.  But now I know I'd buy it again.  It's still a little heavy (compared to the Razr, which was my other choice) but the reception is great, it has lots of functions, and the interface is easy to navigate.  Best of all, the speaker phone function is one of the best I've ever heard.  It's loud and clear.	7
I love these because they have done an excellent job of protecting my phone screens on ALL my phones! What's great about these is they have line and numbers, a grid that's formed to help you make a better, smarter cut for your mobile's screen. I even give these as gifts because people don't realize how much you touch your screen. It needs to be protectedThese are the best and I will continue to use these and search for larger sizes. These are the ones that should be on everyone's list. Great stocking stuffers as well!	7
This is a very nice looking case and the Droid X fits nicely in it.  As another reviewer stated you have to modify it some so you can attach a charging cable to it.  That's not so bad. But the clip that installs on the case does not stay on securely and if you are getting out of your vehicle or up from a chair the seat belt or chair arm will pop the case right off the clip.  Luckily the case protects it well enough but I still don't like it coming off that easy.	7
I have an XM radio SkyDock plugged in to my 2006 Toyota 4runner.  The design of the Skydock's lighter plug makes it very stable and very difficult to remove.  I added one of these unit's inside my center console then cut off the plug end and soldered the wires to the terminals on the existing lighter socket.  Haven't had a single problem yet.If you are doing something similar, make sure you take into account the clearance you will need when the lid to the console is closed and something is plugged into one of the sockets.	7
There are so many great, lengthy reviews about this phone already, I'll keep this one short and simple.It's a great phone.  And if you have an 8125 or 8525, then it's time to upgrade.If you're still carying a PDA and a cell phone, then this is the phone for you.  All in one, with GPS, a decent music player, a good camera, and a great operating system (WM6).A quick tip: don't bother with the $10/mo TomTom service.  Download the free Microsoft Live Search or Google Maps applications which both work perfectly with this device's built-in GPS.	7
This case is ok , but there are certainly better ones out there for cheaper.I ordered this case with high expectation thinking i was going to recieve a brand name product from Boxwave , instead i recieved a generic case with no branding .There are other cases here on amazon and other sites that are exactly the same thing i recieved for less then half the price this one is being sold for.For some reason my comments doesnt get approved im not sure why , just letting you all know my personal experience with this transaction .	7
Although the plastic looks and feels like very cheap plastic and as if were to fall it'd come apart easily (mine has yet to fall), this is a nice idea of having a AC (home) and DC (on the road) charger for your Kindle or such.Keep in mind though you NEED a tip that's appropriate for your device.  Be it the A00 tip for your Kindle or whatever.  Having this alone will not do anything for you.It comes with a nice black bag to keep both chargers and the wire spool inside of along with the tip.	7
Yes - I use this about once ever two months...The latest case - I compared the Blendtec Blender which consumed 1546 watts on max while making a smoothie and then compared my old Ninja 1100 (rated for 1100 watts) but it only consumed 320 Watts on max!!! That is why it can't break down seeds and it SUX!!!I also detected that the ninja uses 2 watts while plugged in and off but the blendtec uses 0w.  Very handy device and it is a must for all that care about saving energy and giving our world a future.	7
These are complete cheaters. First of all, the charger never fit my N73 phone slot. Secondly, after I wrote my 1st review criticisizing the product, they called me up saying that they will send me a new replacement charger and I should remove my negative feedback from Amazon. I waited for almost 3 weeks and the charger never showed up. I tried calling the same number from where I got the call, and no response.Complete waste of money, waste of time and a useless product which I had to trash in 10 minutes after I received it.	7
I have had this headset for several months now, and not liking much about this headset other than its long battery life. This headset works OK, but the sound quality is poor and it does not function well in conditions other than perfect, ie. no background or wind noise, and very close to handset. I do like the feature of the headset turning off, when boom mike closed because thats where the battery savings comes from. Other than that I find nothing redeeming about this headset, I believe Motorola will discontinue this model because of its severe flaws.	7
"The weight is nice and balance on the year is good.  The features are good, but one must remember certain button combinations for extended features (like press two buttons at the same time to mute the microphone).  The battery life is good.  A significant issue is that it picks up surrounding noise better than the person's voice who is taking, which means that it often can't be used.  If you don't drive a very quiet car, like a BMW or Mercedes, then users may complain that they can't hear you and ask you to ""pick up the phone."""	7
I have had this phone for two months now and it is the best one I have owned,I have had three razr's and many other so called cutting edge phones even the V3i and none are as good as this,as for the pebl it is simple to open unless you are a butter fingered fool,and as for the finish wearing off on the keypad well mine is just fine.The phone is made better than the flimsey Razr is,you want a quality phone that works as well as it looks get this phone,you want cheap made buy something else.	7
Boxwave has done it again. This case is a fantastic case. I just received it so a 4 star rating for now till I have had it for a week or so but for 1.50 there is no way you can go wrong. From past expericence with Boxwave I can tell you I will be updating to a 5 star rating. The  grip is perfect,the fitting is perfect, the holes for all the external plugs and features are alighned perfect and 1.50 cost, well you dont need to figure that one out. Already purchased a back up one.	7
"I've owned bluetooth devices by Scala, Motorola, and Plantronics.  The Jawbone is the first unit I've used in which no one has asked, ""Are using a bluetooth?""  I think that, in and of itself speaks volumes.  The only drawback I've encountered is loss of pairity (if that's a word!).  It seems like about every couple of days it becomes unpaired.  Trying to reconnect doesn't work.  I have to remove the device from the phone and start all over again.  I'm not sure why this happens so frequently but I still believe the Jawbone is a superior bluetooth device."	7
Product looks solidly built. The plastic feels velvety smooth. The N85 doesn't charge on this but that's a Nokia issue, not USB device issue. The ipod touch 2nd Gen charges, tho. So it works.I thought it was going to be too high for my VW jetta since it sticks straight up but there's enough space there to stick whatever you want to charge.Product works! Mygearstore shipped it quickly. Not as fast as the Prime 2 day but it was fast enough.UPDATED Jan2012: After 2 years, the product just stopped working. Green light would flicker in/out. Threw it out.	7
This thing is awsome!!  I use it for my iphone 4 and I don't know how I lived without it! I keep it with me when I'm on the go with no charger around. On my first full charge, I was able to successfully charge me iphone 4 from 20% to full about 3 times.  From my experience it takes about 1 hour for every 20% to charge.My only wish is that it came with a cable or a somewhat, built it cable. Or at least a case that can carry both the battery and an iphone cable.	7
"This is an absolute steal when it comes to cases.  It's not as ""rubbery"" as some cases.  Has a great shape, and is thin enough to provide great protection without adding a lot of bulk to an already large phone.  The only con is that the buttons aren't as responsive as I would like.  But for $3, this is a wonderful case.UPDATE (8/07/13): Unfortunately the inability to feel the volume and unlock buttons was a little much to overcome, so I had to get rid of it.  Still not bad if you don't mind getting used to the feel."	7
I've had a couple of the &#34;beanbag&#34; dash holders for my GPS navigator.  While some claim that those things stay in place, my Garmin GPS slid off the dash one time too many.  I had seen one of these sticky pads once before, so I though it worth a shot.  I super-glued it to the center of the bottom of the beanbag GPS holder, and it transformed the thing into a secure dash-top holder.  Yes, the combined device is now a bit more expensive than it should have been, but the holder was sunk cost.  This made it useful.	7
I had high expectation for this headphone since I owned one Etymotic before and liked it. Once I got it, I put it on my phone and the plug didn't work properly. The headphone kept disconnecting and reconnecting back with phone while I was walking my dog. First, I thought it might be my phone since it is about two years old. So I put it on my boyfriend's phone (Galaxy SIII) and magic happened... The headpone doesn't fit in completely and I had to push it to get connected. So disappointed and returning it, waiting for UPS pick-up.	7
i like camera phones, but i can't believe this phone don't have usb cable to upload pics..i have to pay $.25 for sending each pics..Viewing all camera phones, this one is pretty nice..It's got flash, and it's got 4 different types of resolutions..It zooms in more than i expected..Other than camera, for contact list, it gives you to save #s, pic, ringtones for a person..I think thats good..i guess that's all i'm gonna say..Overall, phone is decent.For other viewers, if you wanna buy this, you should buy it now, and don't wait cause more updated phones will come out soon	7
The last Bluetooth headset I used was a Motorola something-or-the-other, and frankly I was underwhelmed. A few years later, I tried thePlantronics Voyager 510 Bluetooth Headset [Retail Packaging], and it was amazing. For the most part, people can't tell that I'm on a Bluetooth headset!The Pros: Great audio quality! Good battery life.The cons: I only wish it had a better earpiece... on that really goes INTO my ears, like mySony MDR-XB20EX 9mm High Sensitivity Driver Extra Bass EX Earbuds. The volume and mute buttons are kinda small and hard to reach/press.Those are just small details though. Overall I am impressed.	7
Samsung has made a very attractive and slim slider phone with an incredibly vivid color LCD. This is probably one of the best slider phones on the market. The only complaint that I have is the keys on the main outer display are too flush and if you have larger fingers, then you will probably constantly hit the wrong buttons. Sound quality is excellent and will also depend on carrier reception. Speakerphone is very good and can be utilized with or without phone being opened. Overall, an excellent entry into the slider phone market by Samsung in a compact package.	7
Overall this headset is one of the best I have owned, and I own quite a few.  I have 3 different Jabras, a motorola, another plantronics, and various other off brands.  This headset is clear and since it fits directly in the ear, more than loud enough.  Pairing is a snap.  I am currently using it with my new Samsung a990.The only gripe, which isn't really anything serious is this. I wear the headset in my right ear.  While driving at night, the blinking of the device is extremely bright.  You can see it through the cabin of the vehicle.	7
Picked this up when it was on sale and I must admit that it works great. Fits well and stays put. Sound is crisp. I've received no complaints from people on the other end of the call. The battery holds up well. And it's easy to use. Used with an iPhone and Blackberry with no issues.Update: This headset has lastest quite a while with a lot of use. I sit on daily conferences, and this is always in my ear during the conferences. It's comfortable and lightweight. The sound is still great (on both ends). And no issues with durability!	7
All I really care about in a right-now-immediate way is calls.  Texts, and even weather emergencies can wait ten or fifteen minutes for me to check my phone again.  I have tiny wrists, and hate wearing stuff on my wrists anyway.  This I have on a lanyard when it's not in my ear, and it does the job perfectly (OK, I have a FitBit, too).  Vibrating with caller ID is all I *need.* I'm happy to wait out these first few (really) dry runs of smartwatches until Sony, Pebble, Samsung, Qualcomm, Apple (in 2018) and/or Martian finally get it right.	7
I carry many portable devices and sometimes I'm away from the office or home all day long. It's nice to have this charged and ready to go in case of emergencies. The charge capacity is great for it's size. It's perfect for my iPhone 5, 4G hot spot, and iPad. Probably not fully charging all three on one charge, but enough to last me the day. I don't use the laser pointer or the flashlight at all, though it's nice to know I have it in a pinch. I don't use it everyday. When I do need it, it's great.	7
Pro'sUnit has great range.Comfortable in the ears, can wear it all day.Battery life is awesome.Mute function make this very useful for someone that spends a lot of time on the conference calls.Con'sLasted two months and now will not turn on anymore. Trying to get motorola to fix it, but no help so far.Audio books may have issues. The headset will cut out during short pauses and makes you lose out on a few seconds of the story as it reconnects. Only certain books caused this behavior.If it did not quit on me I would certainly recommend it as a phone headset.	7
This battery is for my super old Moto V3 phone that I am using as secondary phone. this is my 3rd battery on the phone since i bought it many years ago. (wow the phone is still working) anyway, it gave 6-7 days of stand by time. I am using the phone to recive SMS only. I am not really using it for calling much now.But when I was using it actively for few weeks (after my primary phone broke down) it gave me solid 4.5 days of calling and texting time. Not bad... really... I can recomend this battery strongly.S.	7
I'll be quick.  Good idea here, poor engineering.  When it works it's wonderful, but it hits snags way too often.  I upgraded software as per customer service, it didn't help much.GPS is great when it works, but too often fails.Bluetooth stereo is great when it works, but too often it fails and devices have to be reset/repaired.I have to reboot an average of 4 times per week.One solid plus, the cell signal has been outstanding for me.  I can get a connection and complete a call when my friends can't.If the next iPhone has GPS I will probably eBay my Tilt.	7
My biggest surprise when moving to this headset was how good it sounds.  Call quality is as good as I've heard out of any headset, and this one is well above most others in its price range.  I would like the volume to go up a bit louder for noisier surroundings, but overall I think this is a great headset.  I especially like the little charging stand.  You just take the headset off, turn it off and drop it into the little magnetized cradle and voila, its charging.  No little tiny cords to push into little tiny holes like most headsets..	7
the freaking power cable quit working w/in a few weeks and neither t-mobile nor sony will fix it for less than $20.  Sony took my address and said they would, but it never showed up.Well the phone is rugged!  It's been 3-4 years and it still works.  It went through the washing machine and half the dryer.  It was submerged in a puddle for 30 minutes-  it keeeps working.The blue tooth syncs w/ my pc and tells me where to go etc.  I buy  a $25 access card every couple of months and avoid the taxes.  It's been a great little phone.	7
I bought two of these to help make keeping my otter box case on when needed to use the speaker/aux cable.The first cable worked for about 1 hour before it began to fray and separate.  The second one only gave audio out of one side.  You could pull the cable out slightly and get both channels (sides), but if your gizmo (phone, tablet, mp3 player) moves the slightest then it stops working on both sides.The other bad thing is the static it creates when in use (aux or headphones).The item is junk and I would avoid unless you like throwing away money.	7
I don't write many reviews, but the New Trent product line deserves a shout-out.A small, well-built battery charger that is reliable and powerful. Uses a standard 110 wall outlet to charge, and my Droid Razr was completely recharged almost 3  times.Comes with a USB cable for Droids and a cable for the Samsung Galaxy.The bells and whistles, i.e. the laser pointer and the LED flash, are handy.The bright blue 4 bar LED charge counter (lo, med, med-hi and full) allow you to check with a touch.I went with New Trent because I couldn't find a negative review, and I can see why.	7
I have an older computer with ony 4 usb ports and a laptop with 2 usb ports. I have 4  external drives and a printer and various other devices that require usb, and all i have to do is disconnect it from one computer and plug it into the other and everything Works great. As far as small flash drives that require external power i have no idea.  hope some reviewer will elaborate on that.  In any case its well worth the money.  It stays forever lit, and thats okay.  It will look funny 10 years from now when the lights are extinguished.	7
This is only my 2nd headset, and I much prefer it to the Motorola HS850.  It stays in your ear and has plenty of volume to overcome road noise in a car.  However, when my headset is on for extended periods, it sometimes experiences problems (will answer calls but not transfer them to the earpiece).  Turning headset off then on again fixes this problem.  Battery life and charge time seems excellent, but I don't have much to compare it to.  For those wanting to use it with your office phone also, the Plantronics bluetooth office phone adapter is EXPENSIVE ($200+ in Office Depot).	7
I purchased this bluetooth as a gift for a family member's Sony Ericsson cell phone.  We had to play around with it at first to get it working properly.  She still has minor issues with the headset, but overall she likes it.We decided not to return the headset because I did pair it with my iPhone 3G, after three attempts, without using the passcode.  I was able to use most features easily, with clear reception.  So the earpiece isn't defective.  The price was to good as well.Buyer beware, and do the research on the pairing capibilities with your electronic device and this bluetooth.	7
I bought this one 2 years ago, it still work well, battery life is good and I recharge it once a week, it can be charged on car too.Volume can be adjusted easily, I like chat with driving and it is a wonderful earphone.With a cable you can connect to your pc directly and listen to music too.In winter it is so wonderful, as it is a ear protection in a cold and windy morning:-)it is a little bit heavier at beginning, for man it is perfect, my daughters can not wear it without holding it.in one word, it is a good product.	7
I was real hesitant to buy this battery. But for the price, and convenience of free shipping, I cant say that I regret it.The battery looks good, there is no wires or anything out of place, and for the price how could you go wrong? I had to replace an old V3 battery that I used for overseas trips and never had an issue. Battery lasted longer than my original when I first bought it. Plus if you are getting better battery life and way cheaper battery why would you complain. Anyways, hope this review helps anyone setting on the fence like myself.	7
This little product is awesome !!I use it with my unlocked Nokia 95-3 and Nokia 800 Internet Tablet to charge them from my Apple MacBook. It charges even when it is in sleep mode.It is tiny and extremely convenient.The price is high, but for the convenience and function it provides it is worth it. I was not able to find any cheaper similar products offered by third parties. This is the real thing from Nokia.I now no longer need to carry any bulky, ugly, power bricks with me to keep charged up. All I need is this little gem. Very nice Nokia !	7
I am a woman who loves wearing men's levi's in this fit (or 555, 501, 565).  I had gastric bypass and just like how they hang and the weight/thickness of the jean material.  Most women's jeans are thinner, shallow pockets and have spandex, which I don't need.  I like the tighter fit, seems to keep everything tight.  And without the spandex, the jeans are warmer for the colder climes.  I've always been a levi's fan!!!	8
I bought this for my two-year-old.  He can't tell time, obviously, but he loves watches and wanted to wear one like Daddy.  It is so so cute.  The strap is completely adjustable, so I can pull it down to fit his tiny little wrist.  He will still be able to wear it when he is much older.  There isn't a second-hand; instead, two lizards go around the dial.  It is just precious and very sturdy too.	8
These shoes meet the requirement of my foot surgeon!  This is a very difficult task!  They are very comfortable on my feet, the look great and they are very safe!  I love these shoes!  This was a very good by for me!  I have worn them all around while traveling to the Grand Canyon!  Believe me there was a lot of walking to do!  I felt protected, safe, comfortable and attractive all in one!  Amazing shoes!  Thank you!	8
I L-O-V-E (LOVE) these briefs.  I sometimes have a hard time finding them in department stores so was very glad to be able to buy them on the Internet.  They are comfortable.  They allow a little forgiveness when you gain a bit here and there without stretching out if you lose a bit (I wish more often).  They also wash and wear very easily and simply.  I can even throw them in the dryer.  What's not to love?  :)	8
I almost returned these shoes, they're very light weight, almost too lightweight. It is only The hemp, no lining, no anything. The soles dont provide very good traction on wet/smooth surfaces. They 10 was a little big.BUTThey are very comfortable and look super cute with jeans. For running around on a nice day or walking around the city, they're pretty good.I don't hate them enough to return them, but don't love them enough to wear them all the time.	8
Thank you Halo Heaven great product for Little Girls.  My Great Grand Daughters Love these Tutu's.  Will buy more from this seller.  Made well and cute on the girls.  Thanks for a great product.NEVER BUY FROM DRESS UP DREAMS........I will buy more as long as I don't buy from &#34;Dress Up Dreams&#34;  I never rec'd or order in FL. Only rec'd pink, the purple one was missing.  Company is a rip off.  REFUSES to make good on purchase...... Real creeps.	8
These hold up and are a great value. They are also very pretty and flatter my not-the-best legs. I don't like wearing pantyhose but in a professional job they are still needed. That's my opinion, anyway. I have some great dresses and suits with skirts for work (yes, I am the consummate professional) and these are a necessary accessory. Is 'necessary accessory' an oxymoron?Thanks, Hanes. You make me thinner and more impressive.  How many products can honestly boast that?Marcianne Waters	8
Bought 3 one of these.  The watch is easy to see, has 3 alarms, and has nice colors.But, the bands are not replaceable (they stretch off the watch) and the lighter colored ones show dirt, and some of the dirt can't be cleaned off.  The band on 1st watch gave out after one year.  The 2nd watch didn't survive beginning open water diving (20 minutes at a maximum of 35'). The band on the 3rd watch lasted only two months.	8
I had one for a long trip to Israel.  Held my small camera, sunglasses, a few shekels, energy pills, and a bunch of small misc.  Darn if I didn't give it away 6 months after we returned home.  Tried other over the shoulder small bags but I missed this one for it's rugged look, perfect size and comfortable carrying.  Being made of canvas you can won't mind tossing it around or getting it dirty.  And, it is manly!  Send me another!	8
Ten years ago, my husband bought a pair of these Merrell shoes locally.  They were the most comfortable shoes he has ever worn.  Now (10 years later), after wearing these shoes on a daily basis, they have finally bit the dust.  We bought the same version from Amazon to replace his old Jungle Slip-on's, and the new ones are just as comfortable.  Out of the box, there's no break-in period needed -- he can wear them all day, with nary a blister.	8
"Great jacket! Very warm! I've only warn it a few times but it fits great.  I got a Tall size because I'm 6'5"" and I don't think I've ever had a jacket fit so well.  Looking forward to having this for the bitter Chicago winter.  It's stiff at first, but that's what you'll get with tough gear like this.  If you want something soft and fancy looking, go somewhere else (i.e. northface, columbia). This is definitely a tough jacket for tough guys!"	8
The fabric is the softest, and the thick lacy detailing is so sweet. This is my go-to black tank top. I wear it under nearly everything. The front does not sit as low on me as on the model, so it covers nicely. My last one was a hand-me-down which lasted several years, the new one I ordered to replace it is the same quality. I usually wear a medium/6 bottoms and large/8 on top, but in this I order/wear a MEDIUM.	8
I find this bra the first time I wear it is excellent, but then I wash it in the machine in a bag...and it seems to shrink in the cup!  I don't get that at all.  I]I'm a 38DD right now and losing weight, so for a cheap bra I can wear till I get down to a 36C this one will do.As the title says, not the worst, not the best...just ok.  And the 38DDD cup is just too big...I tried it.	8
I'm not sure what to think.  I have been searching for this color for a long time.  I finally found it and it wasn't $35, so I bought it.  It is a beautiful dark brown.  I got the right size.  The only thing is, I just don't like under wire bras.  I had hoped that it wouldn't be so bad, but alas, under wire is under wire, and it is annoying.  So, I will wear it, but not as often as I'd like.	8
these fit great.  I am 5'6&#34; 180.  problem is i wore them 3 or 4 times and two random spots started to &#34;pill up&#34;  one spot on my right &#34;cheek&#34; and the other on my left thigh.  i wore them to a normal job for about 6 hours. normal dress pants.  Amazon sent me a new pair.  will update after a couple weeks of wear and see what happens with new ones.  I really want these to work out, they fit feel great.	8
I bought these for my 13 yr old son.  They cost about the same price at the mall but it's always a plus when you can avoid going to the mall.  Chuck's run larger so you have to get a size smaller than what you would normally wear.  I found that out when I had to do a return and reorder.  Other than that, he seems to like his Chuck's.  I've bought a few more in different colors because he likes them so much.	8
I bought this bra not with sports in mind.  This is not a 'pretty, feminine' bra. As a large busted woman, I was tired of being disappointed with ill fitting bras. I needed the back/posture support and ample coverage.  This bra provides both--however the drawbacks are: 1)the straps are not long enough for me and 2) It gives you that 'minimizer bra' look. Nice wide straps and it provides cleavage coverage.  You may want to wear a tank or camisole with lower/open neck tops.	8
I got these as a gift for myself, great quality, sturdy, comfortable to wear, I don't even feel they're there! They're a bit bigger than I expected, maybe next time I'll go for the smaller thicker ones on offer here at Amazon (if they go on sale! hint hint!) Even with my long curly hair they show. I'm very satisfied.Update: More than a year later and these earrings are perfect, I even sleep with them. They get mega abuse and they're still going strong.	8
I've been trying to find a pair of trail running socks, but most everything I've seen or tested is at both ends of the spectrum - either too thick and tall, or too thin and short. Although they are called Hiking/Outdoor Socks, I would not consider them trail running. They are very comfortable due to thickness, but that's not what I want in a trail sock. Still, I can't fault them for hiking because they are quality made and feel good in hiking shoes/boots.	8
I lost my beloved Danskin Women's Mosai-Ix Crop Pants somewhere, and since they've been discontinued I decided to try another Danskin style.I bought these leggings in my usual size medium, and found them to be way too tight.  The material was thin and shiny, and they gave me an unflattering look in the crotch.  I expected them to be fitted, but not like pantyhose.  Maybe a large would fit better, but I wasn't all that happy with the material either.  I'm going to return them.	8
Compared to other dickies products in the same size, these overall's run a little more snug around the waist. I know they're intended more for work use, but i bought them as a sort of funky/quirky piece to wear around casually. I've got pretty normal proportions, but the legs felt like circus tents and the waist was slimmer than expected. I wanted to love these as they seemed like a fun idea, but unless you're looking to do some fitting modifications I'd say look elsewhere.	8
This is a great, amazing bag and sturdy, comfy, everything. The only problem with it is that it faded pretty quickly. I don't take it in the sun ever, not at all, but it did fade a lot. I don't know why. Anyway, this faded look would be just fine if I were a guy and could hang with a more rugged look, but I'm a female teacher and kind of think it looks grungy. I like the bag though and still use it sometimes.	8
These are my favorite t-shirts, great for lounging or for work (construction).  The material is the perfect weight...not too heavy, not too thin so no matter what the weather is, I'm comfortable in them. If it's a hot day, it doesn't cling to my skin and if it's a chilly day it layers well under a sweatshirt without bulking. I like how the material feels and that the collar area fits nice around the neck without any sagging.  They also wash and hold up well.	8
I think a color labeled &#34;Barely There&#34; should be much more neutral. I realize that if I had a dark tan or were of a different ethnicity perhaps these hose would look &#34;barely there&#34; on my legs. But as it is they remind me of the nylons I wore in junior high, colored &#34;Cinnamon.&#34; In fact I may send them back, I'm so disappointed. The shades depicted online are not at all representative. Cannot speak to fit or durability as I haven't tried them on yet.	8
"Just as beautiful as the photo, and provides great support! I did take the advice of other reviewers, and bought a size down (normally a 34C, and I bought a 32C). It fit great in that sense. However, I am a bit on the petite side (5' 2"") and the bottom of the torsolette kind of juts out--wouldn't look good under my wedding gown. I am returning it, but do recommend it if you have a slightly longer torso. I wish they made a petite size!"	8
I've had this bra for a few years now, and although it is supportive when I run (32DD), I find that it's my last choice and only wear it when my others are in the wash.  The main reason is that it's cotton, and I didn't really think about that when I first bought it.  It's fine in winter, but in the hot humid southern summers, it gets wet and stays that way.  Plus it catches on some shirts because of the fabric not being smooth.	8
I'm accustomed to push up bras because of my lack of endowment, so this was definitely something different. Straps are nice and thick. Back band is wide. Front portion lays flat underneath bra instead of tilting up. Cups themselves are two layers of lace that support nicely but do not form the breast as a padded bra might. Will not hide *ahem* signs of 'cold weather'. Middle portion does tend to press into the chest. My boyfriend will love it when he gets back from the holidays.	8
I like the look of this watch very much, but 3 problems:  1) the band is relatively short, and 2) the straps to hold the band down (2) disintegrated after about 2 months, and 3) while the watch is waterproof, using it while swimming fewer than 6 times has resulted a faded and worn looking watch band. I'd buy it again if the band could be longer and there could be a more durable or perhaps a metal bracket to hold down the end of the band.	8
I purchased this for my husband as a gift.  He says it's the best thing he's ever gotten.  He loves the space inside and the separate compartments.  Since he works in 48-hour shifts, he uses it every single day.  He said that the rubber bumpers on the bottom of the bag are perfect for keeping the leather out of counter messes both at work and at home, and that he is able to fit all of his daily bathroom supplies inside with room to spare.  Great quality!	8
My boyfriend works outdoors (trims/cuts trees under the powerlines in Northern Wisconsin) and it gets quite cold in the winter. He had been wearing good old fashioned long johns when I bought him these for his birthday. They are all he wears now, instead of 2 pairs of long johns. He loves them and I love not having to wash 10 pairs of long johns. I also have a similar pair (women's though) and they are incredible .Not too bulky but very warm in the winter months.	8
Tried on my boots as soon as I got em and although they were a tiny bit tight at first, I'm now wishing I'd gotten a half size smaller.  I have a wide foot, but these break in easy. And fit my wide foot even though they're a B width!  They just seem a hair too long.  Love the stitching on the upper half.  Like how they feel..I'm hoping they have enough arch support for when I wear them all day.  All in all a quality boot!	8
These shoes are true to size, are authentic converse, are comfortable, and arrived on time and in the correct color.  My only complaint about converse is that they are a bit too narrow. However you can find them at pretty much any shoe store so you can always try them on first before you buy them.  I am happy about the price too (they were $10 more expensive at DSW than here on amazon).  They don't offer much in terms of arch support, but overall I can't complain.	8
Bali Skimp Scamp Briefs are THE MOST COMFORTABLE UNDERWEAR I have ever worn in my 64 YRS. of life!! They are very Soft and Silky with a back seam instead of side seams. These briefs NEVER, EVER Ride up or get stuck (you know where), they ALWAYS Stay in Place, my clothes glide over them very easily and there's No visible Panty line either!! I would rather go without than wear any other under garment!! Try 'em, You'll LOVE 'em too!! You'll Never be Sorry with this purchase.	8
My husband is extremely picky and hard to please.  He needed new jeans but has been disapointed with the quality of Levi's brand.  I knew Carhartt makes tough work clothes and outerwear that lasts, so I asked him to try these.  I bought 2 pair and awaited delivery.  My husband loves them.  They fit perfectly in the waist and length.  I have washed them since purchase and they have not shrunk or faded.  I plan to buy more when I need to from Carhartt since he is happy.	8
"UPDATE  I've owned these earrings for 7 years.  I wear them often and they look as good as the day they arrived from Amazon in 2007.  Perfect 14K yellow gold color, not brassy-looking at all like some gold is, they are the perfect size - 1"" in diameter.  Well made, yet light in gram weight, the post snaps shut with a nice click and doesn't feel like they will easily come unsnapped.  The hinge seems to be high-quality and strong too.  They are the perfect earring for me."	8
Great pants. Perfect fit.Wrinkle freeStain resistant. What more could you want?I don't know how other people are getting too big or small pants. I have ordered Silver, Khaki, and Black. They are a perfect fit. I always order a size bigger just in case they shrink after washing. I will update if any changes after washing. I would give this a 5 star but I don't like the clasp closure, I'd rather have a button. But Dickies does not have 34x29L pants with a button closure.Thank you amazon.	8
This waist cincher is perfect for those who don't have a whole lot to pack in, but want a smooth, long line.  I also like it because the garter straps can be significantly shortened, so the tops of my stockings are not down near my knees at the end of the day.  It is comfortable but sturdy - no weird poking or pinching - and it holds its shape throughout the day.  Finally, this is much more visually appealing than most waist cinchers/tummy flatteners out there.  Highly recommended.	8
I like the Keen concept, but they are cheaply built and unacceptable as a beach sandal.  I have the black model and they have turned a dark purple.  The sun or salt water may have caused the change.  I wore them everyday during my Culebra vacation.  The shoes are not sturdy enough to use on a gravel beach.  When I hiked a rocky path, I had to be careful or I would twist my ankle.  My companion wore Teva sandals they proved to be a better casual sandal.	8
First impression out of the package - a really awful smell.  Maybe that's the cedar part, I don't know.  At any rate, it does what it's supposed to - maintain the shape of the shoe, though the springs seem fairly weak.  I'll try and say more about it after some time goes by.I've had it a while yet; now I can say that the straps are too small and too scrawny, and hard to use to remove or insert the shoe trees.  I'd greatly prefer a real handle.	8
This ear cuff certainly looks great, whether worn low as pictured or higher up. And it's very easy to put on. Which means it's very easy to take off... or, rather, come off when you don't want it to (say, for instance when you're sleeping or brushing your hair). I adjusted the tightness with pliers after putting it on, thinking that would get it to stay put; it helped, but didn't solve the problem  entirely. Bottom line, it's a fun and attractive accessory - it just has limits.	8
My daughter had one of these when she was a toddler. It was really sweet and she loved carrying it around and taking the stuff out. I ended up buying one for my step-grandaughter this Christmas. She was thrilled with it and just like my daughter used to do, she had a blast pulling everything out, going through it and putting it all back in. Everything is easy to hold, fun to look at, and just grown-up enough to make them feel like this really is their own purse.	8
I've purchased the 3mm, 4mm, 5mm & 6mm sizes.  I was happy with all, but not with this 6mm size.  These are from a different manufacturer/supplier, Leach and Garner.  While they look good, the posts are too short and very slippery, also the backs don't stay on tight, slipping off very, very easily.  I have thin to average ear lobes, but found I couldn't wear these without them falling off (potentially, getting lost).  Otherwise, they would have been fine.  I returned them and would not buy this pair again.	8
I've had this watch for several months now and I really like it. The second hand is nice for timing things, and it is very easy to read the time. It's also very simple so it doesn't compete with other jewelery. However, as other reviews stated, this watch is VERY small. My writs are almost exactly 6 inches around and I wear this watch on the third-largest size, so it definitely wouldn't go more than ~6.5 inches around your wrist. Other than that, it's very nice, delicate, and simple.	8
"I'm pale skinned with pink undertones. I ordered ""barely there"", (the title next to a light shade of hosiery) and if by ""barely there"" they mean ""VERY OBVIOUSLY there"", then they've really nailed it with their subtley sarcastic description.These hose were brown, like a dark taupe. The photo clearly shows a lighter shade. So, anyway, the point of this review is, if your skin tone is like mine, don't make the same mistake I did by assuming the shades shown represented how these hose *actually* look in real life."	8
The idea is that you can take a couple pairs of these and wear one while you wash the other in a sink, minimizing the underwear you have to bring on a trip. The problem is that they don't feel that comfortable. There is little to not support, and they feel sort of scratchy on my skin. I always know they are there.Underwear doesn't take that much space so when packing it isn't a problem to take a few extra, and honestly my Under Armour does not wash inferiorly.	8
I previously purchased this identical shoe in a different color (brown).  I was a very durable and well fiting shoe.  Although they are supposed to be the exact same shoe, the black one fits a bit higher at the top of the back of the ankle and rubs a bit while wlaking. It is irritating to walk a long distance.  I've worn them several times and I am still waiting (hoping) for them to break in.  I think these shoes may be made by different suppliers, in different countries.	8
These are a must in humid climates. I ordered some long sleeve ones too. There are lots of pockets on the chest so it &#34;looks&#34; very much so like a fishing shirt. If that is okay, then you are fine.  Columbia makes some others that have less or different pocket style.  My Tamiami II long sleeve one has better pocket designs.  Color is a big factor in cost which is weird, but price can vary as much as $10-12 per shirt based on color despite Amazon being the seller.	8
These shoes shipped fast and fit perfect. I needed work shoes to wear during 12 hour shifts in an ER. These are awesome for that. They support my feet and they do not rub my toes raw. They are also easy to put on and pull off. They are not the best looking shoes though. My wife makes fun of them all the time on me but I don't care. They feel amazing. Perfect shoes for work but I would not wear them out in town or on date night.	8
"The quality of Levis jeans seems to be a decline, an endless abyss. The back label, which supposedly should be leather, cardboard seems now. The jeans manufactured in Mexico and Egypt are the worst labels or at least, in my experience, has been. I think there should be more oversight by Levis in its factories around the world. Previously, a Levis jeans was a piece ""almost perfect"", today I can not say the same. I totally agree with all the people who are disappointed with diminishing quality of these jeans."	8
This is a &#34;sleep leisure&#34; bra, so I wasn't expecting a push-up, but it might be a little too comfortable and relaxed with the fit if you've got a large chest. Also, I absolutely know my bra size and ordered this in my correct size and it was WAY small. I returned and ordered the next size up and it was actually still a bit snug, but workable. I'd take that into consideration when buying and, if you are busty like me, you might want to go a different direction.	8
I wanted something that I could wear around the house on those &#34;just want to be comfy&#34; days.  This bra fits the bill.  I wear a 36DD and went with the 38D/D/DD size.  The cups fit good and do not cause a uniboob like a lot of bras like this cause.  However, the band was a bit snug on me.  When I reordered a couple more I went with the 40C/D/DD and like that fit much better.  I would say this is the next most comfortable thing to bra-less :-)	8
I don't like that the different styles are made in different locations so you never really get a consistent make or wear with Levi's anymore.  This particular &#34;lot or batch&#34;  was good.  However, they seem to be thinner than usual.  Not really sure if that a new thing.  They have 7 belt loops.  Some poor reviews stated they had 5.  This again may be a consequence of multiple manufacturing facilities.Overall, basic Levi quality with expected characteristics.  Price is more reasonable online than most store retailers.  I think this offsets risks.	8
I love the look of these shoes and was so hoping the fit would be great...not so. I ordered a (92A) and the left shoe wasso long, couldn't believe it; the right shoe fit great. So I decided to order a 81/2(2A)...just received them. I couldn't believe it--they don't fit either...left shoe still too long & too wide and right shoe doesn't fit--too wide.I have trouble finding narrow shoes that are affordable and attractive so am very disappointed. I'm wondering if there wasa problem in production and therefore were cheaper???	8
"great bra, runs big in  the cups....I am small in the back, but, this, the cups not for me anywayHad to return mine, even though I did try it on in a hurry, purchased the bra, and had to return both...I am a 36 DD, very nice, cups run big.  I am a 36 DD in all bras, this one, not to good.....Fav bras, Bali new ""comfort bra"" awesome, Bali ""t back bra"", Gap,"" full coverage lace"", and my very fav. ""Champion everday bra"", wonderful, perfect fitting in each styleSo beware...."	8
We wanted the costume that didn't have all the bulk in it.  This was perfect.  My son is 4 and it was a little big, but I just think- hey, he can wear it to play in for a good year or so.  He'll get lots of wear out of this.  It would be nice if the boot covers fit tighter, but they were good enough! Easy on and off...we actually had a whole outfit on under it to keep warm, so there's your muscle bulk, if that's what you want.	8
I have very narrow shoulders so my bra straps constantly need hiking up. Many years ago, I finally found a Wacoal that stays put but it no longer fits and is being discontinued. I have tried every single other brand on the planet and they all slip off so I got this to hold them in place. It works perfect. I wish I didn't have the extra bump across my back but it's better than constantly reaching in my shirt to pull up slipping straps. I like that it is adjustable, too.	8
I was ordering a wrist watch for my nephew and somehow, this product popped up.  As it looked similar to the watch that I was about to place in my shopping cart, I placed this one in the shopping cart, and did not pay attention to what I was buying.  When I received it, I contacted Amazon and received an immediate return authorization label.  I sent it back on Monday December 16, 2013 and have received my refund credit already on Tuesday December 17, 2013.  Great product.....just clicked on the wrong one.	8
Be sure to go up in size. Anyone who wears Dickies apparently knows this. I looked at my man's pants to order him new ones, and there was no size that I could find on the old ones. So I ordered his normal pants size. Way too small. So I sent it  back and went up 2 sizes, and that was too big. Should have ordered one size up. Know your Dickies size and write it down!The fabric is stiff and sturdy, almost indestructible, does not lose its color in the wash.	8
The more I wear it, the more I love it.  It's so comfortable.  I'm not constantly messing with the straps and tugging on it because I'm about to fall out of it.  This bra fits really well.  The minute I put it on, I can stop thinking about it for the rest of the day.  The straps stay put and don't dig in to my shoulders.  Plus, I love not having to worry about the straps showing.  Fits true to size and fits well.  Good support.  Have all three colors now.  :)	8
Definitely high quality. These shoe trees sell as a pair. Two in the box.Spring loaded with a split instep. Force them into the toe of your boot/shoe and push the heel home. The instep widens to mold to the shape of the instep and toe of your footwear and the spring mechanism pushes back against the heel.These trees will break your toughest footwear in within a week.Perfect form and fit, very functional and priced right.I feel safe claiming the mechanics and the form will last a lifetime.I'm very happy with my purchase.	8
Purchased this to wear under a formal dress for a wedding.  The control and slimming aspects are outstanding; really made my dress hang well.  Unfortunately, every time I sat down, the bottom would ride up so once I stood again I would need to slip into the ladies' room to pull it back down.  I avoided anything with a seat because it becomes so cumbersome to go to the bathroom and thought this would be a good alternative but it was not.  I would buy a Ragu product again just not this style.	8
I'm really impressed with these shimmers pantyhose tights . They're warm and durable like tights but have a really sexy semi sheer, shimmery look to them like luxury pantyhose. .Great to wear with a mini and heels to really show off  your legs and they'll still keep you  warm.They  fit fantastic and are very comfortable to wear for long days.They also give your legs support,  feels like you wearing leggs sheer energy pantyhose . I've  tried a lot of  tights and these are one of the best and the price is reasonable.Love them!	8
I actually take an E width in a shoe but decided to try these in the 9.5D.  They are a little tight across the top of foot which was expected as even EE boots are tight there.  I will use a form stretcher at the spot and they will feel fine.  I found these on a closeout at a fantastic price via Wholesale Deals so could not pass them up.  GREAT SHOE at a GREAT PRICE!  On top of this they were received within three days.  &#34;THANKS AGAIN AMAZON&#34; for a great deal.	8
I was delighted with this watch when it came.  The black dial is very good looking  and easy to read. Adjusting the wrist band was more complicated than I had hoped for but I was able to do so with some help.  I would have given this watch a 5-star review but it stopped working after two days. I hope it only needs a battery because I love the watch and don't want to return it. 2/15 A  new battery worked for a few days than stopped. I reluctantly returned for a refund.	8
This bra looks very nice; I got both the black and the toast. Issue here is I wonder how long they will hold up. They have a type of 't-shirt material' feel; and aren't the sturdiest. For the price, I was expecting much higher quality. Time will tell if they hold up or fall apart! Not impressed with the quality but they are comfortable. Not sure if I recommend; due to my conflicting thoughts on them. I do think you can get a better quality bra for a lower price here on Amazon...	8
I love Hanes Silk Reflections pantyhose and thigh highs, I have been wearing them for about 15 years.  They look and feel good on my legs and under my clothes.  They are very sheer and sexy.  I can wear them all day and they do not bag or sag at the knees or ankles.  They are also very durable, I usually get 5 or more wearings out of every pair.I used my Amazon Prime membership for the shipping and received free 2 day shipping.  The packages arrived on time and in good shape.	8
"i absolutely love these shirts for work and for play. i am 5'10"" 185lbs and on the muscular/beefy side and i wear a medium. everything else in the world, i wear a large. even the t shirt under my Dickies shirt (that i am wearing as we speak) is a large. i never need to iron these shirts and they look great and hold up well for the ship work, construction work, and office work that i do. if Dickies could get their sizing more consistent i would buy more of their products."	8
My wife has been through three of these watches. She loves the functions of the watch for work, but the bands keep breaking. So far, googling hasn't shown a source for replacing the watch bands.It shouldn't be too difficult. The watch body itself just pops right out of the rubbery band. Given the tremendous amount of bands that are breaking, I'm surprised that someone over in China hasn't started making a living from selling replacement bands. But even eBay doesn't have anything.I'm wondering if we can find a craftsman to fabricate an alternative?	8
I would imagine anything made of 100% cotton is liable to shrink, common sense will tell you that.  To reduce shrinkage, wash in cold water only and dry at lowest heat setting in your dryer, better yet, dry outdoors on a clothes line.  I have to wear the black colored ones for work and so far after multiple washing, no fade in the color.I take size Medium and when I bought them they looked awfully big, but after the first washing, they fit perfectly.  I do think Hanes allows for the shrinkage.Highly Recommended	8
I purchased this armoire based on the positive comments from other buyers. I was very disappointed at the very cheap quality of the drawers. When you pull them out far enough to have a glimse of the items in the back compartments, the drawer just falls out. If you ever want to see items stored towards the back of the drawers you will have to pull the drawer out entirely. Very cheap workmanship. Not worth it. If you are a prospective buyer, I'd go for one of the more expensive and durable models.	8
For a long long time I have wanted a pair of these in pink. I think years ago these were made only for males because my brothers had them. From time to time I have seen them but never in pink. Well finally pink and I jumped on them as soon as I saw them. I have worn them and got some really nice compliments. I am a &#34;young&#34; senior and I wore these with my crop jeans and with my long jeans folded up and they really look great! I am a fashionista!	8
Here's what I wanted and got:Slimming torsoEasy to put onFlatters in every dress I tried on with itAppropriate push up for my boobsI normally wear a 34E but I got tired of the cups covering my entire boob which made them look like C's.  I wanted a slimmimg push up effect but not too much because I am already endowed.  This does it!Cons:There is a tiny bit of boob that drops under the underwire.  Not at all a big deal for me because it's not uncomfortable and it's unnoticeable when Iwear tighter fitting dresses.	8
This is a beautiful watch, nicer in person than the picture.  I love the two tone look to wear with gold and silver jewellery.  I agree with other reviews that the second hand is too prominent and gets mistaken for the minute hand, but this is something you get used to after a while, I've been wearing it for about a month now.  it keeps perfect time so far and the face is medium size and suits my wrist (medium to large).  Very sleek and classic looking, can wear to work or going out.	8
These earrings are cute, and appropriate for the price the seller is charging.  I agree with someone who posted earlier that the flat back of the earrings sometimes shows (particularly true if you have short hair).  The good news is that the backs of the earrings aren't ugly or anything.  Just flat and not pretty.  I, too, wish the earrings had been designed more solidly (and more three-dimensional), but for this price, what can you expect?  They are pretty, and they are a nice length.  They are a little delicate, but not really fragile.	8
I just got them and they are actually lighter than I expected.  It was like slipping a glove on.  They feel great.I will start breaking them in tomorrow, but It is not going to take a lot of time.  They are super.  I have a wide foot with a high instep.  No problems there.  I have had Vasque and a couple others.  I love my Vasque from 1972, but they seemed to have slipped in the styling and manufacturing.  These look rugged and feel like slippers.  We'll see in the next couple of days.	8
Soft and really light.  Works really well and is very well thought out with 2 zippered pockets and an large Velcro pouch with 2 separate pockets.  I find this a very good arrangement.  Money in one zippered pocket and card and license in the other and the cell phone in the Velcro pocket. I also like the adjustment on the length of cord so you can wear it high or lower.  Not my everyday wallet as a full size Spec Op but this is great for days when more security is need or no pockets.	8
My 11-year old daughter is 5' 2&#34; and weighs 103 lbs.  She's straight as a board and doesn't have much of a butt.  However, these size 4 fit her very well.  I was concerned, since I ordered online and couldn't hold them up to put my eyes on them before I bought them.  She really likes the prints and when she tried them on she said they felt more like a bathing suit bottom.  That's good, since bathing suits need to fit your body kind of tight.  They're Jockey, so they're made of great quality!	8
I like the shoes, a lot.  The only issue I have is the top, instep is very snug.  It is making my foot sore.  I think it will loosen up a little, so for now I am only wearing the shoes part time.  I needed these to wear in the house, for some support while I am doing my normal house chores, so I just take them off for a bit, then go back to them later.  I hope they loosen up, I really like New Balance shoes, have been purchasing this brand for years.	8
These pants are very well made and durable.  The stitching is strong, and well-aligned.  The extra side pockets are sized just right for my phone, as I don&#8217;t like putting my phone in the other pockets.  The size is spot on, while the darker color is very nice.  These jeans also have seven belt loops; other brands only have six.  The pockets are extra deep.  The waist is slightly taller than other jeans I have; that is the button is higher up my waist than others, but it is not uncomfortable.  Overall, very impressive jeans.	8
I use these in my cowboy boots and they have done a wonderful job of keeping the toes from curling up with infrequent use. All of my boots are exotics and require dressing to be applied quite frequently. With these in place the task becomes a joy instead of a chore. I am going to buy many more pairs! By the way they fit perfectly and are very easy to put in or take out. I use my boot jack hooks to remove them as my arthritic fingers are no longer up to the task.	8
Both my husband and I wanted a navy blue sweatshirt but the colors were picked over after Xmas. Hanes had the navy in our sizes so we decided to try them out since my husband has worn the underwear with no problem. Well these have the strangest sizing imaginable. Body was too large yet short and the neck was so small you could barely get it over your head. If I'd only ordered one I'd have thought it was just that one but both sizes had the same issues. Buyer beware!!!!! Stick to their underwear.	8
Love these, bought them in this color and black. Only problem is that I'm fair-skinned and this light toast color is like Malibu tan, which might work in the summer. They hide any spider veins or light/small discolorations well. The shimmer is nice, kind of understated. See my review about the ultra shimmery footed tight in black for issues regarding feet slipping in shoes after these are put on, because it's important to know.I will order these in the lighter skin tone, as they might be a better match for me to wear year round.	8
I ordered this wallet on a Friday, and I received it the following Tuesday, and it is BEAUTIFUL. I ordered the red one, because red is my favorite color. It is VERY nicely made. Very roomy, has LOTS of places to carry cards etc. The leather is nice and soft to the touch. I think that I am going to be VERY pleased with this wallet for years to come. It also came in a very nice box, so that if anyone were getting it for a gift for someone it would be easy to wrap.	8
I was able to fit my 120lb ex in this bag (Just so we are clear it was when we were dating, I didn't kill her or anything). I use it to store a memroy foam mattress for transport to my college apt. This is a big and durable bag I have loaded lots into before and dragged to my car (Again...it was not a body). The zipper and bag seem pretty stout and have held up for me so far. A strap would be a nice addition if I had anything to gripe about it.	8
My husband purchased these for me to match a white gold necklace.  I wear them 95% of the time.  I sleep in them.  They are very small, but that's what I like about them.  They're dainty.  The latch is still working well, even though I shower in them and sleep in them.  I change them rarely, as they match the necklace which is sentimental to me.  I had meant to get some more white gold earrings and just haven't.  These have stood the test of time... even though I didn't mean to challenge them that way.	8
This was a great tool for teaching my children how to tell time.  Too many kids can only read digital numbers; you give them an analog watch or clock and they're lost.  I bought this for my five year old son.  He learned very quickly how to tell time on it.  He wore it 24 hours a day in the pool, sledding, running and playing. The lens got pretty scratched up and the wrist band stretched some, but it was a great watch... until he lost it.  I would strongly recommend this watch for young children.	8
I am skeptic about buying cloths online but I thout I will give a try. And I am not disappointed .I just got my bra today. The bra made really nicely,fits perfectly and gives a really good support. I got this bra for sleep in and I can't wait to use it for this purpose. It is a great bra for a great price.Update: after wash and wearing for a couple times bra cups got misshaped. Looks weird - half empty. My guess they run size bigger .If I could I would take off a star.	8
I used these for hiking and I didn't want anything too heavy or bulky so these were just what I wanted.  I wear a lighter pair of wicking socks under these.  They fit nicely, had plenty of stretch and were nice and soft.  They dried quickly when I removed my hiking boots.  I am very please with this purchase.  I keep an extra pair in my pack if needed.  I hiked 10 miles up and down Mt. Katahdin with no blisters or anything so I have to say these socks did the trick to the max.Tom	8
I bought one of these waist cinchers and its very effective and not too uncomfortable.  An added benefit is that it helps me to remember to sit up straight.  It works well for me, its not the easiest piece of clothing to put on because of each individual hook and eye but once on it stays in place and does its job perfectly. I'm a bit short so this rides a little higher and lower on my than in the picture but that's exactly where I need the support!  SB 5 foot 4 and 140 lbs	8
I wear these shirts for my job (they are given to us, and must be tucked in when worn) and I would love to meet the person who decided these were long enough to be tucked in and that the enormous fit around the stomach area was appropriate. They come untucked way too easily and the bunched up look in the waist when tucked in is unavoidable unless you're very fat... it looks sloppy.If they made these in a slimmer fit or athletic fit and with a longer tail I would buy a lot of them.	8
I used this bag alot and was quite rough with it, eventually the stitching starting coming apart because I would carry heavy and sharp edge objects, (books mostly) and it would jump around a lot so I stressed the straps a lot. It's lasted me a long long time and will buy another one because it's so quintessential and the canvas is good quality.On another note for those men who are concerned about being notarized as a, &#34;dude who carries a &#34;man purse&#34; I say whooooo cares! It's not like it's colored pink for goodness sake!	8
What a gorgeous nightgown this was.  It fit beautifully and was so feminine and lovely. Unfortunately, it was misadvertised under cotton nightgowns, but it was nylon, and nylon doesn't breathe and is hot to sleep in.  I reluctantly sent it back, knowing I'd roast in it at night. It was sold by an outside merchant who charges a restocking fee, and arm wrestles you a little about it. So from now on, I'm only going to buy straight from Amazon, where they don't hastle you on returns and refund the whole amount, and pay the postage.	8
These were great for my son's halloween costume.  Looks fantastic.  They are inflatable - I don't know if you can tell that from the picture.  You have to get them really inflated in order for the wings to stick out straight like they should.  My chief complaint is how the straps (very thin 1/4&#34; elastic) are attached to the jet pack.  It looks like they will break loose any moment.  Mine survived a halloween party and halloween itself, but I don't expect this to stand up to much more.  It did look great with the costume, though!!!	8
I keep buying both the low profile and high top versions for my son as he grows, and he loves them. The shoe fits nice, has a good flexible sole for running on both pavement and grass, so for a toddler, that is a plus. Also, he can wear them all day, and is comfortable. I think the fabric is good for developing feet that need to stretch, but still give enough support. He likes these way better than the Saucony's I bought him, which seemed to never break in, and were a bear to put on.	8
This is my second garter from Rago and it's amazing. If you're looking for shapewear, this is the brand you want. Don't bother with Spanx, they're not gonna hold you in. They'll smooth all the lines, but this one will give you the firmed up, 1950s look. I work at a 1950s clothing shop and I'm not the only girl who wears Rago!Also, I'm a petite girl and Rago has sizes for me. Shapewear in smaller sizes can be difficult to come across.Anyway, Rago is an amazing brand, please don't hesitate to get something from them. &#60;3	8
I must like these shoes, this is my fourth pair, and they're all still in use. I discovered Merrell's hiking shoes maybe 10-12 years ago, and always found them to be well made, durable and comfortable. The jungle mocs continue the tradition, and add the convenience of being a slip-on. This makes them my go-to shoes for a run out to the mailbox, for any activity that involves walking, yard work (the oldest pair), etc. They are also good looking enough for business casual wear at the office, going well with khakis or jeans on casual Friday.	8
The ball earrings are beautiful and I was very disappointed to find that the posts are so short, what you would expect to find on earrings for a small child.  The posts were also thin, but that was okay.  Also, the tension backs were so tiny, I had a hard time handling them.  If I had purchased them for the Jan 2007 price, I might have kept them and had new posts and backs put on by my local jeweler.  The photo shows the posts and backs to be more substantial.  Sadly, I have to return them.	8
I wear a 36 H now that I am nursing, and the medium ++ fits perfect. This is by far my most comfortable nursing bra. I wear it around the house, while sleeping, running errands, and even playing racquetball. The fit is like a sports bra (it does create a &#34;uniboob&#34; look) but it has great support.  If you are looking for a nursing bra for busty women with better shaping for going to work or dressing-up, I recommend the Bravado Bliss Nursing Bra, but definitely buy a Double Plus (or a few) for your days off.	8
These are pretty good.  They're definitely better than Fruit of the Loom brand boxer-briefs.  There's a little bit more pouch in the front of these, which helps support everything while moving around.They breathe well and feel well ventilated and cool, even at the end of the day.Unfortunately, the elastic/lycra/spandex/whatever content is low enough that these will stretch out throughout the day.  Support and fit decrease, and waistband rolls up by the end of the day.Overall, I rate these 4 of 5 stars.X-Bionic brand hold their shape better throughout the day, but don't cool as well as these.	8
Gloria Vanderbilt &#34;Amanda&#34; jeans have been my favorite for a very long time.  I've recently lost some weight and instead of women's sizes am now in misses sizes. I wondered if that would make a difference, but I'm still satisfied with the sizing and fit. It's nice to know you can order a style and size and be reasonably sure of satisfaction.  I do so dislike having to return items. They also are of good quality.  In the past, I've had Amanda jeans for years, laundering them about once a week.  They really wear well and last.	8
"The Click have been under-rated and overlooked for years, and probably always will be.  Despite that, they've managed to put out better sh** than 90% of rappers out there.  ""Game Related"" is a must have for any west coast fan, and any rap fan in general should at least check it out.  My personal fav tracks are ""Hurricane"", ""Out My Body"", ""We Don't F*ck wit Dat"", ""Scandalous"", & ""Learn About It"".  Peace"	9
I don't know of a more beautiful song than Lisa Loeb's 'How'.  It is perfect, brilliant and captivating.  I love every inch of it.  &quot;Firecracker&quot; is Lisa's second album and it does a great job.  Some of the songs I don't see fit for this album but most of the songs do the CD justice.  I love Lisa's vocals and acoustic sound.  The opener 'I Do' is also an amazing song, especially for an opener.	9
ATLiens, in my opinion, is a better CD thanSouthernplayalisticadillacmuzik.  Both are definite hip hop classics, but I have this draw to ATLiens.  I can't explain what it is.The CD is very different from the first.  Where the first was built around the gangster concept, this CD builds its own concept.  One I have yet to put a name to.My favorite songs include Two Dope Boys, ATLiens, Jazzy Belle, Elevators, Babylon, Millenium, and Extra-Terrestrial.Definite Must Have.	9
"This,is the type(and caliber)of album that is(sadly)missing,from todays(pathetic)music scene!!""Foolin'Around""became an INSTANT classic,""Good Thing""is a painfully TRUE,song,and ""All is not gone""is a beautiful,HOPE-instilling track!! The entire,album is good,but these three songs,are the CREAM of the crop!! I miss,the days,when women,such as these,were APPRECIATED,for creating thought-provoking beautifully sung ballads,INSTEAD of being lauded,for marketing,sex-appeal!! Oh,well,I can always pop this ""gem""into my player,whenever,I'm craving quality musical offerings!!As it is,I'm going to be playing the surfacing,OFF,of this disc,in the following weeks!!"	9
"This CD is definetely a must own for any Misfits fan/fiend/whatever. Released in 1997, this CD features classics such as ""Dig Up Her Bones"", ""Mars Attacks"", ""Shining"", and ""Black Light"". Okay, so Michale Graves' can't sing as well as Danzig. But, hey. Not many Punk vocalists can sing better than Danzig. Michale's aggressive howls and cries sound well blended in with sharply-tuned guitars and bass. The drums are also decent. Pick this one up along with Famous Monsters."	9
"Although vocalists Kym Mazelle, Victoria Wilson-James, Lamya, and Marcia Lewis perform well on their respective solos, the powerhouse performances of Caron Wheeler from the group's first album drops this recording down a few notches.With that in mind, the instrumental selections are clearly the better offerings here: ""Time (Untitled)"" and ""Courtney Blows"", are jazzy enough not to be pop and pop enough not to be jazz.That is Soul II Soul's contribution to the music industry: being something for everyone."	9
A good collection of Olivia's classic pop songs, along with 4 newly recorded ones. &quot;Deeper than a river&quot; is a Diane Warren song, not a bad song, but I don't think it's one of Diane's best. The rest of the songs are culled from 8 of Olivia's previous albums.  Of the new songs, my favourite is &quot;I want to be wanted&quot;...a lovely ballad. It's too bad her comeback didn't happen as expected, but at least we have this album.	9
This could arguably be the best Wu-Tang solo album.  Once again, the RZA lays down his amazing beats for his fellow Clan-mate to glide over.  The GZA, who is probably the Clan's most gifted MC, drops jewels throughout this album (peep &quot;Labels&quot;).  This is my second favorite Wu-Tang album behind &quot;Only built 4 Cuban Linx&quot;.  Also, his second Wu album was O.K., but the &quot;Legend of The Liquid Sword&quot; is hot too.  As far as this CD goes, certified classic.	9
I think Neneh Cherry is underrated. Certainly underappreciated. Since  1989's &quot;Buffalo Stance&quot;, &quot;Kisses on the Wind&quot; and  &quot;Heart&quot;, Neneh Cherry has been mainly forgotten in America. I  think 1992's Homebrew is the best of her three cds. It has great songs like  &quot;Buddy X&quot;, &quot;Peace in Mind&quot;, &quot;Red Paint&quot;,  &quot;Move With Me&quot;, &quot;Trout&quot;, &quot;Ain't Gone Under  Yet&quot; and &quot;Money Love.&quot; This is a great hip-hop/r&amp;b cd  that was generally overlooked by the public. A must have for any rock  collector.	9
"""Great Radio Controversy"" (1989) #18.Great hard rock music here, and a few nice peer ballads, there's plenty of meat and potatoes on this disc.  ""Hang Tough"" # 34 MSR, ""Heaven's Trail (No Way Out)"" #13 MSR, ""Lazy Days, Crazy Nights"", ""Did It For Money"", ""The Way It Is"" #55 hot 100 and #13 MSR, the ultimate classic ""Love Song"" #10 hot 100 and #7 MSR and ""Party's Over"".  Best Tesla album of theirs on the market.  Due for a re-master.  Out."	9
This has the best of the singles Diana released in the 70's and early 80's.  My favorite tracks are &quot;I'm Coming Out&quot; and &quot;Upside Down&quot;.  They are timeless dance tracks that will always get you  moving.  I think they are the best thing Diana did after leaving the  Supremes.  &quot;Theme From Mahogany&quot; and &quot;Touch Me In The  Morning&quot; haven't stood the test of time as well but are always a joy  to hear and are my favorite ballads on the album.	9
So many good songs on this one! Try tracks 1, 3, 7, 9, 10, 14. Whether they're doing punk or pop or jazz or whatever, No Doubt makes it sound good. Gwen Stefani gets compared to Madonna, which embarrasses her, but she's a cute little blonde chick with Italian roots, so how could we not picture her as a mini-Madonna after Don't Speak, even though some of us can't help but gag at the comparison LOLDavid Rehakauthor of &quot;A Young Girl's Crimes	9
"Review no.88.Recorded in 1978,but not released until umteen years later.Looks to be the band's fifth effort.One could say that 'Static Age' was the definitive punk/metal cross over.Featured on this seventeen track disc are three new tunes,which are actually pretty good,""She"",""Spinal Remains"" and ""In The Doorway"".Some of the other tunes I thoroughly enjoyed were the title cut ""Static Age"",the ass kickin' ""T.V. Casualty"",""Teenagers From Mars"" and ""We Are 138"".Should appeal to most fans of Black Flag,Circle Jerks,Fear,Minor Threat and The Cramps(now you're taking!).A should-have."	9
No, it's just a young Glenn Danzig. The Misfits were the epitome of punk; insofar as they had no chops to speak of. To compensate for this; they simply turned their guitar's up as loud as they possibly could. As a  corollary to this; they come across here as sounding vaguely industrial,  or; somewhat akin to another east-coast punk outfit, Suicide. Interesting  and tenative sounding record, but; I'd rather be listening to a superior  punk recording by the likes of Fear or X.	9
5 for the cover, which is incredibly haunting, and probably one of the best covers ever, and then 5 for the music.  this ep is amazing, taking you from under the sea to the furthest star and back in only 2 songs.  it's all instrumental, except for the shouting of &quot;1, 2, 3!&quot; before the rocking breakdown at the end of track 2.  i don't know what else to say, because there is no way you can describe this in words.  buy it.	9
Obviously, from all the other reviews posted here, there is quite the chasm between the love-or-hate-it listeners.  I am here to comment only on the audio.The original, now out-of-print 1990 Chrysalis-label CD was just an LP-EQ'd master transfered to CD.  The 1997, also now unfortunately OOP UK BGO-label version, was properly remastered for CD, and is head-and-shoulders the superior version of the two.So, if you are going to buy this somewhat controversial album, at least get the version that sounds the best... The BGO.	9
Just a classic CD on this one. Wow, from start to finish, this album is just loaded with tracks from &quot;Your Body's Callin'&quot; to &quot;12-Play&quot;. My favorite track is &quot;Seems Like Your Ready&quot;, a slept on classic song. To me this is where R. Kelly starts production spree of songs from Hi-Five's &quot;Quality Time&quot; on. Of course, the two stand out songs with the remixes for &quot;Bump &amp; Grind&quot; &amp; Your Body's Callin'&quot;. So please get this one because it is a definite can't miss.	9
"I listen to alot of music and performers/song writers. I've read reviews of Nick Drake for awhile now and thought, ""I have to get his cd's and check him out.""  So I bought a copy of Pink Moon.  I've listened to it many of times now to try and get what lots of other people are getting from him, but to no avail.  I'm sorry, but it's just a lame cd to me.  I'm going to stick with the more dynamic songwriting Nick; Nick Cave."	9
"""Operation Stackola"", the debut album from the Luniz is one of the hardest rap albums I own. At first, I bought the album for the song ""I Got 5 On It"" (which went all the way to #8 on the Billboard Hot 100 in 1995.) Then I went further into the album. My three favorites are: ""Broke H*'s"", ""Playa Hata"", and ""900 Blame a N***a"". If you want to buy a tight rap album, and be slightly nostalgic at the same time, buy ""Operation Stackola""!"	9

OK.. I'm shallow.  I was watching $25,000 Pyramid when Lisa and Dweezel were guest contestants. I thought to my self, &quot;Wo, she's really good looking.&quot;  I remembered liking that video where she walks around the apartment in one long shot and wondered if she had any chops other then cool glasses. So I started pickin up used CD's when I could find them and was moving in a Lisa fan direction.  This one sealed the deal.  Smart musician, with a unique pocket.  She just got prettier.....	9
This cd is awesome and its amazing that the Tempts are still going and going strong. Can't help but to think what could have been had Paul, David, Eddie and Melvin lived. But I don't want that to take away from the guys that are in the Tempts now. This cd is so smooth and romantic that you can't help but to fall in love with this cd. Plus, the guys look great. If you are a serious R&amp;B fan, then this cd is a must!!	9
"Not as good as the Getz/Gilberto album (how many albums are?) recorded two years later, but it is a very enjoyable effort by saxman Getz and guitarist Charlie Byrd. Unlike the Getz/Gilberto record, this one has no vocals. It's a short and sweet instrumental effort without a note wasted or misplaced. Desafinado (""Out of Tune"") and Samba de Uma Nota So (""One Note Samba"") are the standouts. The album is expensive considering the 35 minute playing time, but you will listen to it many times, trust me."	9
Pink Moon is the one of the most revealing folk/singer-songwriter records out there..which is odd, because the lyrics are impenetrably nonsensical. I think the reason Pink Moon is such an emotionally stirring record are Drake's melodies and the intimate recording style; as well, the strange guitar tunings provide the mystique necessary to buffer the lyrics' surrealist imagery. The magic of this album is in it's less-is-more approach that conveys Drake's mental state at the time. A fitting elegy for one of folk-rock's most talented, and troubled, songwriters.	9
Nick Drake-Pink Moon ****1/2Pink Moon is one of the most alluring albums in the history of music. Both dark and ominous and yet somehow either hits you as a incredibly hopeful piece of music or the bleakest track listing this side of Big Stars THIRD album.With songwriting so sharp and poetic it drives you nuts and encapsulates you with each listen. Acoustic guitar work to write home about combining to make a sheer classic.Pink Moon is an album for all times, moods, and most importantly all collections.	9
No Doubt beared platinum fruit with this delectable collection of charttoppers and sparkling So Cal/ska-meets-punk-meets-pop. This is an incredible album which showcases the amazing versatility of each member of the group and highlights Gwen's incredibly expressive and confessional songwriting. This album just gets you jumping up and down, and happy. With sing-a-longable songs and irrepresibly irrestible rhythms, how could you go wrong? They stay in your head and they make you happy. Perfect music for listening to on the freeway an hour before dusk. Ascension-like. Very recommended.	9
&quot;Walk On By&quot; completely altered the sound and scope of 70's soul and &quot;Hyberbolicsyllabicsesquedelamystic&quot; re-wrote the book on length, sound, texture and content in most popular music, oh, and it GROOVES LIKE A LOCOMOTIVE! This sprawling masterwork (containing only 4 tracks) is still an impressive LP more than 30 years after it's release and dozens of other soul/rock artists followed the path Hayes laid down. There is not a moment wasted here and Hayes proves himself to be a writer, arranger, composer and player without peer.Essential Listening.	9
15 years after this album came out and I am still enjoying this release. The first time I heard the lyrics of I'm a player, I was in high school and it took me 2 days to learn the lyrics. That's how much I was listening to this album. The beats are dope and  too short's lazy flow is right on point. This album is a classic. It is probably my favorite too short album next to Life is.....too short and cocktails. Definitely a must for your collection.	9
Toni Braxton took off like a spaceship in the 1990's. Secrets, her second album, remains as one of the most romantic and simple albums I've ever heard from her. Romantic Ballads like Un-Break My Heart, and In The Late Of Night, showcase her talent in R&amp;B as a strong siren. While dance tracks Come On Over Here and You're Makin Me High, inject an grittier sound in her voice. This is the one album I enjoyed the most that Toni Braxton released. It was really worth the bucks.	9
You know,even with classic radio hits like &quot;Wouldn't It Be Nice&quot;,&quot;God Only Knows&quot; and &quot;Sloop John B&quot; I just can't putThe Beach Boys &quot;Pet Sounds&quot; into my CD player and not listen tothe entire album in one sitting!I'd be missing out on my favoritesongs like &quot;Don't Talk&quot;,&quot;Let's Go Away For Awile&quot;,&quot;Caroline No&quot;,&quot;I Just Wasn't Made For These Times&quot;...I can go on and on,really!This has less weak cuts then The Beatles &quot;Sgt.Pepper&quot; and thatonly had ONE mildly weak song if that tells you anything.Okay-order this NOW!It will brighten your day!	9
The best thing about getting old classics, is that they are inexpensive and still worth the listen. I may be 23 but I'm very old-school and when growing up all I'd listen to is Lionel Richie, Stevie Wonder, Marvin Gaye, etc. But who I loved most of all was listening to Billy Ocean. Takes me back to my happier years and having fun. There are a few tracks that I don't remember but they are still good, takes me back to the Miami Vice theme wearing white pants era.	9
Ok, this set has several of Monk's classsic compositions and is solid throughout. How could it not be with Monk , Coltrane, Blakey and Coleman Hawkins. I will say this..You WILL NEVER hear a better rendition of Ruby My Dear than the one rendered here. Hawkins playing is absolutely magnificent on that track. It would be worth the price of this cd just for that one cut. The bonus is that the rest of the cuts are extremely well played Monk Music so you can't miss with this one.	9
i got this because i remember all my buddies from athens loved these guys, and had played me songs on occasion because i was the resident drummer and this is the resident favorite band of indie rock drummers. why? because damon che, drummer and band leader, is a crazed lunatic with mad skills and forearms the size of florida and the yucatan peninsula, respectively. it's all hardcore-ish math/art/experimental/prog rock. basically. all you need to know is that it's a bunch of noise with some absolutely phenomenal drumming thrown in.	9
If one could own only five or ten discs from the 1970's this had better be one of them.  &quot;Innervisions&quot; is a astoundingly good album.  There is no filler here, everything is lean and mean.  Of course, the Red Hot Chili Peppers covered &quot;Higher Ground&quot; years ago, but Stevie's version is the only one that sounds right to me.  Also listen to &quot;All in love is fair&quot; and &quot;Visions&quot;-gorgeous songs.  On a side note, jazz saxophonist Joshua Redman covered &quot;Visions&quot; beautifully on his release &quot;Timeless Tales for Changing Times.&quot;  Essential.	9
As any reviewer can tell you,Innervision reputation preceeds the 1973 masterpiece.The newly remastered version(8 of the 9 tracks appears in remastered form on At the Close Of A Century box set)also includes a better packaging job compared to its first pressing as well as superior sound quality that makes this sounds like listening to it for the first time all over again.Like the rest of his 70s masterpieces(Music Of My Mind,Talking Book,Fullfillingness...)this remastering project give his music the respect that it has always accorded with the sound quality it deserves.	9
"FIRST OF ALL, ANY STEVIE WONDER THAT WAS RELEASED BEFORE 1980 IS A CLAWSSIC ALBUM, NO QUESTIONS ASKED, END OF DISCUSSION. THE MAN JUST OOZES TALENT, AND HAS SINCE HE WAS 11 YEARS OLD.  THIS ALBUM FINDS STEVIE REALLY STARTING TO FIND HIS OWN VOICE. DON'T GET ME WRONG, HE HAD RECORDED A LOT OF GREAT MATERIAL BEFORE THIS, BUT HERE HE IS FINALLY STARTING TO BREAK OUT, AND THIS ALBUM IS THE PRECURSOR TO ""MUSIC OF MY MIND"", ""TALKING BOOK"", INNERVISIONS"", AND OTHER GREAT ONES TO COME OUT AFTER."	9
"""Get In Where You Fit In"" is not only my favorite album by Too Short, but definitely one of my all time favorite hip hop records. The first six tracks of the album starts the lp off with a bang, while it kinda slows down later on. ""I'm a Player"" and ""Just Another Day"" are what made me want to buy this years ago. I'm not into the new stuff Short's doing these days, but i always listen to the Golden Age Short (88-94 or 95). Short Dog's best, bar none."	9
...I love this because it has that ultro long version of &quot;Walk On By&quot; (I used to boast to my 45 singles buying friends that they did not know how much they were being cheated)(Da-da DA-da DA-da Daaah-Duuum!) and the big hit you never get to hear anywhere--not even on classic soul radio--&quot;By the Time I Get to Phoenix&quot;...where you can imagine that dude going back to the hills of Tennessee after Iko's fabulous set up. The Barkays and the precursors to the Movement? Awesome. Get it and blow your mind.	9
Stevie Wonder is still a ways away from his 70's breakout sound but he's getting alot closer.His heavy use of the clavinetand funky material like &quot;You Can't Judge A Book By It's Cover&quot;and a cover of The Beatles &quot;We Can Work It Out&quot; get the ball rolling.He still serves up the classic title hit as well assome interesing tunes like &quot;I Can't Let My Heaven Walk Away&quot;.But as with all period Motown releaes it has it's padding-marked by formless filler material between the singles.But thatwould change in the next couple years!	9
I'm not sure how I missed this album when it first appeared. I was in graduate school at the time and not buying many albums. Maybe that explains it. Anyway, there are some great tunes here. &#34;The Only One,&#34; a blistering reunion with Robert Plant, is the first one that jumps out. &#34;Prison Blues,&#34; with Chris Farlow on vocals, is a stellar blues guitar workout. Then there's &#34;Blues Anthem,&#34; again with Farlow, to close out the album. These are the most obvious highlights, but there isn't a bad tune here. Highly underrated.	9
Audio Fidelity does not use the Original master tapes on this and about all of the CD releases.  They claim the sources they use are going to give the consumer a great sounding CD.If you're not using the Original master tape then you're comparing HDTV to analog TV.This version sounds very slightly better then the Motown release but compare the cost.I wish Mobile Fidleity would release this because they use nothing but the Original Master tape and the sound comes through.A great Stevie Wonder CD, but all of his CD's are great!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!	9
Here is Stevie Wonder's initial project for the 1980's. This album was released in or around September 1980. According to Norm N. Nite's Rock On Almanac,MASTER BLASTER debuted on the radio that month. Wonder did not have hits at all earlier that year. I like I AIN'T GONNA STAND FOR IT which was later covered by Eric Clapton. I heard several songs on Music Choice's Classic R&B channel. One of them was ALL I DO. Anyway,it's a very good album. This is one of five albums that Wonder released in the 80's.	9
Soon I will have to replace this on cd-I have it on vinyl &amp; cassette &amp; played both til they nearly fell apart.  Every song is a gem, from the title track Building The Perfect Beast-great percussion throughout to  the rockin' All She Wants To Do Is Dance.  Once you pop this into your cd  or cassette player you'll want to hear it several times.  If you're not too  enamored of Don's latest cd(Inside Job)then this is the only cd you'll need  to get an idea of how brilliant his singing/songwriting really is.	9
"Toni Braxton waited 3 years to release her sophomore effort, Secrets, which follows the same formula as its predecessor while managing to sound fresh and new. The big ballad ""Un-break My Heart"" is the obvious smash hit, but other classics include the sultry ""You're Makin' Me High"" and the relaxing ""Let it Flow."" Smooth album cuts like ""Why Should I Care"" and ""Come on Over Here"" ensure that the album moves with a soulful, slow-burn feel from beginning to end. Secrets is the rare sophomore album that outdoes the artist's debut. 4 Stars."	9
ah yes...grover washington, jr.mister magic......this is that thang here! that 70's jazz-funk is a beautiful thang yall!!! brother gro' done did some damage with this one!i have a couple other grover cd's but mostly his late 80's work... but this time period was a good time for urban music (until disco blew up and jus got outrageous! - but disco grew outta this type of stuff...)i love hip hop and sampled music, but this is where that stuff finds its origins: grown folks with real instruments workin up a sweat!can you dig it???	9
This is a dope album by a very young and under rated e-40. I brought this in 97 and took a chance buying it because I never heard it. im a big e-40 fan and i have of his other cds but this one got by me. The song federal is super tight that will break your speakers.This cd is great but not as good as the mail man which came after this. But this is a must has if your a e-40 fan cause it has great those old  cali mob style beats.	9
"For all you Costello completists out there, DO NOT toss your Rykodisc copy once you get this new Rhino version.  There are two ""Live in Aberdeen"" tracks on the Ryko pressing that did not get carried over onto the new one.As for the record itself, when I first bought the vinyl 20+ years ago, I knew very few of the songs and had none of the original versions.  Now I have almost all of them, as well as a deep appreciation for country music.  I have Elvis and my wife to thank for that!"	9
Easily one of the best albums of the eighties,'The End of the Innocence'still shines brilliantly.Henley has one of the most recognizable voices in business and on this record he took his great songwriting skills  to the limit;what makes this CD so great is not the star studded cast(Bruce  Hornsby,Axl Rose,Wayne Shorter,to name a few)but rather the exceptional  quality and maturity of the songs;they are utterly cinematic and  compelling,e.g.'New York Minute',as if each one encompasses a novel-they  also exude a certain timelesness making them sound fresh even today.Music  like this is hard to come by!	9
This is one of the best CD's I have. But I think that they did a better job at their new album, return of saturn. Tragic Kingdom was released in 1995, and now it is 2001, so people still listen to their 6 year ago songs. NO DOUBT'S SONGS NEVER GET OLD!!!!!!THIS BAND ROCKS!!!!!!!I just keep loving their songs more and more and more,,,,and I am sure that I will still keep listening to TRAGIC KINGDOM EVEN IF I HAD IT FOR 6 YEARS NOW....  You are doing great guys....KEEP UP THE EXCELLENT WORK!!!!	9
"But it's not. Any way you slice it though it's still good. The weak spot here was the cover of ""Our Day Will Come"". However, it made up for it rather nicely with the cover of ""The Look Of Love"" which has reminiscence of the Philly Soul sound from the 70's. His was an even better version than Vanilla Fudge's. He also did a top notch cover of ""You Lost That Loving Feeling"". I write this not because we happen to share the same last name, but because it's some good sounding soul music."	9
The combination of Organized Noize, Kast and Goodie Mob made this classic pop back in the summer of 94. This joint put Atlanta on the map for real. Andre came hard lyrically with a New York influenced flow with Big Boi playing cleanup man. Sleepy Brown had the Curtis Mayfield'esque vibe going on. This joint laid the ground work for what would later lead the South dominating rap music.Top Joints:MyintrotoletuknowAin't No Thang  (Hard)SouthernplayalisticadillacmuzikPlayer's Ball (Original)Claimin' TrueFunky RideGit Up, Git Out  (Classic Ceelo chorus.

Wow!  What a collection.  It opens up with ENDLESS LOVE and only gets better.  From R&amp;B to Disco to Motown.  This album is truly well-rounded and a must-have for everyone!You can hear her vulnerability in songs like &quot;It's My Turn,&quot; &quot;Theme From Mahogany (Do You know Where You're Going To)&quot; and &quot;Touch Me In the Morning.&quot;She'll get you boogie-in' with &quot;Upside Down,&quot; &quot;I'm Coming Out,&quot; &quot;The Boss&quot; and &quot;Love Hangover.&quot;We even get treated with her old Supremes stuff.  A medley of it!  All in one!  You must buy this CD!  It's one of my favorites.	9
This may not be their best album, but it's easily their most popular. The casual fan will find their biggest hits on here. This was released in 1987, and includes &quot;Still Of The Night&quot;, &quot;Is This Love&quot;, and the huge hit &quot;Here I Go Again&quot;. However most of the other tracks are nearly as good. &quot;Crying In The Rain&quot; and &quot;Children Of The Night&quot; are two other favorites. Overall they were one of the better hard rock/metal bands of the era, and had great taste in hood-ornaments too. Also better than &quot;Great White&quot;, and &quot;White Lion&quot;.	9
"The 5 stars isnt for her beauty, for her musical talent. I have listened to this album countless times. Without a doubt a classic. Im not too big on much R & B I am more into underground hiphop but I have to admit this is music that will be felt from all musical background based audiences. I heard somewhere this album is like 10+ platinum.. and that isnt too hard to believe. Her 2 most international hits ""Makin me High"" and ""Unbreak My Heart"" on on this album. So make sure you get this album."	9
"I collect Beach Boys & this is just another example of the best album The Beach Boys ever put to wax. After they released the CD the first time it contained the mono/stereo versions (which I prefer the mono) with a bonus track. Then a box set devoted to the album. Now they release it like the single CD but, with a DVD to further cement this album as one of the best ever released. I highly recommend this one if your looking to check out what the fuss is all about. Search ""Judemac Forever"" on msn."	9
I don't know why this album gets the props it does. there doesn't seem to be any point where the production or the emceeing tries to grab you....and yet this is heralded as not only a classic, but by many people as the greatest hip hop album ever. It's nowhere near an Illmatic, The Infamous, Stress The Extinction Agenda, 93 to Infinity, any Kool G Rap' early to mid 90's stuff, Stunts Blunts & Hip Hop, Bizarre Ride II The Pharcyde etc, etc, etc...it doesn't even come close to 36 Chambers. I think this album is boring.	9
Not knowing anyone who doesn't own this, or love this, is not surprising. Tragic Kingdom is what brought No Doubt up the charts, with the classic ska ballad Don't Speak. A lot happend to the band during this album including the band's jealousy of Gwen being the only one noticed. As you listen, you can actually hear the true closeness this band has. This album in particular heads toward a rock-edge, with enough trumpets to explode the sound system. What makes Tragic Kingdom noteworthy is the bands adorable, yet rock-hard tune, and the incredible, fun-loving band itself.	9
The one thing about this CD is how Babyface and Toni Braxton have the same style.What a perfect match.When I first heard &quot;Another Sad Love Song,&quot; I was blown away from this new singer.The deep soulfull voice was beutifull.&quot;Best Friends,&quot; written my Toni is one of my favorites from the album,but the one that really gets my heart pumping is &quot;Seven Whole Days.&quot;In some ways,I can see alot of Anita Baker's vocals in Toni on this cut,and thats a compliment.I really enjoyed this debut record from Toni.One of the great talented singers to come from the 90's.	9
What can I say about this classic hip hop album that hasnt already been said!!!!!  to be honest..... not much.  But this is my Favorite 2pac album ever!!!!  In my opinion, 2pac isnot only the greatest rap artist ever but also the greatest writer in hip hop!!!!!  This album is just an example of what he can do with his incredible talents in a short amount of time.  Every song on here gets at least 4.5 stars......  I would go in more detail... but so much has been said by so many other people........ Its the GREATEST!!!!!	9
Teena, has done some outstanding work in her lifetime, no one can deny that...and I've gone out of my way to collect it all again on CD.  But when I tell you, this little gem is the cream of her crop, I kid you not!  The songs, You make love like springtime, Irons in the Fire, Young Love and Tune in Tomorrow, plus the springtime reprise (well as you can see practically the whole darn set) will move anyone with a heart, spirit and musical soul!  This is a rare gem of talent exposed and on display.	9
"Listening to ""In Concert"" today, I am struck by Joan Baez's keen ability to interpret these beautiful folk songs.  She truly was in her element.  More than that ""achingly pure soprano,"" she was able to convey the drama, the pathos, and the sheer longing of the lyrics.  Just listening to her performance of ""Matty Groves,"" I can get so drawn in to the song that I can visualize the proceedings.  She was also a very accomplished and talented guitar player.  Joan Baez had a tremendous impact on American popular music and you can hear why in this recording."	9
One of the best hip-hop albums to ever be released ever. Hott beats and true hip-hop lyrics keep you wanting more from GZA. This album is insane, dark and grimey.

If the Plimsouls' Everywhere At Once is supposed to be New Wave, I just can't hear it. These twelve cuts sound like Rockabilly, and lackluster Rockabilly at that. The Stray Cats have done this stuff to death. There's an oh-too-familiar sameness to it all: the fast tempo gets boring. And the pedestrian drumming grates on my nerves. The work of the Plimsouls is interchangeable with that of the Go Go's, only the Go Go's are cuter, but just as banal. No doubt, Peter Case is a talented lyricist and musician, but the never ending Rockabilly gimmick wears thin.	9
On a shopping spree, I bought this one, speak no evil and maiden voyage. Well, after listening to all three, this one just stay in my cd player. Some of the best music ever recorded in any kind of music. Beware: it was recorded by Mingus on a portable equipment. The sound quality is not for this age of 2000 bit digitally remastered. Sometimes the players are recorded at differnet volumes throughout the album. But dont let that prevent you from listening to this amazing, work of art. If No Parker, no Miles, no Coltrane, no Mingus, etc.	9
"I'm not gonna bore you with another long review,but if I was stranded on a desert island and I had only a few discs with me,Stevie Wonder's ""Songs In The Key In The Life"" would my top choices.So many great songs(Sir Duke,I Wish,Knocks Me Off My Feet,Summer Soft,Isn't She Lovely,As,Another Star,Love's In Need Of Love Today,Ebony Eyes,If It's Magic etc.)with no filler whatsoever.Plus the updated version(supervised by Harry Weinger and remastered by Kevin Reeves at Universial Mastering East)is excellent,with punchy,spacious,vibrant sound and all the original artwork,liner notes and lyrics included.Truly a must-have in every sense of the word!"	9
A very pleasant album, immaculately produced, perhaps a masterpiece of British folk. The songs are nice and pleasing, very pleasant to listen to: relaxing. Drake's delicate acoustic guitar work is fine and suits the songs perfectly, augmented by fine string and wind arrangements (though they can be slightly overbearing at times), and bright splashes of piano. Drake's own lyrics are beautiful examples of understated emotional poetry. His vocals are distinctive, very English, and a good medium for communicating this poetry, especially with this musical backing. It's a nice package. Certainly a hallmark recording for anyone interested in British folk.	9
"I listened to this for the first time in a long time recently and was pleasantly surprised at how good it sounds.This is the ultimate No Doubt album - terrific sound of ska/new wave/pop.  Listening to this album again during our present penchant for 80's revival made me realize that ""Tragic Kingdom"" was about 10 years ahead of it's time.""Spiderwebs"", ""Excuse Me Mr"", ""Just A Girl"", ""Sunday Morning"" and ""Don't Speak"" are all great singles.Hopefully this band will truly return to their great roots and return to this fine form in the near future...I think it's the perfect time!"	9
return of the boom bap is a great classic. it's way up there with 93 til infinity by souls of mischief, a future without a past by leaders of the new school, one for all , ed o.g and da bulldogs first album and gang starr step in the arena. it's crafted beats on krs-one album is by the talented dj premier. it's lyrics is so great too. check out sound of the police and mad crew. this is a gifted classic. with it's old school, loud bass original lyrics. definately a must have for any true hip hop head.	9
My favourite tracks on this debut album are those with a fuller instrumentation, i.e. Time Has Told Me with its beautiful electric guitar, piano and bass; Way To Blue with its melancholy mood elegantly expressed in a complex melody and sensitive string arrangement, and; Cello Song, a hypnotic love song with a magical interplay of cello, bass and congas. I also like The Thoughts Of Mary Jane and Three Hours, a brooding little number. As with all Drake's work, the overall mood is one of sadness wrapped in dreamy melodies, where the poetic lyrics take the listener to far-away places.	9
I believe this to be 2pac's best record. He was hungry, coming straight out of jail and recording this double disc album. It has so many classic tracks. Life Goes On, Cali Love RMX, Only God Can Judge Me, Picture Me Rollin, All Eyez on Me,  I Ain't Mad At Cha, and many more. Life Goes On is one of 2pac's deepest and most impressive tracks he ever did. So is Only God can Judge Me. I know you don't want me babbling on about how good this album is so I will give you 3 words. CLASSIC BUY NOW.	9
This set is incredible. I would like to focus on disc 4, the &quot;Rare and Unreleased&quot; disc. It features some of the coolest unreleased Jackson material like the driving funk of the 1972 &quot;Love Scenes&quot;,  the incredible 1972 &quot;Can't Get Ready For Losing You&quot;, never heard  Corporation classics like &quot;Coming Home&quot; and finally a listenable  Jermaine song &quot;I Need You&quot;. There is however a mistake on disc 4.  Number 9 on the cd is not the song it says, it is actually &quot;Ooh I'd  Love To Be With You&quot; from their 1973 SKYWRITER album, but it's still a  worthwhile collection	9
FRESH!  FOR 1988, you SUCKERS!!!How many people can forget that line?  If you don't know it, you don't have the album!  So what are you waiting for?  Buy it!Best Tracks:  &quot;My Philosophy&quot;, &quot;I'm Still  #1&quot;, &quot;Illegal Business&quot;; and the most HARD ROCKING track  is:&quot;YA SLIPPIN&quot;, which hijacks Deep Purple's &quot;Smoke on  the Water&quot; guitar riff and turns it into a hardcore hip-hop battle  rampage.Krs does a nod to spoken word poetry at the end, a first for rap  albums...&quot;See how it sounds, a little un-rational, a lot of MC's  like to use the word 'dramatical'&quot;. CLASSIC MATERIAL, AN YA KNOW  IT!!!!!!!!	9
of course it is..you know that.my first exposure to a nick drake songwas sebadoh's cover of pink moonback in the 90's.for whatever reason i didnt really listen to nick himselfuntil 2007 when i was working at night by myselflistening to a playlist of hundreds of songs made by other coworkers,and this record came on the speakers.i think id always known id get it eventually.i think i had to grow up alot to really get it.now i feel i do more and more.a short perfect quiet melancholy record.very little going on, nothing but what's absolutely necessary.anyway, get it if you love music.	9
"First off, let me say just how much I LOVE the lay-out art work on this CD release (hubba-hubba!). They used several full color adult pin-ups from (would have to be)the late '60's era. I must also admit that I may like this disc better than I do their 'Astro-Creep: 2000' mostly because it has a diverse sound on just about every tune. Totally dug the after dark mix of ""Electric Head Pt. 2"", the raw mix of ""Grease Paint And Monkey Brains"" and the ass-kicking wine, women and song mix of ""Blood, Milk And Sky"" the most. Great compilation CD."	9
"Although not as strong and flowing as the superb ""Saxophone Colussus"" this record still contains some very good tracks. In particular I liked the swinging songs of ""I'm an Old Cowhand"", ""Wagon Wheels"" amd ""Way Out West"" which showcase some great solos from Sonny Rollins.Bassist Ray Brown and Drummer Shelly Manne make worthy contributions with some excellent solos of their own in the rhythm section but feel a little dissapointed with the absence of piano or guitar. When listening to all the songs it sometimes feels in my opinion as if there is something missing eventhough Sonny's playing is mostly wonderful."	9
Although &quot;Don't Speak&quot; was terribly overplayed on the airwaves, (so much so, that after a while I used to change the station whenever it came on) this album as a whole is excellent. I enjoy it more now than I did when it first came out. Gwen has a voice that is different from the run-of-the-mill girl vocalists these days. And the band is very talented, the songs are melodic with great riffs and hooks throughout. No Doubt are one of those bands that write, play and sing their own songs. True talent. The booklet contains all lyrics and lots of photos.	9
My favorite singer of all-time flourishes with this piece of Latin history called AMOR PROHIBIDO.  Her most recognized Tejano recording boasts charming pop/Latin tracks like &quot;Amor Prohibido&quot; and Selena's very own penned &quot;Bidi Bidi Bom Bom&quot;, and the ballady &quot;No Me Queda Mas&quot;.  I give this album 5 out of 5 stars because it shines poignantly like no other of Selena's Latin CDs!  It's not hard to guess why Selena would've been up there with the likes of Whitney Houston and Aretha Franklin.  This is a Classic and a MUST BUY in my mind - and I'm not even Hispanic!  She rules.	9
"This album is just guitar and voice with a smattering of piano here and there. It contains classics like ""Radio"", ""Which Will"" and the well-known title track. ""Know"" is almost bluesy with its simple guitar and haunting voice, while the jangling guitar of ""Parasite"" has an almost hypnotic quality. ""Ride"" has a lovely pop melody and has been covered by other artists, I think. ""From The Morning"" is another pastoral gem. Although delectable in its minimalist elegance, Pink Moon is not my favourite Nick Drake album. I just enjoy his voice more with a fuller instrumental backing. Still, this remains a minimalist classic."	9
Costello's first album, MY AIM IS TRUE, was perfect. His second album, THIS YEAR'S MODEL, is even better. On this album, all of the sexual tension that had been built up on his debut gets released. Just take a look at the  song titles. This album is very much about sex. Fortunately, Costello is  literate enough that he doesn't have to stoop to using graphic language.  Instead, he uses all sorts of similies and metaphors. This album just  explodes with energy. Also, this album serves as a wonderful transition  from his first album, MY AIM IS TRUE, to his third album, ARMED FORCES.	9
I remember when this cd was released in the 80's...the supergroup made of some great musicians of prog music....this album got immediate success, everybody liked it.  Now listen to this cd again and realize how this was a poor cd.  I did and I can say that this album is really poor and I won't listen to it for the rest of my life, this is the kind of pop prog for the mass and has nothing to do with real prog music.  Instead, look for what these guys has made in the 70's with their respective bands and you'll see the difference....	9
Once I picked up &quot;Becoming X&quot;, I felt like I became one of the lucky people who knew this for more than just the great single &quot;6 Underground&quot;. If you liked that song, most of the others are as good. &quot;Low Place Like Home&quot; and &quot;Spin Spin Sugar&quot; I like just as much. My favorite though is &quot;Post-Modern Sleaze&quot;. It consists of this odd combination of acoustic guitar and trip-hop beats, but works really well. Sweet lyrics too. Then the next-to-last song &quot;How Do&quot; is nice and mezemorizing. Some people say this disc sounds dated, but isn't everything? I still play it often.	9
I had never heard of Depeche Mode before &quot;It's No Good&quot; was  released. At first, i felt that David Gahan was a Bono look-alike, and his  voice just sounded like every other brit-pop star. After awhile I decided  to listen to the whole album. I fell in love with the dark yet danceable  sound of &quot;Barrel of a gun&quot; and the gothic sounds of &quot;The  Love Thieves&quot; and &quot;Sister of Night.&quot; &quot;Freestate&quot;  is an exceptional track, but the whole album could really kick Robert  Smith's ass (though I am a big-time Cure fan too). Put simply, this is  Depeche Mode at their best.	9
I have been a Mobile Fidelity fan for years.  To be sure their product is always top shelf.  This release is no exception...it beats the socks off of the regular issue in terms of musical presentation.  Still, this recording would shine in 5.1 surround, so come on MoFi, give us a 5.1 presentation.  Sure I know your contract with Sony (CBS) prohibits you from releasing 5.1 CDs of their products, but this is NOT a CBS product.  If you got the original master tapes, getting the original 8 track master would not be much more difficult.  Please try a little harder next time.	9

Man oh man,,,I stuck this sucker in  really less than 2 sec's later it was done...so I thought nah nothing is ever going to clean my dirty heads of my old VHS player tv combo..................................but how wrong I was...as I did it again just to be sure...and less than 2 sec's later....done !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!...so either dry VHS cleaners are better than the wet type or I and I alone got a magic special cleaner for my tv/vhs combo.............	10
Great for labeling clothing by size and season (e.g., size 5 winter) and toy bins (dolls, puppets, cars, etc.) and freezer bags.  Haven't had a label come off yet (I've been use the label make for about a year).  Split backing makes taking the back off SOO much easier.  As for wasting the lead tape, I try to print several items together with one or two spaces between the items and then cut at the end--saves a little.	10
Yep, it's old style that is back in-style!  These are the best sound quality reproduction, lightest, easy on the ears headphones I have ever purchased.  Great for the laptop, MP3 player, stereo system or your TV.  Koss has not changed a thing in over what 30 years I think and now I know why.  They work great!  Check this out.. my 17 y.o. was shocked at the quality he didn't want to give them back to me. haha!	10
Having been a professional photographer for over 25 years I expected Nikon to produce superior results.  Forget that the camera is difficult to use, the final quality of the pictures is poor.  If you shoot only in sunlight  or shadow it's OK, but mix them and the result is unacceptable.  No  latitude, or gamma, and even Photoshop fails to correct the problems.  Maybe in the future, but until then, buy something to play with but use  real film.  I returned mine...	10
Given their price, these are pretty decent headphones, and worth the cash.My only two problems with it - first, they need to be resized every time you put them on, because they seem to suffer from &quot;pool shrinkage&quot; - they shrink to the smallest size once you take them off.And second is the one brought up fairly often - they don't do anything to block out outside noise. Which isn't that big a deal, as I didn't really need noise-blocking headphones anyway.	10
These headphones are ugly but sound great, they are also very comfortable.  Perfect for home, I wouldn't wear these out as they are goofy looking and are not noise-cancelling.PROS- Sound is great, bass and all.- iPod/iPhone friendly plug.- Lightweight and comfortable.- The price is right.CONS- Need to re-adjust the head band occasionally when you put them back on as it will slide when you take them off.- Not very cool looking, I would probably buy these in black if I was ordering again.	10
Needed a CB for a Jeep Jamboree and will likely only need it once or twice a year. Perfect for this radio. Price is right, easy install, good for a Jeep where there's 0 room for full size perm CB. Did a perm antenna install, ran the coax just to the right of the console, keep the cb in the center console and pull it out when I need it. Can't speak for the portable performance but as an in-car cb, it's perfect for occasional use.	10
"Using inline with my Sennheiser headphones. Control wheel in cavity of housing, so vol. control won't get accidently turned, and it stays where you set it. Good volume range easy to set to right level. Cord a bit long, when adding to my already long earphones cord, but I just coil up the volume control extra ! Good 1/8"" plug fit one end and strain relief on other end at cord. Getting another for my Koss headphones. Clip on it, to affix to like a belt."	10
"I did not have any problem using it but my cassette player (in car) is still showing ""clean player"" message. It is playing the tapes as before and I cannot tell any difference in sound quality, but I should say that the quality was never that bad. I used this product because the player started showing me that message and that problem is not solved. I really don't know whether the cleaner did not do its job or simply my player is faulty (or have other issues)."	10
I wouldn't waste my time on this product.  The range isn't nearly what was advertised.  It says 150 feet, but I can barely get them to work across the room.  It's even worse in a two-story house.  God forbid if you want to have the transmitter downstairs and the speaker upstairs or outside.  They are prone to hissing and popping and my set has an annoying, high-pitched whine.  Even the slight motion can interfere with the signal. I should have returned them when I had the chance.	10
I've tried a LOT of headphones and earbuds over the years.  I returned four different pairs of various brands before I bought these Sonys.  They blow the competition at this price away, and lots of more expensive models as well.  I've had mine for over two years and they are in pristine condition.  I use them almost every day and drag them around everywhere with me and they have held up admirably.  The balance and sound quality are exquisite, and I don't hand out compliments that easily.	10
I got this for my wife as a Christmas present because we have a bunch of books in ePub format. I put them on a microSD card, went through the arduous setup procedure and now it will not open any of my books. I have, over 6 hours invested today trying to get support help. Phone goes to some third world place and I cannot understand the people. Chat (4 times) is better but they finally concluded it wad my credit cards fault!! Basically, useless support.Returning it tomorrow...	10
"It's only 1/2"" wide, but you get great black letters on a sparkling white background.  That slit down the rear--easy splitting backer means no more broken fingernails, no more using the family chisel to expose the adhesive.  What cooler sound than the whirr of a Brother 1280 as your freshly minted label shoots out the side slot, ready to take on the world.  File folders, basement shelves, neighborhood cats--231 organizes them all with finesse.  You won't find a better TZ label tape than TZ231.  Stick it with pride!"	10
When I learned the modifications Barnes & Noble made to its Nooks and saw the price drop, I decided to get one formy very active 6 year-old grandson. He loves it. Despite him being a rough & tumble outdoor boy, it has held up wellfor a few months now. I attribute this partly to solid quality build and partly to the Nook HD 7&#34; being so thin & lightweight.I recommend this tablet, especially for children, a much better buy than those heavier, more expensive & slower tabletssold for children.	10
Great little drive.  It gave me the additional space to load more maps on my Nuvi.  I also use one in my wife's camera.  Any time I use her camera, I swap out the memory card so my pictures are not on her card.  She has about 3000 pictures on her card and uses her camera with that card as a portable photo album.  This card is so inexpensive that I use one to back up her photos even though I have never had one of these cards fail.	10
I bought this bag for a 15.4'' laptop mbp, an extra battery, a spare HD, and some papers. Not very much stuff. So I was extremely disappointed that a $ 90 leather bag that supposedly was of good quality had one of the straps completely rip off the body of the bag, where the strap was stitched in the side.This bag was used for 7 months before the strap ripped under normal, daily usage. There was nothing done to shorten the life of a bag such as this one.	10
Belkin is a classy company indeed. I am frequently plugging and unplugging my laptop from this cable and the tab that keeps the wire in the R-45 jack broke off after about 6 months of heavy use. Went to their website, put a claim in and they mailed me out a new one the next day, no questions asked. Sweet.UPDATE 8/08 Belkin now makes a50FT CAT6 Black Patch Cable Snagless RJ45M/RJ45Mthat is better made, transmits data faster and supports 1000 MBps networks and probably best of all is cheaper.	10
The radio is made of great quality, but like others have wrote the range when it's in carry mode is very bad. So if your thinking about using this as a bug out item don't. To use this for a bug out scenario wouldn't work unless the person you're talking to is standing right next to you. In car mode with a antenna it's cool as heck.  It has all the bells and whistles in place back light, weather, rechargeable battery pack with power cord,  and more....Good job Midland	10
I have a very nice set of stereo headphones which, for reasons I cannot understand, does not include an in-line volume control.  I purchased the Koss VC20 to insert in the playback circuit when I needed an in-line volume control.  The device works perfectly, just as it is supposed to.  The only minor drawback is that the notched wheel with which you change the volume setting is rather small and quite sensitive - only a potential disadvantage for folks with large fingers.  Overall, I'm totally satisfied with this product.	10
I was looking for an economical cleaning solution for my DVDs so took a chance on these and ordered them from Amazon. I don't know what they're made of but they work great. They clean blu-ray as well as regular DVDs without a bit of scuffing or scatching. I followed the instructions and wiped the discs from the centre toward the outside edge. For fingerprints, I found it also helps to breathe on the disc before wiping. The nice thing about these is that they're re-usable until they get dirty.	10
This excellent headset in an outstanding bargin. Sound quality is excellent with several cell phones I have tried, and it is good with most cordless house phones (cordless phones sometimes have poor gain on the  mic).In fact, sound quality is vastly better with other types of  earpieces and ear buds. In a normal room, no one will know you are using  it. In a car, it is slightly noticable.Some friends complain that the  earpiece flops around a bit, but indeed, it never falls off. (Unless you  have really small ears).	10
If you're like me, you use two or more PC's over the course of a normal workday and you use your PalmVx religiously.  Your Palm already came with one cradle, but you really need an extra to ensure all your PC's are in sync.What more can be said...it's the same high quality and easy to use charging cradle that came with your Palm.  Mostly a convenience thing for casual users, but for those who use their Palms alot, you need an extra.  Pick one up now while they're still available.	10
I like it BUT it has a 3 foot cord.  Add that to the 3 foot cord from my headset and I am dragging around 6 foot of cord.  I have quit using it because I catch it on so many things.  I will be looking for a shorter cord for the headset.  It would have been nice if the cord was removable. I don't really want to replace my headset cord and finding a shorter replacement that will fit my JVC headset is turning out to be a challenge.	10
the battery is great-about 12-14 hours from 80% charged.  I was wondering how i would like an e-reader vers a book, and i must say that i don't even notice the difference.  love everything about it.  The only thing that could be better is the on/off function and wi-fi.  the power button is very sensistive and is tricky to turn on (at first).  the ewifi range is short.  maybe 30 ft from my router is all i can go.  other than that.  it works great, and at a very fair price	10
It seems to be a limited device, but it has potential  I think a good price it new should be about $55.00. I have one as a backup to my kindle P.W there are two pros ,the SD card slot and it can be rooted, but rooting affects battery life and its not stable when rooted. Very very limited web browser no Facebook or anything useful, the browser on the the paperwhite is much better. It is a pretty well made device.It is a ok back up to my kindle paperwhite.	10
I was looking around for a small radio to have at my desk at work. I figured with a smaller unit, I would save space and not have a very good sound. I was wrong about this unit. I was very pleased to listen to the quality of sound from this unit. 2 people that sit near me in my office have enjoyed this radio as well and have ordered one for themselves as well. I highly recommend this product. It is a good price, small, and has a great sound.	10
These are just about the best headphones you can get for ~$25.The entire sound range is great.  Great response, great bass, clear midrange.  Gives the original Sennheiser PX-100 (another excellent headphone) a run for its money at less than half the price.By the way - The drivers are identical to the famous Koss PortaPro Headphones.  Despite what some claim, the sound between the Sportapro and the Portapro is identical.  I've owned at least 3 pairs of each and there is no sound difference between the two.  Just buy whichever is cheaper.	10
We needed a wall mount for a 32&#8221; TV that was going to be in the screened in porch.  This was one of the brands recommended by the guy that was going to install out wall mount.  I can&#8217;t speak to the ease or difficulty of installation but it looks great and we can swivel it if necessary for best viewing angle.  It's also pretty sleek so it doesn't butt out too much.  It arrived quickly and it didn&#8217;t take the installer long but of course he was a professional.  Looks great!	10
I needed a replacement battery for a Davis Weather Station, which uses solar cells to power the remote sensors.  After finding out that non-rechargeable batteries only lasted 2-3 weeks, the realization finally penetrated my thick skull that a solar cell won't do much for a non-rechargeable battery.  I bought this product, and am very happy with it. My weather station is happy again, the charger itself (which I've only used for the initial charge) worked quickly and without a hitch.  The product design is pleasant and fool proof.  I'm a satisfied customer.	10
These headphones have some nice features. They are a nice shape that fits comfortably on the head. They are a nice size that are fairly easy to carry around for non-lightweight headphones. They also have a very nice long cord that gives a lot of reach. The only issue I have is that they are a bit more quiet and less responsive than other headphones I have used that cost about the same. If you want a nice pair of headphones that are easy to carry around, it's tough to beat these.	10
I have many headphones, many of the head band variety and some of the conventional earbud variety. This is my first purchase of the in the ear type. I never expected the fit to be as comforatble as I found it to be, and did not expect the sound to be as good as it is. I think that Koss is aiming for high volume sales at a very low price for such an excellent product. On top of it all they offer a lifetime guarantee. How can you beat this bargain?	10
I ride a scooter (aka Vespa) and it is inconvenient to reach the volume control of my mp3 player while I'm riding, so I decided to buy this and so far I'm pleased. I love how I can clip it on my shirt and easily access it. One thing to mention is that it does not amplify sound so it will only go as loud as the music player can go. I believe there is no degradation in sound quality so that is great. Overall I'd recommend it based on my experience.	10
The sound from these headphones is top of the line, its a pleasure to listen to my music with these phones. They are light on the head and stay that way using them for extended amounts of time.  Dislikes;  I don't like having to adjust them each time I put on my head but you soon forget doing the adjustment soon as the music starts. The cable is a little short for me but works. I would recommend these phones but you have to be gentle with them especially with the connector.	10
I already had two of these in the household, but my son has been asking for his own since the first day I got mine. I am very pleased with the Nook Color as it does a wide range of functions. I have been able to do my university homework and write papers on mine, in addition to reading ebooks, .pdfs, and watching videos. My daughter reads, listens to music, and watches videos. My son will be making use of reading books for his age group and reading level, and watching instructional videos.	10
So I just got an iPod 4GB from Amazon and was dying to play it in my ride. Unintentioanlly I saw this in a friend's car and I did some research and a week later it's in my hands. Well, I have to say this is an impressive tape adaptor. The sound quality is just as good as playing a CD and the stereo in my car reads it smoothly. On top of that, it's inexpensive!So if you are looking for a tape adapto for your iPod, you should get this one! :)	10
I'll admit it, I bought the case (the metallic blue one too!) just because it was sexy. It does a good job protecting my Palm Vx, but the case doesn't seem sturdy. There also seems to be a problem where the contrast button at the top of the Palm Pilot gets pressed by the case, this can be fixed by sliding the Palm just a hair. Overall, this case rocks, very glad I got it, the metallic blue one is better though, I get many compliments and good looks from it. Buy It!	10
Batteries are expensive no matter what you buy.  This recharger is inexpensive and dependable.  Given that there are four battery docks, you'll never run out of charged batters.  This recharger quickly charges nickel metal hydrido (NiMH), nickel-cadmium (NiCD), AAA, AA or 9V rechargeable batteries.  The price is fantastic and what it lacks in aesthetics, it makes up for in power and speed.  When the batteries are charged, the light displays green and be warned that it is normal for the batteries to be warm.  Unfortunately there is no real carrying case for travel.	10
For what these cost they do what they do well. They're very comfortable and conform to my head with the medium setting on the ear-piece adjustment. As far as sound goes, I haven't had any complaints. They sound much better than similarly priced headphones that I've owned, and these will be my permanent headphones for being out and about.Sound leaks of course, but you could tell that from the image. Overall I think these are the best headphone for the price range at the time of this review. They've also been surprisingly durable.	10
"I am impressed with the solid design of this TV Wall Mount.  I think this weights more than the 26"" TV it is supporting.  It also has lots of logical adjustments so leveling the TV isn't too difficult.  The one semi negative is that it takes a fair amount of force to reposition the TV.  This does assure the TV stays put but if you plan to move the TV on the stand a lot this may be a negative.  Overall I am pleased with the stand - it seems like a good value."	10
I drive an old car, without a CD drive. It has a cassette drive, though and I had an additional MP3Player I did not use anymore, so I bought this gadget - and it works! Sound quality is surprisingly good, the basic volume could be a bit higher but otherwiese it produces a clear and rich sound. The only little annoyance is, that now a cable is sticking out of the cassette deck and hangs around the front panel. But eventually I will fix it somewhere, where it is not in the way anymore.	10
Got these to help tame the mess behind my entertainment center. In essence, they work. They are simply velcro ties you can wrap around several cords, holding them in one, neat bundle. They aren't really meant for identifying cables,  but for holding several in a bundle. Because they work great, I can't give them less than 4 stars. $3 and change is pretty cheap, but if you wanted, you could do the same job with much cheaper products,  which is why I didn't give it 5 stars.Summary: Works great. Cheap, but cheaper options available.	10
Aw, come on, Moleskine -- you make a terrific Kindle cover to hold a notepad (Moleskine notepad, even) --- and then NO PEN LOOP? What kind of silliness is THIS???Love it in every way except that darned lack of a pen loop - clipping a pen to it is not the same and I don't want to dent up the cover...Wish it came in more colors, like Moleskine RED and the other Volant shades -- and that one could get the reporter notebooks in colors, too... but this doesn't mean I'm not happy with this!	10
"Like many other people here, my lock jammed. Luckily, I didn't pay for it, my company did. Worked for about 6 months and then just stopped working. I don't think it ""magically"" reset its own combination. Mechanical locks don't do that. More likely the rotating mechanism that allows the lock to unlock got jammed. My IT guy had to saw it off. Did some damage to the cosmetics of my company laptop.Simply put: Don't use this product.Great while it worked. Imagine getting it jammed at a coffee house rather then your office or home. Yikes."	10
I picked up my modem and installed it in just a couple of minutes. It was easy. When I log on, it seems to connect at 49333 every time. I guess that is good because my 33.6 connected at 31.9. I was going to buy that $25 one with the $20. rebate but from the reviews - you get what you pay for. I  went with Diamond and I am glad I did. The box says the requirements are  for a pentium 133 or higher. I have a Pentium 120 and it has worked great.	10
I've been using this tape for my P-Touch for years and it's great.  One cartridge lasts me forever.  I can label anything, including my children's ice packs and cups.  They stay on in the freezer and in the dishwasher.  The ink doesn't smudge, but after a few years of going through the dishwasher, the ink may fade.  If I need to, I just peel off and make another one.  As long as the surface is non-porous, it comes off when I need it to without any trouble without leaving any residue.  What's not to like?	10
I own 3 pairs of these now and am totally satisfied with them.  I have probably about 25 sets of ear buds and headphones for a variety of purposes.  Not any single set serves one purpose but for the purposes I use these for (casual listening while sitting or walking and noise isolation) these are perfect. They're the only device I'll use to listen to music through my smart phone or laptop.  I love the way they seal of the sounds from the outside world as the foam stem covers slowly expand in your ears.	10
For $15, by far the best choice for portable applications, particularly when there's a moderate level of ambient noise.  Excellent for Walkman or MP3 player use at the gym; they block enough sound so that I can hear the music, but I can still hear if someone is talking to me (although I have to remove at least one of the plugs in order to hear what they're saying).Be sure to save the spare ear foam pieces - you'll probably need them eventually, since they don't fit as well after they soften up too much.	10
After 15 years with my pair, I finally blew out the diaphragms.  Bought 2 pair of high-end Bose headphones. Was quite disappointed.Like others have said, these units have changed little since the mid 80's but have fanastic range, thump and boom.  Light weight comfortable and affordable.  Highly responsive coils and foldable design.Highly highly recommended as (in my opinion) being the best portable, non-noise cancelling phones on the market.Will make your mp3 player, walkman or discman much more robust sounding and gives very little ear fatigue,'cept after 4 or more hours of use.Getting another pair ASAP!	10
I had a pair years ago and lost them. If you want a solid pair of headphones that sound excellent these are the headphones for you. I can't believe how many have bought into the Beats headphone hype.. with their muddy bass and  sound decay at high volumes. Save your money on most headphones selling in the $300.00-$500.00 range, Koss sound just as good if not better. The only issue, what's up with the mini case? It's a - - - - getting those phones into that little bitty Koss bag, make the case LARGER.	10
"This thing works great.  Being able to move the cord around is very handy when using this in various places.  I use it in my car & home stereo & the sound quality is very close to a CD. There is not very much ""airy"" sounding feedback either. Make sure to turn the volume all the way up on the device so it will sound the best.I love being able to plug in my Android phone & stream things from the internet through my car stereo!I highly recommend this if you are considering one of these."	10
"This mic is perfect for the person who must have his/her hands free a majority of the time.  I use it on an older Motorola T5500 radio.  The mic comes with a strong metal clip to attach to your clothing or belt.  The speaker sound quality and volume is very good and the PPT button on the mic is easy to use.  The connector is a press fit so if the cord is stretched too far the connector may disconnect.  A small ""tie wrap"" wrapped around the cord and the radio antenna will solve this issue."	10
The delivery was prompt, the item was packed well and the floppy disk drive was plug and play as advertised.  I simply plugged into my computer using the Windows 7 program and the drive self loaded the software which took approximately 1 minute.  It was ready to use.  I was able to transfer my pictures from the floppy disks to CD's enabling me to view my old pictures which I hadn't seen for a long while.  I would, at this point, recommend the Sabrent external floppy disk drive as I am very satisfied with the product.	10
My needs were simple, to lengthen the audio cord so I didn't have to worry about how i sat at work, and volume control.  I sit at the computer a bit from time to time, and like to stream music.The cord is long enough, about 3ft I believe.  The volume control is just that, basically it will not get louder than what the source is putting out, but it means I can adjust it, rather than adjusting the volume on the computer.It does everything it is supposed to, and in a small package.  Worth the purchase.	10
The Koss PortaPro has a great &#34;retro&#34; design because they haven't changed the darn things since they were introduced in the 80s. The reason being that they got it right the first time. The sound quality is great for open design headphones, they're easily adjustable (both the headband and the firmness with which the ears &#34;grab&#34; the head), very light, and can be worn for hours at a time without having any issues.They fold down into a relatively convenient size and even come with a travel bag. If mine get damaged, I will buy another pair.	10
These are old school small headphones and are not particularly stylish. OK, they're ugly. That said, the sound is waaaay excellent. Get over it. Do you want sound better than 'phones costing 4 to 8 times this much or do you want to be stylish? At $32, you've really got to give them a try. Don't be misled by a few average ratings, because audiophiles are notoriously inclined to diss everything but their favorites. I have a good music system, plus a high tech computer with an excellent sound card, and these headphones rock on both.	10
I had a Nook Tablet which was fine. Saw these at Barnes and Noble and picked some up for the kids. The difference between the HD and the table is night and day. The screen is amazing. The addition of Google play makes this an incredible value in a tablet. It also turns it into a Kindle. The kids are busy on all our long car rides. The SD card make it completely expandable. We can watch Netflix with Wi=fi or load the SD card with movies for a road trip. It's under 100 bucks too. GREAT!	10
I purchased this for my wife to use when she speaks to a certain someone each night and puts the phone on the speaker system.  The only probem is that my wife wears one of these all day and was not happy to wear this at home.  I used it a few time when I work on my computer and need help.  Sound quality is fine.  If I had to do over, I might have looked into a wireless. Don't get me wrong, it works fine. It's that I don't really need it with my speaker phones.	10
This product is crap. I followed the instructions to the tiniest detail (I am a very methodical person) and it didn't remove the scratch that my DVD has and it added several more. I read other reviews of people who had a good experience by twisting the instructions, but I am not willing to do that; the manufacturer should know better how to make this product work. Following the instructions, it ruins your CD or DVD even further. Don't wast you time, money and your CD / DVD and take it somewhere where they can buff it.	10
This is a great accessory to use with a webcam on a Laptop computer.  My webcam would not attach and sit securely atop my laptop screen that I use. Because of this I had to position it on a nearby flat surface, but the cord was too short for my needs.  With this Extension Cable I an place cam on suitable site and use the laptop without worrying about the cam falling off, or having to constantly be repositioned.  The cable can also be utilized with other peripheral devices that hook into USB connectors. Very useful device!	10
I already own one of these surge protectors and like it very much.  So when the need arose to purchase a second surge protector I went with another Kensington 62634.  For me the major selling point is the sixteen foot cord.I am very happy I purchased the same surge protector a second time.Today, 11-03-11 I finally became temporarily not lazy, opened the box.  It already has three outlets being used.I ordered another one but returned it when I found a better product by Kensington from another online store.  Of course the new model is much more expensive.	10
If you have a 50 dollar budget for headphones. Stop looking. Add to cart and buy.I'd heard a lot about these throughout my internet travels, and finally had to give in and try them out. I'm so glad I did. The sound exceeds my more expensive, mid-level Klipsch Image One, and I kind of like the way they look too.I'm serious, though. Don't let the looks fool you, the PortaPros are performers! If these are anywhere near your budget, just get them.Note: They're not noise-isolating by any stretch, but the fidelity more than makes up for this.	10
I purchase this item in Amazon. Which I purchase a lot of things in Amazon. This item arrive on time, it is so nice and convenient to have at home or if you are travelling to take it with you in order to charge all the things that we have now days that have to be charge.It is just like the description say. Easy to set up you can put on the wall if you like? Or on the floor. I am living for overseas and it is going to be very convenient item to have.Luz M Brown	10
These webcams are excellent and it is a shame that they no longer make these web cams anymore... You will be able to buy them from Auction sites (e.g., Ebay) or here at Amazon... but most likely, you will have to search endlessly for the Drivers of the item!  When you find the Drivers that you need to run this item... You will find an excellent, high quality webcam and worth the price!  I use webcams for a living (conference calls..etc...) and own top-of-the-line video conferencing cameras... and for the price of these cameras... they are worth it!	10
Glad I didn't need this sooner.  The radio moved on the Super Saver Shipping timeline even with mandatory $10 Standard Shipping.  I could have walked to KY for pick-up in the time standard shipping took.  The vehicle mount antenna ordered same day, standard shipping, from Cricket Ventures, AMZ reseller, arrived four days before the radio.On the other hand, the radio and antenna are superb!  An exceptional package of capabilities, size, and features.  Midland would do well to copy this product architecture across their other families of HT/Mobile products: GMRS/MURS, business band.Buy the radio.  Just don't expect timely delivery.	10
The biggest thing about this telescope is its size, not how big it is but how SMALL it is. Small means easy to carry, and that means you'll be more motivated to take it out and look at things. More importantly you will take it to good 'dark sky' locations. Even with the Meade deluxe tripod this scope is easily carried with one hand, that and a simple set up make it fun to use. The Super Plossil Zoom eyepiece is a great accessory, and the astrostar lets even clutzs like me find cool things to look at.	10
This product does its job once you learn how to properly operate it. I first tried it on my wife's new hp laptop and it worked well. Then I decided to try it on my macbook and it actually pulled the plastic frame away from the screws on the left side leaving a small hole in the frame. I quickly removed it from my macbook. Since it didn't stay on my macbook long it doesn't seem to have caused any permanent damage but buyer beware if you are using this on a macbook. It will damage the frame.	10
For an earbud these are amazing.  The sound quality rivals much larger, heavier and more expensive traditional circumaural earphones.They key is being sure you position them properly.  You'll know when you do because bass notes easily roll off when the seal and orientation of the plug is wrong.  To get the most out of these, compress the foam by rolling it in your fingers and immediately put them in your ears.  Twist gently to seat them and you will be rewarded with good clear sound.The lifetime warranty is a plus.For the price these represent a truly great value	10
I plug it in and put it on my ears.  The sound from the songs I play comes through.  It actually doesn't sit on my head right, but I think it's either because I have an oddly shaped head or because I stretch the cord out really far when I listen and it's like tugging on it a little bit.  Just a little.  Great sound though and they were cheap and arrived quickly.  I drop them a bunch too, so they're pretty sturdy.  Also they are the color of black which reminds me of space, which is cool.	10
I was looking for an upgrade from my tinny sounding JVCs. The sound quality is far superior to the JVC and the music doesn't sound like its coming from a tin can.My only complaint is as one other reviewer mentioned, the comfort. After a little while the phones become painful around the ears. This may be due to the weight or the design. Still, I will use these headphones as long as they last or I cant stand the discomfort any longer.As far as the cost, I bought mine for $36.00 direct from China via EBay. Not bad.	10
"After reading the reviews on here I was hesitant to use the product I had just purchased. But I figured what could I lose - it was already skipping and if this didn't work, I'd just buy a new copy.Well I'm here to tell you that if you plan to use this on anything important, forget it. The CD was left with more scratches than before (the ""protective"" pad actually MAKES scratches WORSE than a paper towel...) and it's just a horrible product. I followed the directions to a T. Thanks Maxell for wasting my money and my time."	10
I'm pleased with the VCR, but it took about an hour to get it set up properly.  Plug &amp; play didn't work.  I finally ended up setting the channels and clock manually, and the initial configuration is relatively  complicated.  I am a little bit disappointed with the remote.  One reason  that I selected a JVC VCR is because I hoped it would interoperate well  with my other JVC components, but the remote is awkward to use with my TV  and DBS.  Overall though, it has a lot of nice features for the money, and  the picture quality is good.	10
I've tried to give Koss praise for these all over the internet where ever I can.These headphone just do not get enough credit.They are small, hold well on your head and sound FANTASTIC.Granted if you want full on studio get big $200 to $400 dollar over the ear headphones, but for a reasonable second place when you are jogging at the gym, these are the ticket.I've bought about 3 or 4 pairs and plan to buy these for the rest of my life unless I hear something better.That hasn't happened in a decade so far....The BEST.  Try them out!	10
Absolutely amazing sound quality for the price.  At first, they may sound a bit bass-heavy compared to other headphones, but once you get used to it, it sounds great.  Powerful and full sound.  I find them super comfortable on the firm setting, but I have a narrow head I think.  The additional foam pads on the temple really help the comfort level.  They fold up fairly small but it's hard to fit them in the leather bag provided.  I wish they came with a hard case for true protection while traveling.A great product which I would definitely buy again.	10
after reading most customer reviews and a few technical reviews on portable headphones the two names with the most positive comments were koss portapro and sennheiser px100 i bought both pairs to do my own comparisons after 1 week i submitted a review giving the portapros a definite edge although not a dramatic one after a full month of listening i no longer use the px100's i hear things on the portapros you don't even notice on the 100's i would like to amend my original opinion to say the portapros are significantly better and provide a lifetime warranty	10
I have had such a great time learning to use this camera and taking photos. I used it immediately, switching the dial to automatic and letting it do everything. It was exactly like a point and shoot. But when I learned how to adjust aperture and shutter speed, I took even better photos. I highly recommend this camera. I took it to Alaska in August and people said how beautiful and crisp my photos were. If you have the money, also invest in a telefoto lens. Sometimes 80mm just isn't long enough. But you can always add that later.	10
i bought my mic from crazyfrog, not expecting that great of a mic due to the price. it shipped very fast, and i recieved it in perfect condition. it works just as well as, if not better than, my mic that came with an iphone. it works great with my ipod touch 2nd generation mc model. i would strongly advise anyone to buy this who's looking for a high quality mic at a low price. dont let those bad reviews scare you!! i dont know about the quality from other sellers, but crazyfrog delivered mine in perfect condition. great buy.	10
I'm actually a bit shocked. I've been using this cassette adapter for the past two years. The sound quality is good, although you can hear some typical cassette noise at higher volumes. The cassette adapter itself is fairly quiet as well. In cold weather, it sometimes sticks a bit. But overall, it has worked quite well. I don't leave my mp3 player in the car, so the stereo cable saw quite a bit of abuse from daily bouts of plugging and unplugging. It managed to last 2 years, which is excellent considering how quickly 8mm stereo cables can develop shorts.	10
Not many things you can buy for $10 anymore.. but this is definitely worth the small investment.The headset is comfortable, has a good microphone/earpiece and is almost unnoticeable after a few minutes of use.  Make sure you have a phone with a good belt clip that isn't too heavy to carry around.  The only downside to the headset is that there is no volume control and no mute button, so it's best to get a phone that has these functions in the phone itself.  I use it with a couple of different cordless phones and it performs flawlessly with both.	10
"I've been using these for many years, mostly for playing music during workouts.  I am a fan of really high end headphones (Sennheiser 595s) and, although my Koss phones aren't quite up there with them, they really do satisfy.  Great bass, great presence and you could run over them with a car and they'd still work.  When I bought these (more than ten years ago) the dealer (whom I trusted) said ""these are the best.""  He was absolutely right.By the way, I recently listened to the headphones currently marketed as Koss Porta Pros.  Happily, Koss hasn't changed a thing.Tom Hurley"	10
I recently purchased a pair of the Koss R80 and all I can say is they have a very nice clean sound and despite what people have said about build quality they seamed decently built for a pair of $34 dollar head phones. The problem is the cord was defective on both pairs I ordered (I had to replace the first pair), the right channel would cut in and out. I wish I could say that all the negative review it gets are unwarranted but I can't. I would avoid the Koss R-line of head phones and look else where.	10
These headphones are a must buy. They are very comfortable and have really good sound. I use them for music, games, movies, and tv shows that I play on my computer and the sound is terrific. They have just the right amount of bass, and are really good for games especially. I would recommend these headphones to anyone. In order for these headphones to last they have to be taken care of really carefully because the plastic that holds the cups on will crack if you're careless. Overall, these headphones are a great purchase and I will buy these again.	10
i've been buying these for over 10 years now.  this is my third pair.  no, they are not crappy.  i traveled to less than favorable places under less than favorable conditions and beat the ever living crap out of them.  a product can only make it so far.  i don't baby my stuff.  having said all that, i have no regrets.  i love these, they are so loud you can set them on the table in a room and still hear them on full blast.  i will continue to buy this headset even when the next ones break.  LOVE THESE	10
This is the worst headset I have ever owned. I bought so many of them over the years I don't remember anymore how many went bad. At least 10. The reason I keep buying them is because all other manufacturer headsets don't work well with a Uniden cordless phone. Uniden requires a specific impedance, otherwise voice quality is not good.Calling Uniden is worthless. They are of no help.I actually think they design the tip of the connector to break because each one has stopped working properly where the wire connects to the 2.5mm plug.I'm not buying anymore Uniden phones or headsets.	10
I bought this pack specifically because each tape is 8 hrs long. This length is useful for recording sports programs especially that tend to run pretty long.The quality of the picture is still pretty good even at 8 hrs. So far I have had no problems with these tapes. I suggest cleaning the tape deck once in awhile to prevent your recordings from having that annoying picture noise.I got these at a good price(just under seven bucks) on Amazon. VHS tapes are difficult to find nowadays in a regular store so I am glad I can still purchase these on Amazon.	10
"In the past, Keebler was the maker of ""Thin Mints"" for the Girl Scouts of America.After Keebler lost the license to make GSCs, they bought Little Brownie Bakers, one of the 2 remaining licensees.So, rest asured, these are a great way to get your fix between fundraisers.Remember, broken cookies and crumbs have no calories, so it's OKay to subscribe-n-save a 6-pack of these every month, right?*Edited 2011-03-01 to correct Keebler licensee status based on comments*"	11
"Excellent product, that would be a good ""just because"" gift to almost anyone you care about.Seniors, college kids, or anyone who might need a bit of comfort food.  Not sure if it can easily be sent to the troop's, but I am sure it would be welcome.I first found this product on a film set, when it turned up at a craft service table on a late-night shoot.It was a hit,and I have been hooked ever since.  Outstanding product!"	11
"Whenever I'm stuck for a gift for my wife, nothing beats 2 1/2 pounds of Almond Roca. And I'll give her more credit: much as she loves this toffee treat, she has one for dessert after dinner, and that's it. If I were to sit down with this, it wouldn't last a week. If you've never tried Almond Roca, but love toffee, then you've got to get the original ""mini"" chocolate and nut covered toffee. If they only sold self-control!"	11
I have been ordering this almond flour for years.  It is a great quality.  I get consistent, delicious baked goods.However, the price has been really creeping up over the years.  I'm not sure if that's a supply and demand issue?  It feels like it's more of a &#34;now that we realize people really want it we can charge more&#34; issue.I'm still buying it, but if the price goes up much more, I might have to search other brands for alternatives.	11
This hubby's favorite brand of coffee as it's rich tasting and easy to use. He was delighted to find this at Amazon as this type of coffee filter/pod seems to have disappeared from local grocery shelves.Things he likes best:1.  Rich coffee flavor2.  Easy to use in the morning and it saves time. Good for when you are sleepy too and need a little extra help. :-)3.  Great for taking on vacation as this pod works in most hotel/motel coffee pots.Recommend.	11
This is the whitest drink ever!  If you've never tried milk before, then you should try it, its awesome!  It can give you an instant moustache too!  You just pour it in a glass and drink it!  If you like a browner drink, you can add bosco!  If you spill it on the floor, your cats will immediately walk through it! I never put so many exclamation marks in a review, so you know its good!  I will buy milk again!	11
Really High in salt (3,250 mg/box) and a third of the calories are from FAT.  The package states that it contains less than 0.5% of MSG, etc....again with the neurotoxins!!!  The flavor is not really cheesy as you'd expect from the hype on the box.  The potatoes do remain firm though.  It's hard to describe the flavor.  Creamy yet artificial tasting. No, I really must NOT be sucked into buying these awful scalloped potatoes again.  Buy it at your own risk.	11
Now, I LOVE my coffee, and I enjoy a cup every now and then.  However, when when I want a cup of coffee, and I'm more conscious of not getting all the caffeine, this is a SUPER delicious alternative.  I find a bit more than the teaspoon of this natural chicory/malt beverage, gives me a medium coffee taste.  I've served it to visitors, and they never noticed a difference.  Going the healthier route, well, you can't lose with this product in your cabinet.	11
"I've been eating Jing Jing Jahe for the past 15 years, even taking some with me when traveling in Indonesia, where it is manufactured.  When you first put a candy in your mouth, you might wonder where the ginger heat is, but don't worry.  After a few minutes your mouth will be enveloped with the most wonderful ginger taste you'll ever experience.  This chewy candy is not for those who do not like ""hot"" foods, but for ginger affecionados, it's a wonderful treat."	11
This stuff is very hot! It will burn your face off! It also has a sort of Habenaro pepper flavor to it. I love it when my friends come over and find this stuff. They all think they can handle it but boy are they in for a surprise! I don't use it often as it doesn't seem to have much of a flavor. If &#34;Melt Your Mouth&#34; could be a flavor, that's what this would be! You don't need but a few drops.	11
One downside of a Senseo machine, is that unless you want an espresso size cup of coffee, you need to make 2 cups, which means you need two pods, at around 5.69 and bag for 18 pods, it can get pricey. The dark roast solves the problem. You put one in, and you make two cups! Before I found the Senseo, I was an average folgers, yuban mild coffee drinking type. I have the value pack on amazon grocery as a subscription...works out great!!	11
The dark roast is good coffee.  Never liked the other flavors.  Well, the decaf is OK.  Super Saver Subscription brings price down to about $0.22 per cup of coffee.  And Senseo means it's always fresh.  Occasionally one pod in a pack will have ripped open (in transit, or from manufacturer).  This makes a mess of the other pods and will result in the occasional extra gritty bits in your coffee.  Call Senseo if this happens, and they'll send you a coupon for another bag.	11
This spice is very difficult to find and very expensive for what you get... but... you must get it!  A little goes a long ways.  It has a really unique flavor... kind of like celery and red pepper and garlic with a nice bite of heat that doesn't burn.  It is very good to sprinkle on Organic, Non-GMO Heirloom Popcorn popped the good old fashioned way and on Home Made potato chips... the uses for this spice are only limited to the chef's imagination.	11
I'll likely try to buy this local next time, because it is pricey, but the cost is worth it.  I used to think all molasses was the same, but, like honey or peanut butter, there is a difference.  this has the best taste.  I use it for my shake (handful of almonds, an apple or banana, flaxseed, tablespoon of molasses and some whey protein powder and a little soy milk) for an after-workout snack, but plan to try it in cooked dishes as well.	11
The nutrition profile on this line of bars was great!  High protein and fiber, low fat, not excessively sweet, very satisfying for the modest calories. It became my go-to breakfast and I haven't yet found a replacement.It was always hard to find them cheap, and right when Costco started offering them, Kashi decides to discontinue them.  Maybe the product would have done better with the word &#34;protein&#34; in the name.  Let's hope they will be adding something new that has a similar nutrition profile.	11
This is a mix of Stevia, Xylitol, and something called Rebaudiana extract.  I haven't tried other Stevia products but this does have a slightly bitter aftertaste when taken straight.  Also, it does clump in the packet.  On the plus side I haven't had the, er, alimentary issues I've had with straight Xylitol.I'm glad I tried this, but I'm not planning to keep using it.  I don't think it's significantly different from using honey as a sweetener - but that's not what I want for coffee!	11
This the first time I've tried Utz chips.  Never heard of them before.  Wow!  They are delicious.  I haven't tried all the flavors yet -- still working my way through them.  But, I really like the crab flavored ones.  I wasn't sure what they'd be like, but they taste like Old Bay crab boil seasoning (which I really like).  I will definitely reorder these.  Plus you can't beat the price per pack when you compare to what you get out of the office vending machine.	11
Oh, this was heaven at first bite!  It is the exact cheese that Kraft uses in their little boxes of macaroni and cheese.  I never liked the little noodles they used though.  It is so delicious with regular (Anna's) elbows.  Just add a touch of vegetable oil, a touch of milk and this powdered cheddar with a pinch of salt.  I have since purchased a different brand of powdered cheddar and it is no match to this brand.  I will buy this brand from now on.	11
I generally do not like powdered creamers but Coffee Mate has the best tasting creamer!! The Vanilla is awesome but the Vanilla Caramel is my absolute favorite!!! It has a wonderful smooth taste and the best thing is that it is Sugar-free!!! Thank you Coffee Mate! I drink a lot of tea and I use it in my teas all the time. It offers a sweet taste to my tea where I do not have to use a lot of sweetener. I will be purchasing more!!!	11
"A sample of these Van Houtte ""French Vanilla K-Cups"" were included with my Keurig B-40 B40 Elite Gourmet Single-Cup Home-Brewing System and it was fairly disappointing to me. This seems to be a ""hit-or-miss"" flavor since there are so many positive reviews and a scattering of those who, like me, don't like it.When made on the ""Large Cup"" setting, the French Vanilla flavor was weak and slightly artificial tasting. It isn't really bad or undrinkable, but I will not be buying this flavor in the future.CFH"	11
Since reading the other reviews, I decided to try this extra virgin olive oil.  It is subtle and delicious; I keep it in conjunction with another that has a more pronounced olive flavor.  But I can't say enough good things about this seller.  The packaging is done so well, I don't think anything could destroy the contents.  And this is the fastest shipping ever.  I will be visiting Super Olive just to see what else they carry because I'd like to do more business with them.	11
I love this product.  It is rich tasting, and full of healthy goodness.  It is USDA Certified Organic so you don't have to worry about pesticide contamination or any of the nasty HFC (High Fructose Corn Syrup} that most other 'honey' is polluted with. This is pure raw honey with all the goodness you would expect from a great natural product.  I use it to sweeten my coffee/tea, put on toast or bagels, sweeten oat meal... etc. etc.  It might just be the worlds most perfect food.	11
Excellent decaf that can go toe-to-toe with some caffeinated coffees. Rich tasting with no bitterness. A must purchase if you have a Senseo and want to go decaf.I just wish they would offer more options for decaf, such as some different flavored coffees (hazelnut in particular). As it stands, this is the one and only decaf offering from Senseo. I have to make my own pods if I want something different (not hard to do, and cheaper, but I do like the convenience of the pre-made pods).	11
This product has been around for decades and stood the test of time. I ate them as a kid, my children ate them growing up, and now my granddaughter asks for this when she wants a snack at my house. These taste great and are relatively healthy for a snack cracker. 5 crackers have only 80 calories, 1g saturated fat, 105 mg sodium, and 1g sugar.Shop for price. I buy 15 stay fresh packs totaling 56.5 oz (3 lb 8.5 oz) at my local Costco for 7.99	11
I never got around to trying to bake with these because I just used them as a snack rather than regular chips or sweets.  I think these would be great in trail mix or just plain as I've been eating them.  I don't eat massive quantities of them, so I'm not concerned about the coconut oil or the small amount of sugar added.  I just eat them to take the edge off hunger sometimes between meals.  Honeyville does sell freeze-dried bananas though if you're concerned about additives.	11
I mean this stuff was roasted how long ago? A far lesser coffee roasted a couple of days ago is going to taste a whole lot better. At $50 per pound, what you're tasting is justification for spending the money. What you should do, if you have the money for this sort of coffee, is buy a coffee roaster and start getting good green beans (including Jamaican Blue Mountain) and roasting them fresh yourself. The folks at Sweet Maria's have all the info you need to get started.	11
Yes, this pepper condiment won't leave you crawling to bed from the bathroom. It's about adding a range of flavors to contrast whatever it is you're cooking, not committing seppuku by hot pepper. If you're idea of a good pepper sauce is one that leaves you vomiting flames from both ends, by all means please avoid Shichimi Togarashi. If you want an authentic flavor enhancer from Japan that compliments a meal, this should be on your table next to the soy sauce and that creepy Kewpie Brand Mayo.	11
I do not mean the milk. It has been known for a long time.  However, I have discovered that adding a little milk to coffee produces an unexpected improvement.  This is not obvious.  While milk and coffee are both liquids, they have quite different properties.  Milk is light in color, usually cold, and is the product of animals.  Coffee is dark, hot, and is a plant product.  I am convinced that if the millions of coffee drinkers knew about milk, they would become eager consumers.  Venture capital anyone?	11
"I try to eliminate sugar from my diet in any way that I can and I keep this one on my pantry shelf!  This is a tasty chocolate addition to your coffee, but like others have said, expect a ""hot chocolate"" type of flavor, rather than a mocha.  This, when combined with a packet of stevia in my coffee, is perfect for me.  It is also one of the few powder creamers that I can use at its recommended serving size and feel satisfied.  This is a keeper!"	11
Did you know that the Irish - *not* the English - are per capita the world's highest consumers of tea? No wonder, then, that there is a breakfast blend named for them; although Irish Breakfast is actually strong enough to be a great pick-me-up throughout the day. Traditionally, it consists primarily of teas from Ceylon (Sri Lanka) and the state of Assam in northeastern India. Irish Breakfast has an intricately full-bodied, malty, floral aroma and goes particularly well with milk (or cream, but real milk is preferable). Enjoy!	11
I could certainly go on for more than 20 words about how much I hated this coffee.  Fortunately I didn't pay for it because it came with my machine as a sampler.  Yuck!  It doesn't taste like good coffee and it doesn't taste like French Vanilla.  Point blank I couldn't even finish the cup and had to pour it down the drain.  The aftertaste is even worse.  I don't understand how anyone could give this a positive review but I guess it's all a matter of individual preference.	11
I LOVE rice dishes including many of this brands (Knorr) offerings.I love the taco rice and the teriyaki rice dishes are my favorites.I like Brocolli cheese soup and I thought &#34;THIS IS GOING TO BE GREAT!&#34;BOY WAS I WRONG. this was extremely bland. Not much flavor at all. This lookedAnd tasted like plain rice and vermicelli with tiny little bits of broccoli in it.There was no taste of cheese nor the color of cheddar of cheese about it.If you like broccoli cheddar keep looking because THIS ISN'T IT!	11
I have a lot of pain issues and have a very hard time getting to sleep, don't want to take drugs to go to sleep and with this tea I don't have to.  It really works, one bag relaxes me enough to drift off to sleep and on those nights I'm having a lot of problems two bags just knocks me out.  It has a lot of really potent herbal extracts that are strong such as Valerian, Skullcap and those two together will really relax you.  Highly recommend.	11
We really like these &#34;meat&#34; balls--they are good with or without sauce.  I would order more if the price could somehow be lower--I used to purchase by the case from a local health food store not that long ago for considerably less (unfortunately they closed).  They are now available in our local grocery store--the per can cost is considerably less than when I purchase by the case.  If this could be reevaluated, you would definitely have a faithful (and repeat) customer for these and other canned vegetarian products.	11
My whole family loves this sauce. I use it primarily to recreate a dish we had in Maui. It adds a wonderful sweet and spicy flavor to just about any sauce. Service on this order was spectacular. Several bottles arrived broken and replacements were received within days. Amazon service was fast, easy and reliable. I love Amazon. Also, there are many recipes that you can look up using this sauce that a very good. It goes spectaculary with coconut milk, vegetables, chicken or shrimp and pasta. We love it.	11
I am very impressed. I saw the reviews and just had to try some, the reviews for this tea are incredible. The teabags do not have tags or strings, which is a bummer, but the taste of the tea makes you forget about that little detail. It just has this strong, smooth flavor, yet not bitter... This is some of the best tea I've tried. I want to get it in decaf too so I can drink it in the evening without the caffeine keeping me awake. Highly recommend.	11
I ordered 6 on scribe and save but received only 1. The box was squashed since it was packed with numerous heavy items in a really big box.I won't know until I receive my credit card how I was charged, but it should be free as far as I'm concerned since I did not get what I ordered and the website refused to let me schedule a return.  At least I should be charged 1/6th of what the subscribe and save price was.The tea inside the package is undamaged.	11
I grabbed a handful of Texas Pete sauce packets at the Atlanta Airport while on a layover.  I laughed when I noticed where it was made, but tried it anyway.  It is not as vinegary as Tabasco, nor as spicy.  I've enjoyed it, slathered liberally, on burgers and sandwiches.It is not a sauce to clear your sinuses out, but it has a good flavor.  I enjoy all types of hot sauces, from mild to wild, and this is a good one.  Give it a try if you see it.	11
I have this bad habit where I think I need three portions of sugar in my coffee every morning. By that I mean, no matter the size of the cube, packet, spoon, whatever, I end up putting three of them in my cup without thinking. You can imagine how disgustingly sweet that makes things sometimes, but I just do it without thinking. Ordering my sugar in packets like this just helps me keep the sugar added a little lower than I normally would, so they're perfect for my needs!	11
This is a family favorite. One thing that we like to do is to cook up some additional barley and add it to the soup, to give even more &#34;pop&#34; to the barley taste.The taste is hearty, the soup thick. The downside? Like many canned goods, there is way too much sodium (29% of the daily value). On the positive side, bad fat and cholesterol are low. Some dietary fiber. . .Overall, a good taste.In the end, despite some issues, my family enjoys a meal based on this product.	11
I have been buying this at a local market but they don't always have it.  I am so glad I found it on amazon.  This is by far the best seasoning for steaks and roasts.  I have used other products before, but when I tried this, nothing compares.  I do not use anything else as this gives the best flavor to meats.  Have not tried it on fish or poultry yet but I am sure it would be just as good.  You will not be disappointed with this product.  Excellent!!	11
Several weeks ago I discovered Izze fruit drinks starting with the Blackberry variety. It was so good I tried the Pomegranate. That was good too, so now I have a four-pack of the Clementine variety. It tastes like a weak orange soda with a good sharp tartness. I like it much better than the typical orange soda pop and it's made with 70% fruit juices and no added sugars. It's just like having a slightly carbonated fruit juice rather than darkly-colored sugar water. That's my kind of drink. Excellent.Gary Peterson	11
I use carob powder in every recipe that calls for cocoa.  I especially love it in my morning protein shake that I make with hempseeds, hemp protein, chia seeds and almond milk.I rated it 4 stars instead of 5 because it doesn't taste any different to me than carob that is dark roasted.  I thought it would have a less &#34;carob&#34; flavor, but that's not the case.  But it is good tasting.  I do prefer raw carob, although it is too expensive, so I will continue to buy the light roast.	11
After trying NuNaturals NuStevia, this one tastes almost like real sugar! It is actually the closest to the real thing among the ones I've tried. I will buy this brand again but of course will try other brands to see if I like it better than this. If I have to rate the sugar taste similarity (10 being exactly the same as sugar), I would say:NuNaturals - 5Stevita Supreme - 7.5Also, the other thing I like about this brand, it is not like powder powder. It is kinda crystallized like sugar.	11
I've had nothing but wonderful experiences with this lotion over the years. At times it IS the only lotion that can handle super tough dry skin issues on faces (and scalp for you men) while being super gentle. Recently recommended it to someone who used it on his face after shaving and said it stung horribly. I could see the redness reaction. Within a couple of weeks this settled down, but I was surprised at the initial reaction. Speaks to the necessity of a regular moisturizing regime for anyone, I suppose.	11
This popcorn does pop up well with very few hulls.  However, it has little to no butter flavor and has a strange taste that I couldn't grow accustomed to.  I ate three boxes, trying to convince myself that the flavor would grow on me, before deciding that I was never going to get used to it and the calories weren't worth it.  I added butter, flavorings, parmesan cheese, but no luck. Too bad you can't return unused boxes!I ended up giving the rest of it away.  A very expensive taste test!	11
Its a Kashi bar. healthy, good ingredients yadda yadda yadda.It has a fancy name too ! 'Dark Mocha Almond'.Was pretty excited about these. Orded a 6 pack of 6 bars each and i now have 36 coffee flavored coffee bars.A good description for these would be coffee granola bars because they taste just like that. The little chunks of dark chocolate are not too sweet and with the rest of the oatmeal they have a very distinct coffee flavor to the entire thing.I liked it. but was expecting something more 'chocolately'.	11
"I have absolutely no experience with Indian food, but when I saw these entrees in a local discount store, I decided to try them, because I needed a quick dinner that night.I microwaved them for myself and my partner that night, and, hey, they were GOOD! We were both surprised that we liked the flavor of the cheese, peas, etc., considering that this was ""prepared"" food.This was a good introduction to Indian cuisine, and now I'm ready to try other flavors of this brand. After that, maybe an Indian restaurant? ;)"	11
I bought this locally and had a cup tonight.....I found that it did indeed relax me, so that impressed me immediately!  Sadly, though, I must be allergic to one or more ingredients as i began feeling some mild wheezing and had to take an allergy pill.  I think it may be the lavender but I'm not sure if it is anything more.  If you have seasonal allergies, be careful with the herbs that are in the same family as seasonal weeds.  I wish I wasn't allergic...it seems like an awesome blend.	11
I've noticed more and more large lumps of fat arriving in these cans than used to be the case. The chicken meat is also more broken up than it used to be. That said, it still makes a damned fine sandwich or, if you want to get really creative, you can do what I do: put it in a pan with ginger beer, sriracha, garlic, soy sauce, lime juice, onions and green herbs to taste. Reduce to a thick sauce and serve on a wrap with lettuce. Yay thai chicken wrap!	11
Club crackers have arrived FRESH, in good shape at less than twelve bucks - a good deal! It's getting too hot to bake bread at home so crackers are on the summer menu. The hors d'oeuvres style goodies on crackers along side salads have been a hit with the family as a change of pace. The teens enjoy making peanut butter and jelly whip for a sweet cracker treats. It never fails that good old cheese and crackers are TV treats too. All-in-all versatility and variety relatively on the cheap :)	11
My coworker had the Vanilla Caramel Sugar-Free Coffee-mate and we went through the two bottles and needed more.  Like regular Coffee-mate, this is creamy in the coffee.  However, it adds a nice Vanilla Caramel flavor without the added sugar of other flavored creamers.  As with most sugar-free items, it makes up for the lake of sugar with extra fat calories.  At 30 calories per tablespoon, it is not for dieters.  However, I rarely use a tablespoon, a teaspoon is usually enough for the occasional flavor boost to my morning cup of java.	11
This is now one of my favorites.  Had it for lunch as a soup.  I do think that the Tasty Bite portions are on the small size for claiming two servings (unless you're serving it with other food items) but they're always just the right amount to fill me up.  This one in particular I found to be extremely filling.  Tastes just like a mildly spicy beef chili without the beef.  Tofu and an extra can of kidney beans stirred into the mix could easily make this a filling meal for four.	11
Years ago I wrote a review singing the praises of Smooth Move, which I'd drunk for years. But two different doctors told me it probably wasn't a good idea to drink it. One reason is that it stains your colon. So when you have a colonoscopy, it's more difficult for the doctor to see what's going on in there. Also, it's a stimulant laxative, which can cause problems with regular use. I now take Miralax, which works perfectly, and the doctor says I can take as much of that as I want.	11
I bought this tea because of the wonderful reviews on Amazon.  I love reading up before purchasing.  I tried it from my local health food store first to make sure I liked the taste.  I really enjoyed it so I purchased from Amazon when I couldn't find it at the stores.  Imagine my surprise that it was cheaper to purchase it off amazon.  This is not always the case but happily for me this time it worked out.  I got six boxes so I can clean my liver to my hearts content!	11
"i've tried many calming & bedtime teas & none of them work for me, this is no exception. maybe i'm just immune to the ingredients???  i don't know. or perhaps i am just WAY too high strung & i need a triple dose or something.  all i know is it didn't help me fall asleep the two or three times i tried it.  and i don't like the taste of valerian, so while this blend really isn't that bad compared to some others i've tried it is ""not my cup of tea""."	11
My husband is a gummy candy fanatic. I had bought this in the hopes of finding a new brand he enjoyed but neither of us were all that thrilled with this one. Don't get me wrong, it wasn't horrible by any means and we did eventually finish the bag, but we didn't love it enough to want to pay $6 for more. If you want to try something new, I would definitely recommend this but I think you can find much cheaper gummy candy around that taste the same if not better.	11
Licorice is my favorite candy, and it promotes good digestion. Since I have some digestive issues, I eat licorice on a regular basis. I've tried basically every brand. I bought this because it's advertised as soft licorice. However, it is the same consistency as the cheapest stuff on the grocery store shelf; the difference is that this has a stronger flavor. The flavor is nice. The consistency and texture is terrible. I bought another package hoping the first was just old/stale, but the next package was the same. I threw away both packages.	11
I was yearning for collards/turnip greens and couldn't justify buying a hunk of ham for just 2 people. So, I thought I'd try this.........it's just wonderful! Smokey and not terribly salty.....great meaty flavor ( although  it's mostly vegetable). My family are MSG sensitive, so I'm careful, but this has none added. And BOY! Did it make a difference! Can't wait to make split pea soup, and purple hull peas, and.....We stirred some into canned brown beans and they were SO much better! It doesn't take much, either........ great stuff. Well worth the $12.00.	11
This wheat gluten was processed on equipment that also processes peanuts, tree nuts, eggs, and soy.It would be really nice if Amazon required allergen statements on grocery items since its policy is that it does not allow returns on groceries.I don't really like hurting a product's ratings, but the vendor can certainly (and SHOULD) include this sort of critical information about the product's contents. All you have to do is upload a photo of the label.Anyhow, if you have severe food allergies to these substances, be forewarned. This isn't the product for you.	11
What a discovery. This is a natural fruit booster that is great on everything from applesto watermelon. Makes a great rib rub, for rimming a margarita, on fish, pork, corn onthe cob, veggie, and in a crab pot or with shrimp. Just an amazing chili lime flavor thatperks up just about anything you can imagine.This is a handy way to add spice where a hot sauce wouldn't work. A 1/10 on the heatscale, nobody is going to complain about this setting them on fire. Available just abouteverywhere at your local superstore for about $1.50.	11
I have ordered Barry's Irish Tea bags in the green box before and loved them, so I decided to try the Barry's Gold Blend tea bags in the red box.  These are just as good!  I love good full bodied tea.  My mother was from england and our family has always enjoyed a good cup of hot tea with milk.  Not just any tea, mind you!  It has to be a very strong bodied, tea.  Barry's is excellent and I appreciate it that Amazon.com carries this tea and at an affordable price too!  :)	11
These are good granola bars.  We buy them at the grocery store but are way cheaper here.  The only problem is sometimes they get very hard (the grocery store ones are softer).  I'm not sure if that's from shipping here in a cold climate or what.  Also, the expiration date can be very close.  I was getting low on the bars and then ordered more and realized the expirate date is coming up in a few weeks when the last case had a later date.  So it makes me wonder how fresh these are.	11
This chicken noodle soup has a nice flavorful stock and good sized chunks of carrot, cellary and the chicken. The noodles do a great job of retaining the stock for flavorful bites much better than the classic flat noodles.The can is a good size and a meal unto itself and is easily split into two portions. If you do decide to eat the entire can though it will hit you for 68% of your daily sodium; though that is a common pitfall of a good chicken stock and cutting the sodium cuts the flavor.	11
Chicory gives this coffee its rich taste, dark color and syrupy body -- I guess, although no other chicory-cut coffee I've ever tasted was this good. Although this coffee tastes very strong and robust, I suspect it has less caffeine than the straight stuff; at least, I've been able to drink a lot of it without getting the jitters.I usually buy mine for some ridiculously low price at an Asian market, but lately they've been out of stock. Anyone know why Asian markets carry this product? I wonder if there's an interesting story behind that...	11
Why would a huge plastic container of round cheese balls be selling for over 20 dollars?  Are you kidding me?  And the worst part is that the regular cheese curls are a thousand times crunchier and tastier anyway.  Cheese balls taste rather hard and lack the cheesy flavor in comparison to the actual curls.  Either way expect cheese stains all over your hands, and especially the furniture and Nintendo equipment (including TV and Wii remotes) in the living room.  A product that I fail to see why anyone would consider purchasing considering the many flaws.	11
This is actually the best coffee-mate there is when you consider it has less tan one gram of fat, less than one gram of carbohydrates and &#34;0&#34; sugars in it.  Just check out the fat free and sugar free flavored coffee-mates and you'll be shocked to find they have twice the fat, carbohydrates and sugars then  just the regular old  coffee-mate, Lol.Besides I don't want flavors in my coffee to mask the coffee flavor,  I like the taste of deep robust coffee and this regular coffee mate gives me that creamy coffee flavor I like.	11
While I am sure this is bad for you, it is one of my favorite comfort foods, mostly because it is easy to make and has a great flavor.I do not care for the other flavors of Bowl Appetit because I do not find them half as flavorful as this one.  This is really high in salt (50 pct of your daily intake) so better go light on salty items on days you eat it.All you need to make it is water, a utensil for stirring, and a microwave.  Can't get much easier than that!	11
"""Erythritol"" has become our sugar substitute of choice since I became diabetic a few months ago. In crystal form, it seems about 70% as sweet as regular sugar. My wife uses a little bit of added sugar to bring the sweetness up for the rest of the family in things that need it, but I am happy with it as a one-to-one replacement for sugar in most things.I have not noticed any glycemic impact to my blood sugar or ""laxative"" effects seen with other sugar alcohol sweeteners (which is a very important consideration :-)Highly recommended!"	11
After reading some of the reviews here, I decided to try a single box from the grocery store before investing in 6 boxes of 16 bags.  Next time, I'll buy in bulk!  I love ginger, and find that I don't need to sweeten this tea (unusual for me).  I don't find it intense, as some reviewers do; but if I did, it would be easy to tone it down by simply adding additional water or steeping for less time.  This delicious tea, which incidentally soothes my persistent heartburn, has become a nightly routine for me.	11
"O.k., I'm going to offer a counterpoint to all the positive reviews.  I did not like this hot sauce, and I like hot sauce!  This may be good in chili (and I will try it there as soon as I get a chance), but it is not a general hot sauce for your eggs, soup, sandwiches, whatever.It is very thick and has the consistency of tomato paste.  The heat is derived from peppers and ""pepper extracts"" (read: capsaicin).If you want flavorful heat you can use everywhere, try somewhere else.  I recommend Melinda's Naga Jolokia for one."	11
These are larege tea bags, with about twice as much in them as in Alvita or Seelect fennel tea bags.  When I brewed up a cup according to the instructions, it was just too strong for my taste.  Maybe you like your tea strong or need it that way for your condition.  After trying it several times, I concluded it was just too much for me and went back to other brands.  They leave me feeling much better than this does.  For those who would need or enjoy it, I'm sure it would be very good.	11
You can compare it to unsweetened black tea, but palpable and soothing.  It is one of nature's best blood purifiers in addition to being great for women anytime.  It's great year round and for flu season, and you can ice it too.  Sweeten it up with a bag of chamomile or red clover. Spearmint & peppermint tea compliment it well too -- or add value to that flavored stuff from the supermarket w/this.You can drink this like water and I can't say enough about how good this tea is for well being, you'll probably instantly feel better.	11
I have a Hamilton Beach On the Go one cup brewer.  These pods are perfect for it.  I like the coffee.  It is not as bold as I had expected, but I do like it.  I went from needing cream and sugar in coffee (because I never measured properly and ended up with either too strong or weak coffee) to being able to drink these black.  Wish there was more consistency in the price.  I have to watch it all the time to see whether or not it will be going back to a reasonable price (~$25).	11
Never thought I'd be reviewing peppercorn! Ever! Heck, I never thought I'd be reading reviews of peppercorn before I buy it but I must say, not only is this peppercorn EXTREMELY FRESH, it has actually shown me what peppercorn should taste like. Until now, I might as well have not bothered. It was disgusting dust I was crushing all over my food, apparently because the Spicy World Peppercorn iS DELICIOUS - the reviews are not kidding. You get a heart-felt 5 star from me, baby! Packaging was awesome and it arrived on time too! Thank you :)!	11
"After googling these and seeing that some people are obsessed with the arrowroot variety, I thought I would give them a try. They taste basically like graham crackers or maybe animal crackers with strong taste of honey. It's great that they have no trans fats, minimal chemical ingredients, are mostly organic, and ""non-profit""; but they're nothing to get excited about. The hard texture is a pro/con in that it forces you to eat carefully, and limits your desire to gorge. These are good non-lethal commercial cookies, but like all commerical cookies are lacking in nutrition and taste."	11
It is hard to believe these are sugar free. They are so good. They are buttery and rich tasting and a serving is 8 cookies of 130 calories. That is so filling and yet still keeps you on whatever plan you are following.I have tried many of the flavors of these cookies and not found one to be bad or have an aftertaste. This one is my all time favorite. You will not be disappointed. In my town they are usually $3.99 a pack so this is a fantastic deal.They come with a long expiration date also.	11
I got this to use in a bread recipe that calls for powdered milk. I've tried the recipe with and without powdered milk and the recipe is serious: powdered milk really helps the rise. This product works as well as the popular (and way more expensive) brand of non-instant I'd been using, and I will definitely be purchasing this brand again when I run out. It tastes good as well in uses such as milk gravy and from-scratch macaroni & cheese, though it is, again, not instant--so it doesn't dissolve the same way. Lumps must be carefully attended.	11
Southern born and never had any asian food until I joined the Army. Got married and my in-laws grew up on Japanese food. Needless to say within a short amount of time I was introduced to Siracha which I immediatley fell in love with. I was no means a virgin to hot sauce but this stuff rates up there with some of the best. It is now a staple in our house. We use it with egg rolls, gyozas, ramen mixed with soy sauce. Trust be you wont regret buying this stuff no matter where you are from.	11
I have accidentally used the completely open spoon side rather than the sprinkle side now twice.  It's kind of annoying because lots of garlic pours out quickly.  I eventually taped that side down so I wouldn't have any more unhappy accidents.The product taste is fine for cooking (I mean, it's powdered garlic we're talking about here not fresh - there is going to be a difference in flavor for sure).The size is very large and you may want to consider pouring this into a smaller container if you're using it a lot or have a limited spice area.	11
A true vanilla-holic I use this vanilla every day.  I don't even measure I just dump it in.  Love the flavor, aroma, and bean flecks.  I use it in place of vanilla extract all the time. This is a fantastic price for a great quantity. I will be purchasing this again as I'm sure to run out at the speed I'm using it.  Its more of a syrup than a paste really, but it exchanges for extract beautifully.  I usually just take out a bit of sugar from whatever I'm using it in as the paste does contain sugar.	11
You can't beat the price. Even if you're used to buying the small 4 oz. jars of Fleischmann's for less than $5, this is a whole Lb. for just $7.25! It does require proofing, so it's not a substitute for recipes that require &#34;Rapid Rise&#34; yeast, but it's fresh (I got a batch produced in 04/13 in 08/13) and it's got a two year shelf-life. I've used quite a bit of it so far and I haven't noticed any delay in rising time, or any difference in flavor from what I was using before. It's worth trying for sure.	11
I hesitated but then still decided for this to be the only product that I ever took a star from for being too good. Too good to the point of being addictive. I know, sugar can be addictive anyway. But this chewy candy, provided you like the taste of condensed milk, is insanely so. If they ever produce a version with stevia or xylitol to make it less unhealthy, I'll give it ten stars.In the meantime, you might also want to check outHigh Concentrated Milk Hard Candy (Japanese Import). The hard candy consistency takes some of the addictiveness away.	11
I purchased Amaranth because of the health benefits.  Unlike the majority of people who use this in place of rice or in baking, I purchased it to make popcorn and it's yummy.  Make sure you do NOT use a non stick pan.  Make sure it is very HOT before placing 1 TBS of Amaranth in the pan.  If it doesn't pop immediately your pan isn't hot enough.  Immediately remove your pan from the stove and shake shake shake so it doesn't burn.  Very tasty treat.  Keep in mind alot of the seeds won't pop but they are still very tasty.	11
This one is a common sauce that most people are acquainted with. For the price is a nice addition to the kitchen, for it can raise the level heat from 0 to 60 in seconds flat. The more I cook, the larger the quantity of sauces that I need to transform conventional dishes into more interesting renditions. This one must be used sparingly for those who shy away from hot sauces, but for the crowd that likes it hot it will surely deliver a punch. Been around for a long time, and deserves a 4 Stars for longevity and performance.	11
Kellogg agreed to remove &#8220;all natural&#8221; labeling from its line of Kashi and Bear Naked products, which the lawsuit claimed contain several artificial ingredients. In addition, they're setting aside $5 million in a fund to dole out 50-cent refunds to Kashi customers and $325,000 for Bear Naked customers. They do not seem to disclose all ingredients and after further research, apparently Kashi is owned by Kellogg and donated some $790,700 dollars to defeat prop 37, GM labelling in CA. The question is why wouldn't they want me to know the exact ingredients, after all I am paying for the product.	11
There are a great many products which are vastly superior to ye olde Tobasco, but I still make use of it for a couple of reasons. First, it's cheaper than most of the other stuff out there and you can get a huge bottle of it for a cheap price (like you can here). Second, it has a nice kick to it heat-wise so what it lacks in flavor is compensated by its punch. I use it for in chili, soup, beans, dips, and with other recipes where taste is secondary to bite. This classic still has a lot to offer.	11
I have purchased this product several times and it's consistently a good product. However, all three bags will not close once opened. The bag has a narrow press together zipper and it's a horrible design. Once the fine meal gets into the groove, forget about closing it again, even with an effort to clean it out. I only hope Honeyville reads these reviews because i'd like to see them go for a different bag that has the movable zipper type of closure. I always have to fold the top and put on a couple of rubber bands to keep it secure.	11
I purchased this brand due to recommendations from others in the paleo community.  I should be making bone broths for my source but just can't stomach the smell of it cooking at this time.  I am currently pregnant and want to make sure my body has plenty of the building blocks for healthy skin as my stomach grows.  I am also trying to heal my gut.  If I make soups I add some in and then any hot drinks get some added too.  I have been very pleased with this product so far and will order more when the time comes.	11
"I do not like this for its intended purpose as a hot chocolate drink. To my taste buds, this does not taste rich and chocolate-y despite its name of ""Double Chocolate Meltdown"".But - I add it every day to my morning coffee and for that purpose, it is the best hot chocolate powder around. I've tried many different brands and chocolate flavors but nothing comes close to putting this one in my coffee. It creates the perfect balance between hot chocolate and coffee, and I even make sure to take it with me when going on vacation. Love it for that!"	11
Prompt arrival of product. I used some mixed with water to make a liquid to marinate my strips of meat. The spice is mixed directly into hamburger meat as you make that kind of jerky. I had some left over after marinating so I stuck it in the freezer so as not to just waste what was left, and i think it will be fine to thaw and add to for my next batch. ( I liked the hand striped solid meat better than the hamburger meat jerky). Good stuff if you aren`t into making your own spices for jerky like me.	11
"This came to me packaged very well in protective bubble wrap and I was thrilled to get it.  I am crazy about ham & beans and have been making it in my crock pot for years. I just used this Ham Base for the first time and will never be without it again.  What a delicious difference it has made in my beans!!!  I am eager to make split pea soup now.  It's nice to know that putting a ham bone and meat in it isn't a ""must"" because of how good Better Than Boullion tastes.  Authentic ham flavor. Love this product."	11
"Though it might not appear so, these ""Extrasoft EB17"" brush heads are functionally the same as the ""children's"" heads sold with various cartoon characters on the package. If you find them listed for about $5 per brush head, that's a good bargain (I've seen 1-2 sold for $18).Note that the standard adult Flexisoft EB17 has dual colors, while the Extrasoft heads are all blue. Ensure that the description states ""extra-soft"" and the illustration is the all-blue bristle head."	12
I bought this for my husband, and his first statement was that he didn't know why anyone would say it hurts.  Now, I haven't used it myself (and probably won't since it's been in his nose...), but he did say as long as you're not jamming it up your nose, he can't see how it would hurt.With that said, this product did its job and did it well.  He's pleased, and with that, I'd say it's a recommended item.	12
I just LOVE this brush.  Not only does it &#34;feel good&#34; to the hand, but it's design allows you to easily get into the rounded corners of the bathtub whereas a flat, rectangular shaped brush made rounded areas difficult to clean.  The non-slip rubber grip is a plus as well.  I'm really happy with this purchase.  Will buy again when I need a replacement.  Have been using it for over 10 months and it shows no signs of wear.  Very satisfied.	12
Now that Amazon has lowered the price to less than $4 each, this is a very good deal.  Better than you can get at Target, Walmart, etc.I think these refills make the Braun Syncro shaving system the best out there.  Nothing like a fresh, lemony, sanitary shave every morning.  I have noticed an improvement in my complexion since going to this system.So far my refills have been lasting 5-6 weeks each, which helps to increase the value and lower the cost.	12
I cut myself rather nastily at a friend's house and he gave me one of these.  They seal tightly and absorb blood and fluids to allow natural healing.  You just put the bandage on and leave it; no changing dressings.  Although they're expensive on a per-each basis, because you don't change dressings, they may be less expensive than fabric or plastic bandages per injury.  I bought some for car, home, and suitcase, so I'll have one wherever I might need it.	12
I love ice cream & other dairy products but unfortunately, these pills are the only way I can enjoy them.I've also been recently diagnosed w/ extreme iron overload (I guess having steak everyday for lunch & dinner wasn't a good thing :)), So, now I try to drink milk w/ every meal (esp. if meat is involved). At home, it's no problem since I have access to Lactose-free milk, but at restaurants, you don't have that option so Lactaid pills to the rescue!	12
"I've had severe dry eye for 6+years now. I've used preservative-free thera tears this whole time. They started out with a sturdy little vial that had a resealable tip. Now they've extended the tip with a long ""neck"". When I open the vial it is sometimes still sealed shut. Other times it just squirts everywhere. It's such a waste. Many people are complaining but Advance Research isn't doing a thing about it. I guess we need to log more complaints. E-mail address: info@theratears.com"	12
"I take a lot of supplements.  In fact, I am personally responsible for the ""vitamin and supplement industry bailout program"" (Mr. President, you can thank me later).  Anyway, I have never found a pill container that would hold all my supplements.  I have the size smaller than this one and I would try cramming everything in there and praying the lid would close (and stay closed).  The 3XL size is PERFECT!  My only regret is that I didn't buy 3 or 4 more."	12
Nostalgia has driven me to purchase quite a few of the Clubman products. Aside from the pinaud talc, nothing brings back memories of spending afternoons in the barbershop with my grandfather like this aftershave.It's fresh, clean, and subtle enough to use for any occasion. As far as scent...think Brut with baby powder. This is an alcohol based aftershave, so if it's a moisturizing A/S that you're looking for, this probably isn't it. However, I've never had a problem with it drying me out.	12
This is an excellent product but please use it with 'Caution'.  It worked for me to remove pimple/acne and get rid of the smell after the exercise... read the warnings on the label... Accident may happen so the safest way is completely avoiding the head and facial wash...If it gets into the mid-ear, it can cause deafness and blindness if it gets inside the eye. Just be careful do not let it get inside of your body. This stuff destroys membranes and kills cells.	12
I received this last week.  I bought it to clean jars and glasses.  Does not feel flimsy, does a good job.  The last two bottle cleaners I bought in the grocery store were of appalling quality.  This is in a whole different class.. it works!  I expect to feel the same way next month.June 2012:  This little miracle lasted for more than a YEAR.  I finally retired the first one two months ago and am now using the second one.  Talk about value for money spent!	12
Finally, a solution to damp pits!  I previously had horrendous sweating, and had to change anti-perspirants almost weekly.  Nothing had ever worked.  Now, I can put this on once a week, and use my regular stuff daily.  It actually works, and I haven't had a single instance of wet pits since I started using it.  I'm blown away that it took me so long to find this!It does sting a bit at night when you apply it, but it is absolutely worth it for the results.	12
We got a new point and shoot camera, and it was chewing up regular brand name AA's like they were going out of style.  Discovered these at the local big box store and decided to give them a try.  Wow.  In the name of full disclosure, they cost more than a standard pack of batteries might.  But let's face it, you don't want the camera conking out prematurely at the championship soccer game or that once in a lifetime vacation.  I simply can't recommend these Lithium Energizers enough.	12
First, the instructions to use your first morning urine are bad--it's best to test in the evening. If your cycles vary, there aren't enough tests to ensure you catch your surge. I never got a positive on these, and after testing with Wondfo strips (that provide more tests), I came to realize I ovulate later in my cycle. I never would have realized this on these strips, and I probably would have stuck to my initial fear (that I wasn't ovulating) if I had stayed with this brand.	12
It's going to take me quite a while to use all 150 Band-Aids in the 3-pack, but I'll be ordering more as soon as I'm running low!At only a few cents per Band-Aid, I feel totally alright putting them on EVERYTHING.  Depending on your skin tone, these things can be practically invisible after you apply them.  They have decent sticking power (though not as strong as theBand-Aid Brand Adhesive Bandages, Flexible Fabric, 30 Count (Pack of 2)) and they're perfect for the most common sorts of minor injuries.	12
I had to have a rectal fistulotomy and hemorrhoidectomy. I am a plus sized woman (wear sz 26-28)  and was so worried about finding a sitz bath that would &#34;hold up&#34; through my recovery.  This was a blessing!  The pan is STRONG and I used it daily x4 weeks without any cracking or problems.  We have an elongated toilet bowl, the lid did not fit over the pan, but it was no big deal.  The pan is comfortable to sit on directly.  I am thrilled with the purchase.	12
While I have to agree that the product description lacks clarity, I took a gamble based on the picture and was happy to receive heads that fit my system. Yes, it is still going strong after four years: it replaced a system I bought from the dentist office that crapped out after a year. The replacement heads are widely available, if you don't mind paying $23 for a pack of four - WHICH I DO MIND VERY MUCH. These were $10 for four and I'm a happy camper.	12
Great bottle brush for our household with three kids who all play sports.  So we are constantly washing water bottles that come home from games and practices.  This brush is perfect for cleaning these bottles.  (And I imagine it would work just as well for baby bottles.)  My only complaint is that the bristles compress or collapse over time, so I find I have to replace this brush about every 3 or 4 months.  I always buy the same one again, but I wish it lasted a bit longer!	12
Every year my Lab (Maggie) gets some kind of contact dermatitis or allergy on her Neck. Not sure from what. This year I purchased the BFI and the Columbia Powder. I do remember as a kid I think my parents used the BFI. At that time it was in a little metal can. Anyway  I use them both and they worked great. Just can't say which one works best. They probably both work the same but I would lean towards the BFI because I remember it as a kid.	12
I've been using St. Ives Apricot Scrub since it was introduced back in the mid-1970's and it's a fantastic product!!  I always get the 'Blemish Control' version, not because I have acne anymore (I'm nearly 60), but because the coarseness of the scrub removes all the dead skin and leaves my face glowing with fresh, smooth skin.  People who meet me for the first time can't believe I'm even over 40.  Ok, that's part genetics, but I also give credit to this wonderful face scrub and my Jergens lotion.	12
This bottle brush is great. We bought it for washing things like water bottles and glasses. It might be hard to see in the picture but the blue part of the brush sticks out a little and it more flat to help get all the corners of whatever you're cleaning. Also the grippy part is easy to hold on to and the neck of the brush is long enough for everything I've used it on. I'm always happy with OXO products and this one is no exception.I highly recommend this.	12
I have chronic sinus problems, and allergies, especially to cats.  This product works within MINUTES, even when my sinuses are swollen nearly shut!  It's not very well known, which is a shame, because it's the only thing that makes my life livable around cats.  I buy extra whenever I see them, because they're hard to find locally, and I always want to have one or two around because I HATE not having it when I need it.I highly recommend this product, it is THE best decongestant ever, and works instantly!	12
he apricot scrub is great for removing regular makeup with its gentle but tough formula. I just tried out the apricot scrub and not only does it smell wonderful, it leaves skin soft and touchable.  You can really feel it going to work and exfoliating as  soon as you rub it in. It not only removes makeup but dry skin. Whenever I use St Ives I see a remarkable decrease in whiteheads and blackheads. This scrub is perfect for both adults and teens. Most importantly, its made from natural ingredients.	12
This has nice, large, daily container pockets to easily hold a lot of pills or several big pills for each day. The lids on each day's pockets snap on very tight and don't have a big lip for pulling up to open. I find the lids a little hard to pop free, so it's a balance between knowing the lids will stay closed and easily opening them. It meets my needs very nicely, but I'm not sure I'd recommend this for someone with arthritic hands or not much hand strength.	12
This is my 3rd hitachi. They last a really long time IF you don't use any of the stupid attachments. Taking the attachments on and off will weaken the foam pad and eventually it will be bent and unable to stay focused in the right place.I do not recommend using any attachments. Just use it as is and it will last forever!I also suggest investing in a longer power cord ;)Best vibrator everthe only one you'll ever need(with the exception of a rabbit vibrator, which I also cannot live without)	12
My Casabella bottle brush broke.  The bristles started to falloff then the bristle head snapped off the handle as i was cleaning a bottle.  These were uber cheap $5 as an add-on and I like OXO stuff so I gave it a try.  The bristles are soft (which is what i wanted).  The length is perfect for my needs.Check the dimensions to see if it is long enough for you if you have tall bottles to clean.Shipped quickly and works as described and best of all was the price on amazon!	12
I was very disappointed that the local grocery store and CVS both stopped carrying this tape at the same time. Are they discontinuing it? It was always more expensive than the other brands (store brand, NextCare), but you got what you paid for. I bought 3 rolls to hopefully last me a while.Unlike competing brands, the Johnson and Johnson cloth tape is:1. Easy to cut2. Easy to write on with sharpie, will not bleed and will not fade3. Very sticky4. Does not leave adhesive residue after being pulled off5. Relatively waterproof	12
Consumer Reports tested all the toothpastes that promised to whiten teeth.  Some of these brands were very expensive.  If you should review these test results, you would find that there is no positive correlation between price and actual effectiveness.Ultrabrite was the least expensive and did the best overall job of whitening teeth.  Who would of thought?  The trick is finding Ultrabrite.  I usually have to order it in large quantities on the Internet.  My local grocery store and pharmacy don't sell it.  I guess there isn't enough markup in the price!	12
Homeopathic is just a fancy way of saying placebo. Its all about what you believe. I did extensive research after I bought these because it was not working for me. It might have worked, but a placebo is broken once you arent convinced it isnt doing what it says. If you want something to believe in to make you think your skin is clearing up, then this is perfect for you. However if you are looking for something that is going to ACTUALLY do something, you need to find another product.	12
I would buy it again. I like the masculine smell a lot and it is like a cologne/parfume, it stays with you for a long time and you can sense it all the time. It is really very pleasurable!$5 is a grat price for this. You get a plastic bottle, but who cares (surely a glass one would be more stylish)! I have to point out that this is a odor for mature men, like 25 and older. Do not hesitate on buying it, because it is cheap and smells great.	12
The blades that came with my razor finally gave out...it felt like they were pulling my whiskers out instead of cutting them off. When I put these replacements in, I was amazed at just how bad I'd let those old blades get. My razor again gives me a close, smooth shave without any discomfort.The original blades lasted over two years, but I'll probably not wait that long to replace these. There's really no reason for putting up with any discomfort due to old blades (like I did with the previous set).	12
I got these batteries specifically for my wife's digital camera and have been pleased with their performance to this point. When I first tested them on my battery tester they pegged the needle with their power; I've never seen another battery do that.They've been in my wife's camera now for several weeks and I test them again before we take it out for use and each time they've showed a full charge which has surprised me. If anything develops noteworthey I'll update my review but so far they have exceeded my expectations.	12
This is a great brush.  I use it for my 32oz Nalgene bottles and it works fine, but I also use it for my 16oz Takeya Glass Bottles and it especially works AWESOME for those because it touches all the sides of the bottle when it's in it!  When it's in the Nalgene bottle you have to circle it around to get all the sides, but not so with the smaller diamater bottles.  Handle is the perfect length and the bristles still stick out and look fine after 6 months of use.	12
The single-use container version (no preservative) of Thera Tears is the only one that gives my dry eyes relief, and I've been using this product for years.  I've tried other products, which irritate my eyes rather than soothe them.  More important to me than the applicator design is the availability and pricing of the single-use container version.  Unfortunately, Walmart and Target (whose pricing was great at only $8.58 per box) recently stopped selling the boxes of single-use containers in their stores.  So, now I'm researching new sources for best pricing and availability.	12
This is a stable and excellent product. The quality of the blades are very good, subsequently it serviced my needs MORE than the other ones I had. There were no RUSTING whatsoever and the quality of shave was very COMPACT with low irritation. A very good product to buy, those looking for a reasonably priced fitting blades. At Amazon - the price is excellent for this product. Just update - I left quite a few of these on med. cabinet (which is slightly damp) and returned after 3 months back. NO RUSTS.	12
Bought for my face but have ended up using it for massage/after bath/body oil.  It is NOT 100% vitamin e but an oil blend, though a very nice blend with a nutty smell.  Warning: my cat goes nuts for this so I don't dare leave it open (learned once - he knocked and spilled it) and have to keep it out of their reach.  Not sure if all cats are like mine ;-)  But for humans it's a nice and soft oil, great for sensitive skin and will leave your body glowing.	12
My wife very much enjoys using these cartidges for all her shaving needs. She uses them in the shower regularly, and they last her a long time (at least three weeks usually). She has the power razor, but we opted for the cheaper non-power cartridges, which work just fine. There is still plenty of lubricant on them to provide a smooth shave. Definitely not cheap, but worth paying the extra money for a smooth shave and no nicks and cuts. Amazon pricing is WAAAY better than in most (if not all) stores.	12
I'm trying to give myself my own pedicures as I prepare for my upcoming wedding. I do know that my heels tend to peel periodically, so I bought something that would hopefully not only soften the feet as a whole, but keep them from peeling from now on. This thing does the trick.It smells absolutely lovely. It's a nice, light scent to me (though my fiance claims it's strong - but even he thinks it's very pleasant). It also has the added bonus of keeping the palms of my hands soft, too.	12
my teeth hurt so bad after i used this stuff.  i couldn't even finish using the whole thing, the searing tooth pain was awful!!!!  it was horrible pain i never want to feel again. and my teeth were only a tiny  bit whiter, if anything.  actually they might not have been whiter at all, i think i imagined it. might work for some people w/out a problem but if you have sensitive teeth, cavities or gum disease expect some PAIN. the peroxide really gets in there & chews up the nerves. ouch!	12
This is a poorly designed product.  Once the strips are in your mouth, not only can you not eat, drink, or speak--you cannot even move your tongue!  If it bumps the strip, the strip crinkles, and soon you only have a balled-up piece of plastic stuck to one tooth.  I used over half the box, and only one time did they stay secured the full half hour they are supposed.  Were my teeth whiter?  No.  They just caught the sun better with those little bits of clear plastic stuck in between them.	12
This razor has been pretty crappy to me.  I got it as a Christmas gift about 1 1/2 years ago.  After about 1 year, the foil got a tear in it, so I paid $26 and got the replacement pack (turns out Braun doesn't sell just the foil anymore).  About 6 months after I bought the replcement, the foil got another tear in it.  Now it nicks me every time I use it.  It does a nice job, but it is crap for $30, spend a little extra and get a better razor.	12
I find that cleaning the Braun shaver in the cleaning base with this solution just a couple of times a week is enough.  If you snap the cap back on the cartridge between uses, you can slow down the evaporation and make the cartridge last at least two months.  The bright blue solution will slowly turn gray from the accumulated whisker debris.  When it gets ugly enough, and when the level of liquid starts to get low from evaporation during use, you'll use your own judgement about when to start a new one.	12
Recently started wet shaving and wanted something classic to follow the shaving process with. I'm 44 and this reminds me of the barber shop I got my haircuts back in the early 70's. Definitely a tried and true scent. The alcohol works well with my face after the shave. Have also gotten my 70 year old father back on the double edge and sent this to him. This, combined with the '66 super speed I gave him, brings back many memories for him. Classic with a little sting, great end to a shave.	12
These make excellent play-doh for your little neices and nephews but as earplugs I found them bitterly disappointing. As bitterly disappointing as an earplug can be, that is. Yes, they are soft and can conform to the interior of your ear, but all they do is muffle sound; in no way did they drown out the annoying cacophony of my neighbor who likes to start his parties at one in the morning. Perhaps they are better for higher-pitched sounds that don't have much bass in them, but they didn't save me any sleep.	12
I recently purchase an Oral-B toothbrush. I have been a long-time Sonicare user.I decided to also try these sensitive head brushes besides what came with the toothbrush.  While the other ones do a fine job, I prefer these heads.  They are smaller and seem to me to do a great job.The one thing I miss from my Sonicare brushes is the head cover.  It would be nice to have something that could pop on the brush head especially when traveling.Other than that they are easy to get on and off and rinse easily.	12
I have big skin grafts, and I stopped using it after 6 months, then began again a year later.  And I saw almost immediate results when I began again.  Even my boyfriend noticed.  I have also been using it on a  section of tattoo that I just got which scarred on a few lines.  In a few months the raised skin came down and it doesn't bother me anymore.  The stuff definitely works.  Too bad its so expensive in stores.  The gel is tough to get out of tube when it gets 1/2 full.	12
I bought these for a friend who had surgery and couldn't bathe. I also bought some for myself as I wanted to try them for quick clean ups when I don't have time for a shower. I do shower daily but wanted to try these after taking a walk, or cleaning the house and then need to make a trip to the store. The towels are thick and soft, the scent is kind of odd though, not really fresh or clean smelling. They work okay but are not the best ones on the market.	12
In a world of advertisements that act like a body spray will get a socially challenged male to be ravaged by supermodels, this fragrance is very refreshing. Like so many reviews will say, the fragrance is &#34;old school&#34; and reminds you of a barbershop. I'm sure the fragrance isn't for everyone, but I do enjoy the time tested classiness of the stuff. I am in my early thirties and married so I don't worry about the body sprays too much. Just give me this old school, subtle fragrance to get me through the day.	12
It is surprisingly hard to find a brush like this. I just wanted it to be able to clean my travel mugs really well. I don't like putting them in the dishwasher and a sponge does not reach everywhere. This is a great brush for a good price. I have been using it for about a year and it still looks great, the bristles do not wear easily so I think it will last for a long time. I am now able to reach all those touch spots in my travel mugs, carafes, and vases.	12
This is astoundingly dishwasher tolerant. It has emerged unscathed from the top rack of my dishwasher after pots and pans wash, 6 or 7 times already.Initially, I bought this to clean my tall ello glass water bottle with a narrow opening.  Now I use it on all hand wash serving and glassware.  The bristles are effectively scrub-y, are high quality soft nylon that doesn't scratch glass and collapses to fit into narrow mouth jars and bottles.  The handle is hand injury friendly with typical soft OXO comfort with appropriate density for a secure grip. A+	12
I have had very little problem with this unit. Now & then, when trying to get the lather to come out slowly, you will get a little bit of very hot water in your hand right when the lather first starts to come out. It's not comfortable, but doesn't really burn. The lather, itself, comes out nice and warm and feels very good on the face. Whether it actually helps your shave or not, I have no idea; I haven't really noticed a difference. The great benefit is the nice warm lather on your face.	12
We never seem to have Bandaids around when we needed them so I ordered these. They arrived quickly and contain lots and lots of Bandaids. They are of the no frills variety, meaning your traditional old-school Bandaid. No flexible fiber bands or anything. There are tons of bandaids in here. All sizes and shapes. Great if you have kids who often get hurt, or if you are accident prone. You'll always have a Bandaid in the house with this pack.Pros: Cheap,Lots and lots of Bandaids, all sizes and shapes.Cons: Very basic band-aids, not very sticky.	12
What can I say? Metemucil works, not only to prevent constipation but also to prevent the runs. Our GI doc actually prescribed it years ago to slow down the works.If you check the labels, Metamucil has more soluble fiber that any other supplement I could find. Cheaper too.Since we use one cannister almost monthly the subscribe & save is great. If you drink it in about 10 oz. water quickly, it does not get mushy. Just don't let it sit for any length of time.It is GF, has no MSG or related products or aspartates.	12
"Thanks to an accident at the river I ended up with a large scar at my wrist. I have scars over most of my body so it didnt bother me. What did bother me is going to hand cashiers money and them looking down at my wrist and looking back up at me with that ""oh my he tried to"" looks. The mederma has smoothed the surface and reduced the red shade by 2/3 after 4 weeks. I'm going to continue using the product for another 4 weeks and see how much better it gets."	12
Being constantly anemic, I always dread having to take Iron pills because they leave my stomach so upset.  The Slow Fe tablets are pricey but they are worth it!  No stomach problems associated with iron at all!  My big complaint is that they are extremely hard to open.  It is so time consuming and difficult.  If you have arthritis, opening these will be a nightmare.  I still think the benefits outweigh the cons.  When I am bored, I stand and open 10 or so tablets at a time and put them in a pill box.	12
Wow!! Great price for this pack of six 3.25 sticks of deodorant. Mennen surprised me with this musk deodorant & the quality of it.This deodorant is long lasting & works very well in all situations. This goes on clear & leaves no type of stain on any type of shirt. One stick is long lasting even after applying it several times a day.This is a great way to stock up at an affordable price. I am very,very particular about what I buy & use but could not find anything negative to say about this item.	12
i can't say this stuff work wonders,but I can't say that it doesn't help, Consistency is the key to all work outs and lower calorie intake, There those who truly believe in this product So don't take my review to heart, It could work for you better then other people everyone is different and since we all have different metabolism and health system it will work wonders for some and for some it won't, this is a case of try for yourself and see if it works for you.  Since individual result may (will) vary.	12
These do cushion your feet, but are very HEAVY.  They made my running shoes noticably more heavy.  I went to a local running store and purchased running-specific inserts.  These running-specific inserts allow me to run marathons much more comfortably.  I believe the weight of the Dr Scholls would slow down my running time and add to muscle fatigue.  You get what you pay for -- the running-specific inserts were $24.I now use the Dr Scholls at my job where I work long shifts (often standing).  The Dr Scholls do help eliminate fatigue on the job.	12
I tend to rate products on if they do what they say they will do. This product says it will remove hair from your chest, back and arms and it did. However I did experience bumps in some areas but they cleared up within a couple of hours. I found for best results to leave the product on for about 10 minutes before removing. Especially with thick hair. The only draw back was withing a couple of days I noticed hair starting to come back. But the product did what it said it would do.	12
When it worked, this compact trimmer did a good job.  Unfortunately the motor died after a few months.  The trimmer first developed problems with starting, where it would take a few taps on the housing to get the motor going.  Performance deteriorated until it finally refused to start at all.  The motor reminds me of the cheap DC motors used in model planes, that fail after minimal use.  Maybe I got a lemon, but this trimmer was a total disappointment.  It is cheap, so if it does die, at least you won't lose too much.	12
I bought this item for my husband to read small print as his eyesight was not good.  I borrowed it so many times, that I decided to get one for myself.  Both are used greatly on fine print on our prescription bottles any many other things where they insist on using small print on ingredients, etc. I design and sew  fashions and use it in my design studio every time I have to rip and resew a seam.  I always check with  Amazon when looking for an item.  The PRIME shipping saves a lot of money.	12
I didn't order these because so many things seemed fishy about their presentation on Amazon. The Duracell photos were all different--none of them D batteries in a package of eight. On the product description page, it looked like AA batteries were shown in the image. When I read reviews, many buyers received their batteries unpackaged, just thrown in a box. Others received them in individual bags. A few years ago, I discovered that rip-off batteries are commonly sold on the internet--not the brands they say they are, but fakes.SOOO...no thanks. I'll go with Ray-O-Vac this time.	12
I've used the Mach 3, in its different incarnations, for the past 10 years or so.  But I've always hated buying refill cartridges because of the price.  I even resorted to using disposable Mach 3s for the past few months, but I really hated them.  I was very happy to find these refill cartridges available on Amazon for such a good price, especially with Subscribe and Save.  Now I get them delivered to me at a great price.  Now if I could only find the Mach 3 Turbo or M3Power refill cartridges for the same price...	12
After trying for years to get pregnant (using disposable Fertility tabs, timing methods, thermometers, etc.) we decided to see a fertility doctor. After failing at two IUI's and an IVF, we bought this monitor while waiting to do another IVF cycle.  After the third month, my wife became pregnant! This product is easy to use and apparently more accurate than the disposable types. It is also cheaper than IUI's and IVF. Although this monitor may not help every couple get pregnant, I highly recommend trying this product for a few months before seeking more expensive treatments.	12
I had MRSA a few years ago and was instructed by my doctor to use this everytime I shower.  I use it in a pump and use it in the crevices of the body.  I'm free of the MRSA for years after a few reoccurences and using this product.  May none of you have to deal with that.  Buy this product if it is recommended to you by your doctor or if you have people in your family that get cuts and bruises.  I would use it on any open wound any day of the week.	12
My grandmother has Macular Degeneration.  Her ophthalmologist recommended that she take these vitamins (this formula only). One important note:  the 'servings size' is two per day; So a bottle of 60 will only last one month.  One great thing is that you can have amazon ship this to you automatically every month!  It is perfect for someone who has a difficult time getting to the store, and the price is good (cheaper than at a drug store).  I started taking one per day in hopes to prevent the same illness that my grandmother is suffering from.	12
There is nothing like the smell and feel of a newly cleaned electric razor.  I know they say to clean it when the yellow light comes on but this happens every 3 days.  I do not like leaving the whole unit out so I take the cleaning base out every Sunday, once a week.the solution does a very good job of cleaning it and it smells fresh on the next shave.  I only use it once a week and the solution lasts longer, it does not evaporate.  I estimate this 4 pack will last about one year.	12
I haven't even received this yet, but I've used it years ago for warding off sinus infections and colds. It washes out germs from your sinuses and is very soothing if you already have a problem that started. Helps heal the sinuses. I also use 8 oz. heated filtered water with a quarter teaspoon sea salt dissolved in water and pour it down my sinuses over the sink which works, too. But this in a bottle is more convenient and an excellent price and a huge quantity so you don't have to buy for a long time.	12
I love these inhalers. I stumbled across it at either CVS or RiteAid once and I can't imagine being without it. I've actually been searching for them at drugstores but cant find them again, I'm SO happy Amazon carries it. Amazon Rocks!!If you have a stuffy nose from allergies or a cold, this seriously clears you up right away and keep you clear for hours.  Inhale and soon you'll no longer have a stuffy nose. It works great to prevent snoring too.Vic's inhaler only works for a short period of time. This one works really really well!	12
"I have severe lactose intolerance (not an allergy, ""just"" intolerant) and I usually use the ""Ultra"" form of this product. However, since I used to be okay with the ""Original"" strength Lactaid, I thought this might be more economical, even if I had to take multiple tablets. I was wrong. For some reason, these tablets just didn't work for me, even when I took 3 or 4 tablets for something that would be managed by a single ""Ultra"" tablet.So, if you are really sensitive to dairy products, then you're better off with ""Ultra"" Lactaid, rather than ""Original"" Lactaid."	12
This product is good and I like it, however the price keeps going up just like many other things once they notice it is selling and get greedy. I am seeking a generic brand of this product so that I can lower my out of pocket expenses. I am a man and do use this product, it really does help when you are exposed to bacteria in your system. I will seek an alternative if price does not lower back to the acceptable range it was at previously or seek another store that sells at the lower price.	12
For some time now, I have had one nostril that seems to get clogged up when I go to bed.  I tried using a decongestant (i.e. Sudafed), and that would usually work.  However, I felt like I was taking too much of it because sometimes I would have to take it nearly every night.  I wanted a non-medicine remedy and so I tried these strips.  I'm very happy I did.  I don't know how they work exactly, but they work.  And I've never had a problem with them coming off at night.  They seem to stick just right.	12
I cannot give this product a great rating, because it was not what I needed for my dry eyes. It is kind of thick, but your visions clears fast after blinking a few times and it melts in your eyes. It is very lubricant like ans makes the eyes moist for a long time. My problem is, my dry eyes are caused by allergies, so they not only get very dry but they get very red and itchy. This product does nothing for red, and itchy dry eyes, but it probably very good for normal non-allergy dry eyes.	12
Why anyone would subject themselves to consuming this horrid concoction unless they are close to death is beyond me.  This is the most foul tasting power bar I have ever had the misfortune to consume.  It's rather gooey in texture and bitterly sweet with an overpowering, intense, awful fruit flavoring.  It's loaded with sugar and calories, which is what a power bar typically consists of, but I've had others that at least didn't leave your taste buds damaged for the rest of the day.  Unless you are absolutely desperate for some carbs, avoid this one at all cost.	12
I got two of these - one for my mom and one for my mother-in-law, both in their 80s.  What I wonder is why i didn't get one for me?  I will be wanting to order another for myself.  These were a big hit for these ladies and so useful.  As we age, we need more light to see what was once easy for us to read.  Often we are in areas where the lighting is poor or minimal.  This answers that need.  If you are looking for a product like this, try it.  It will meet your needs.	12
I bought FRER pregnancy tests after two years of using the cheaper Wondfu tests on amazon. I loved the wondfu tests and  left excellent feedback but my third batch I got false positives which was, obviously, heartbreaking. I decided to spend more money and buy these tests instead. Well I got my BFP today and confirmed with a digital EPT brand test as well.  I'm 13 DPO and my period was due in 1-2 days. I did test earlier with these pregnancy tests and all tests were negative until today!! I recommend these tests - accurate and quick/clear results.	12
I hate flossing but I do it anyway.  I actually should say, I &#34;hated&#34; flossing.  The time it takes annoys me and it seems like my gums still bled everytime anyway.  Now I floss, use this to stimulate my gums and then brush.  This tool is awesome.  My gums like it.  They aren't bleeding now and I get more out with this thing because it goes around the whole tooth not just in between.  I really like it a lot enough to use it every day. I actually look forward to using it.  My teeth feel really clean now.	12
I hadn't used St. Ives Apricot Scrub in years because I'd moved on to higher priced and - I assumed - better scrubs. Just tried this scrub again and I was very pleasantly surprised! It really has changed: the scrub particles are finer than they used to be and, even though they provide fabulous exfoliation, there is nothing abrasive about this newer version. If you haven't used St. Ives Apricot Scrub in a while, I suggest you give it another try. I'm thrilled with it and have even started using it on my legs in the shower. Love it!	12
I think fragrance is a personal thing: you either like them or you dislike them, there isn't a lot of middle ground. I personally love the classic Clubman fragrance. It reminds me of the barbershop my dad took me to when I was a kid. Reminds me of him, too. For the price, you can afford to give this a try sometime. Even if you dislike it, it's not like tossing it out would cost you a ton of money. But if you've ever had a haircut in a real barbershop, chance are you are already familiar with Clubman.	12
I am a bit disappointed with this brush. It gets the job done but the bristles seem to splay out easily when using any sort of force. I was able to use this regularly for about three months before deciding the brush was well and truly dead and I needed to find another one. I am now looking around for a new one but if I don't find one to my liking I will probably get another one of these because although it is very short-lived, the grip is comfortable and it does work fairly well while it's still good.	12
After using one for 7 years or so the old professional gave out finally.  The NEW one I had to buy at Target (sorry Amazon when your toothbrush is broke asap is more important then price).  I did the full charge last night and let it run down without a brush on and I am charging it back up to full.  Just got done using it again before bed.  This electric toothbrush is better then their last model and more powerful.  I can tell by how clean my teeth are.  Thanks a bunch Oral B for the High Quality Product.	12
I buy these on Amazon because they cost less than they do at any of the large local stores.  I shave every other day and set the razor to clean after every shave and I find these last quite a while, long enought that I can not reall the last time I put one in, it must have been about two months ago, it is showing the low level light now.  Given this usage I think I go through about three packs a year, not bad to have a nice shave when I want and keep the blad running smooth.	12
I already raved somewhere about these.... they are JUST AMAZING and so far can't seem to find anything betterdon't like pills so these are very thin and compared to regular ones are night and day and they don't smell after like Trojans...you get used to how they look...but again, we disagree on the smell. I don't smell them but my other half does.these are the best we've tried so far! just amazing! ....they're hard to open but totally worth the price and the effort. He loves them, definately the best out there that we've tried. They're not slimy....will order again!	12
This is IMHO the best floss you can get with or without braces. It takes some practice, and when you get it, you will see how effective this floss is. The fabric works very well at removing an incredible amount of gunk b/w your teeth. It will shred if you get it caught on your braces or if you snag it on something but again it takes practice to avoid doing that. I havent been able to find this stuff in stores around my home, usually, its the only hanger thats empty. Annoying so I have had to buy online.	12
This product (by Nature's Bounty) claims that there are 1 billion ACTIVE Lactobacilli in the pills. The best established test for ACTIVE Lactobacilli is to give them substrate (warm milk) and let them grow over night. Test Result: Two pills smashed to powder and mixed with warm milk (37'C) did NOT produce any growth (fermentation) overnight!. That means that Nature's Bounty is selling us Cellulose + Fructose flavored with strawberry. Should have done this test earlier. Will never buy from Nature's Bounty again. And will start testing one after another other vendors. Hope there will be a product for real?!	12
This stuff is great. I have read mixed reviews before that say the product is too harsh for your skin, but I love it. I definitely don't use it daily because I think that *would* be too harsh, but I love it for those days when I need a deeper clean and a nice exfoliation. It smells great and it always leaves my skin feeling great. I don't know that I'd recommend it to those with very sensitive skin, but it's also really inexpensive so it may be worth a purchase just to see how your skin reacts to it.	12
No kitchen should be without one of these.  This has replaced my two other dish and bottle scrubbers.  I now use this when washing dishes almost exclusively since it gets down into glasses and cleans the inside of them very easily.  I pop it into the dishwasher when I run it. It is flexible enough to get into anything but still sturdy enough to get the job done fast and easy. Works well on dishes too so it's not just strictly for bottles but for anything in the kitchen.  Nice long handle also. I wish I had found this years ago.	12
"I'm buying this set of 6 shaving creams for my husband for the 2nd time....if he didn't like the cream he would have said not to purchase again. At $2.99 per can it is slightly higher than if I were to wait for it to go on sale at CVS or Rite Aid but because of the convenience of home delivery the extra .10 per can is more than worth it for me. I think it smells good and my husband is happy with how it shaves....so there you have it, not exactly a rave review but definitely a ""thumbs up"".Cheers"	12
I purchased this product because I have decided to be in TOTAL GREAT HEALTH, I did not want to start off with anything that would give me the shakes or have me feeling weird or bad, I wanted something natural to help with my stomach fat, I can say that I have changed my diet, smoothie in the mornings, water all day, and a full course meal with protein and vegetables, no bread and no sugar, walking every day for 30-45 minutes, I have have seen a tremendous result. I feel much better and I am determined to obtain total health.	12
Most oxo products are awesome; this one is no exception.  It cuts very well and looks nice, too.  Very high quality.  Comfortable to use.  I have oxo's good grips nylon pie server for my non-stick and cast-iron pans, but it's nice to have two to choose from depending on the job.  As great as the nylon one is, it's just not as strong and can't cut quite as clear of a line.  So I recommend both.	13
"I've never quite gotten ""the hang"" of electric can openers-- if I get the can open, it's truly LUCK--not SKILL.  Decided to return to a good old-fashioned can opener, but since they can be hard to turn at times, I decided to splurge on this one. It is soooo well worth the extra money.  I just love Oxo's squirting dish brush (the only one I've ever used that doesn't leak!), & I will definitely try more of their products.  Truly impressive."	13
This kitchen tool I use almost every day.  Great for cutting, chopping and scraping, I wonder what I used to use before I got one of these.  Now I give them as gifts, to my kids as they have left the house, and for wedding gifts. (Goes nicely with a brownie pan or cookie sheet.)  I use mine for making scones, cutting brownies, scraping dough, cutting butter, so many different uses.  It's very sturdy and will last my lifetime I'm sure!	13
Having owned this item for ?about a year?, it's already got a few rust spots on it. I put it in the dishwasher. Apparently, it doesn't like that. I like the size, especially for lasagna, or a large piece of cake ;), but it is not the first spatula I reach for any more since it rusted. My other spatula that's the same size has a wooden handle, so it's a pain. Sure wish this item was a bit better quality stainless!	13
I was doubtful about getting two sets of these, but I am glad I did.  They are just right for children.  They don't hold all that much fluid so if there is a spill...and there is ALWAYS a spill...it isn't so bad.  I put them in the dishwasher on the top shelf.  They've been holding up well.  We've had a couple left in weird places that ended up holding science experiments but they washed up just fine. Get them.  They're terrific for families.	13
I don't mean to be a stick in the mud, but why spend this much for 4 of these, when you can buy a huge pack (50 or more) of wooden clothespins for less than $3.00?  I've been using them as chip-clips, cereal bag clips, cookbook page holders, etc. for years. and they never break.  Don't buy the colored plastic ones - wood ones are best. I keep them in a little wire bin in my junk drawer, and never have to hunt.	13
"I've never used a vegetable brush before, but after scrubbing potato skins until my skin started to prune, I figured I'd try it when it was on sale.Wow! I didn't realize how well a simple device like this could work! Scrubs and cleans potato skins perfectly, and about 90 percent faster than scrubbing with your fingers alone.This is just a great little implement, one of those things that makes an annoying chore go so much faster.Highly recommend for ""non brush"" types like myself."	13
This is the best peeler I have used!  I have one and have given them as gifts numerous times. The grip is comfortable, the peeling action is smooth and quick and it just is a joy to use.  What more could you want? My wife  has carpal tunnel and loves the whole line of OXO products, but this one is  our favorite. Even my 11 year old daughter begs me to use it when I peel  vegetables.This is the last peeler you'll ever need!	13
"This bottle/can opener feels just like the OXO Good Grips vegetable peeler.  Its black, rubberized grip has a section of ""gills"" that molds to your grip for better control.  When you're done, just pop it in the dishwasher.  The only drawback is that with long term use, the ""gills"" sometimes break off.  It took years for that to happen to mine (only one section).This is hardly an elegant device, but it works well and is perfect for everyday and outdoor use.-- Debbie Lee Wesselmann"	13
This is without a doubt the one of the best, and I've actually tried a few. I've had mine for four years now and it still WORKS as good as the day I bought it. Never mind comments about it being too bulky(smaller versions are available). If you make a lot of salads, this is a must have. It's sturdy and wrings salad dry within 1-2 spins. Most importantly, no awlful hand cranks that can brake off. For this kind of quality,it's worth every penny.	13
I've used many vegetable brushes, mostly the horseshoe shaped with a handle, purchased from stores such as Sears,pennies, the ...marts, & kitchen stores. I was skeptical of the positive reviews about this one. I haven't had it a week yetbut so far it is clearly the best I've ever used! I've cleaned large carrots, turnips, & parsnips with it. I am impressed how well it fits in my hand & the ease & superior way it cleans. Not only better cleaning but faster. Strongly recommend.	13
If you're preparing shrimp and hate deveining them, this is the tool to get. Not really &quot;veins,&quot; the dark line on the outside of a shrimp is actually its digestive tract - so if you eat it, you're basically eating shrimp excrement. Put that in your cocktail sauce!  Still, this is a delicate little cord that you don't want breaking up into pieces, but just yank out quickly and get on to the next shrimp.  This tool does just that, and ergonomically fits your hand.	13
really like this turner...i purchased my first one 10 years ago +/-, after the years of using it, the rubber on the handle sides started to peel and break off, so i've replaced it.  I'm now thinking I should buy one or two more to last me my life...why ?? because i really like the size and i use it  for all my pancakes, eggs, burgers etc..and i don't want to change to another style.  beware you too might get attached to this simple thing	13
As someone who a) does a lot of baking and b) has had arthritis for the past two decades, Oxo's Good Grips Sifter is a lifesaver for sore hands. Instead of the usual squeeze trigger found on metal sifters, the Oxo sifter swings from side to side, no squeezing required.In addition to the user-friendly design, the Oxo can measure up to two cups of flour, and the included top and bottom storage lids add to its versatility. This is a wonderful gift for any cook.	13
This is one of the best household products I ever bought.  This is a very powerful little unit and makes all those hard to clean areas a snap to clean.  I don't know what I did without this before.  From day one it was in use.  I now can get all the floor corners and ceiling corners that were so hard to get with a regular Vacuum and attachments.  And, you can vacuum your car with this too.  You can't go wrong with this canister vac.	13
This scoop works great. I first tried the pointed ice cream scoop and  couldn't use it. I have problems with my wrists. I have used other Oxo  tools and love them, so I tried again with this scoop. It works so well it  seems to be designed with me in mind. It is easy to dip out even the  hardest ice cream now and the bail pops the ice cream out of the scoop  --clean as a whistle. You can wash it in the dishwasher too.	13
This apple corer/slicer is a awesome for the non-OCD apple cutter. It's sturdy and sharp and gets the job done well. The only issue is that the metal pieces in the middle are glues together such that small chunks of apple get stuck, no matter how much you wash it. Most people would not be bothered by this, but as a microbiologist I find this very disconcerting and wishing it was one solid piece. Aside from this little flaw, it's been a very wonderful little utensil.	13
Well there's not much you can say about a melon baller. It works? I don't use it on melons, I use it to make meatballs and cake balls, and the large scoop is really good for that. I can imagine that there are situations where the little scoop is also useful, but I personally don't use it. The handle is really great because of its texture. When your fingers are slimy (making meatballs, etc. can be a messy business), it's a good grip to hold onto.	13
I use the Oxo Good Grips Nylon Balloon Whisk to Whisk away dirty, corrupt politicians when I visit any public building.  So far, it has proved to be quite ineffective, but I don't think it has to do with its design.  It's quite simple to be sure, but just isn't the right type of design necessary for the job.  The wire version would be more suitable I think.Beat heads, stir flatter, whip scream and stir losses in comfort though, that you can be sure to do.	13
Highly recommended! I LOVE this ice cream maker. It's so easy and the results are amazing. I like GOOD ice cream (like Haagen-Dazs)and this machine creates stellar ice cream. It rivals any of the best ice cream you can find. Even the basic recipes produce excellent ice cream. I've made mint chip, premium vanilla bean and strawberry. I do recommend using quality dairy products for best results (I use Organic Valley milk and heavy cream). Sorry, Haagen-Dazs. I won't be buying any more ice cream from you!	13
This was a good purchase and the recipe book is great! I've made half of them now; some were awesome, some good, some didn't work. The only negative was that it was pretty loud and it got hot around the base after 10 minutes or so, which I found strange. An ice cream maker shouldn't get hot! The ice cream is still really yummy, but the machine could use a few mechanical tweeks. Overall, for $60, it does the job and there haven't been any major problems!	13
I read many of the reviews before buying this ice cream maker, and the reviewers were right!  It's a great little machine...I don't think it's that noisy (no more so than a food processor).  I love it - I do agree that the recipes that come with it are not great, but there are lots of wonderful recipes out there.  This is fast, easy, and no worries about salt and ice running all over make it much more likely I will continue to use it quite often!	13
I bought an ActionPacker box exactly like this one many, many (20?) years ago to serve as a newspaper box on my front steps. It has sat out in broiling sun, freezing winter, pouring rain, and the worst that happened was that the color faded and it started looking a bit grungy. I was delighted to see that these were still available, and the new one looks just like the old one, but with brighter colors (and less dirt!) It should be good for another 20 years!	13
I learned about this brand through the Today's show one morning.  And they were not kidding-- This company does have great products!I uploaded a picture to illustrate how well the corer does the job.  Everything came out nicely and neatly.  All it took was bit of turning and pushing, and then the whole core came out like a beauty!  I just love it!  Plus, it saves so much time.Yes-- the handle/grip is absolutely well designed.  It fits in my hand well and it doesn't slip at all.	13
Although this is described as a pastry scraper, we have found it has many uses. It is an all-purpose scraper/cutter. Oxo is known for ergonomically designed tools, combining form & function.  This is perfectly balanced & weighted  & fits the hand of many people (from kids to big men).A well designed piece of equipment like this makes cooking even more pleasurable & helps to broaden the scope of your culinary talents!This tool is very helpful in the creation of the perfect pizza, breads, doughs, and yes-even meatloaf!	13
"Yup, this is a great peeler.  The handle is sturdy and feels good in the hand.  The ""grips"" help avoid slippage with your wet, kitchen hands.  Swivel action helps when peeling uneven surfaces (think potatoes).  The guard over the top of the blade aids in gripping and safety.The peeler I had before this was some cheap little thing I got at the grocery store.  It's definitely worth a few extra bucks to get a real peeler.  Especially if you love sweet potato mash as much as I do!"	13
Apple corers have always been a pain.  The kind wth the handles that you center over the apple and push down into wedges...those just don't work well.  If the core is off center, you end up with a difficult cut and having to pare away the core from the slices.This Oxo Good Grips Corer is nice.  The trick to using this one is to twist as you push and yo get a much cleaner coring.  I used this and then slice the apples into rings...my kids love it.	13
"We got this knife after receiving a breadmaker as a gift.  A sharp bread knife is a must for cutting fresh bread without reducing it to crumbs, and this knife does just that.  It has the nice ""good Grips"" handle and is a good length.  It is nice and sharp and for the price, I'll probably just replace it if it gets too dull.  It is not the fanciest knife I own, but it does the intended job nicely and at a great price.  Good, basic bread knife!"	13
Just received it, tried it out of course to see if it worked, was disappointed when I couldn't get it to spin until I realized I had to remove the little piece of yellow foam that kept it from working.  Yes, will have a yummy salad tonight, now that I don't have to dry lettuce leaves on paper towels anymore.  i had one before but don't know what happened to it......maybe I gave it away by mistake.  Big mistake.  Hope this will be my last one.  Works great.	13
I have been very pleased with my purchase of the OXO can opener.  This is heavy and very durable.  This can open anything from soup cans, large fruit cans, and large coffee cans easily.  I have read that OXO designs their products so they will be easy to use, and easy on your hands.  I have found this can opener to live up to being easy to use.  If you are looking for a replacement can opener, I think you will find this a good one to choose.	13
I was fixing to do some mixing in my kitchen one day.  I grabbed this bowl, tossed in some ingredients and went to town.  I mixed for days and days without ceasing...why?  Its not becuase I'm a crazed lunatic who likes to do the man dance on the rooftop...no...its because this bowl was magical.  It made me sing while I mixed.  I sang songs of mixing.  Sweet, tender yet robust songs.  I'll make an album of my mixing songs.  Look for me on TV soon.  Mixing and singing.	13
This is a nice window fan with good power and not too noisy, adaptable to different window sizes if you need to move it. However, the sliding panels are flimsy and don't move smoothly; the fasteners that are used to clamp the panels in place are cheap and can easily be unscrewed and fall out.  The single knob control works fine but the settings are hard to see; you will end up turning it by click or fan noise to the desired power or direction. Well-packaged in the box.	13
"We have owned these tongs for a while now and I cannot find anything to complain about!  The handle(s) are very sturdy - allowing you to really get a good squeeze on something if it is heavy or slippery.  The stainless steel always emerges from the dishwasher spotlessly clean and the ""locking"" mechanism allows these to be stored in the folded position, saving me a lot of cluttered drawer headaches!Seriously, these would be good tongs at any price and at this price they are well worth the money spent."	13
My husband and I do lots of cooking and had an OXO salad spinner for years. It finally gave out and we replaced it with a salad spinner from another &#34;trusted brand name&#34;. It broke within a week, the spin was so weak it didn't remove any moisture whatsoever.  I found this brand new and slightly restyled OXO and bought it immediately. The OXO spins lettuce, cabbage, spinach quickly and easily. With the new clear bowl you can see how much water is coming off of the freshly leaves.	13
I bought this mainly to use for a pumpkin pie recipe. The recipe said to strain a mixture of pumpkin and yams through the mesh strainer. I will not lie, it was a pain. But the mesh strainer was durable and easy to grip. I laid it over a bowl, and it stayed steady while I strained the thick pumpkin mixture. I think I pushed it's abilities to the max, but the important thing is, it held up. Great purchase, I bought another one just to have on hand.	13
This has worked out perfectly for making waffles.  I have to make a double recipe, so the size comes in handy.  I was somewhat uneasy at first about the round bottom, but this has been no problem at all; the bowl isn't the least bit unsteady, even when I have the ladle in it for spooning the batter into the waffle maker.  It cleans up in the dishwasher just fine also.  Alternatively, I use this bowl for making jello, and then is when I really appreciate the pour spout.	13
I needed a good bread knife that would easily slice artisan loaves.  After reading the reviews, I purchased this one.  I like the fact that it is sharp, but I wish it was a longer length to handle wider loaves.  And I prefer a knife with more weight to it.  This one is very light weight, so at times the slices are not uniform....one side will be thinner than the other.  It's like the knife is a little hard to control.  However, it cost so little, it was worth trying.	13
My only gripe with this ricer is that some of the potato squishes out over the lid when pressing down on the contents.  I don't think it matters how much or little is in the canister, it's just the way it works.  Other than that, the handles are easy to use and give you great leverage when ricing, even if the potatoes are a little firm.  If you've never used a ricer before, go ahead and get this -- you'll get much fluffier mashed potatoes than by using a masher.	13
These tongs are the perfect length for cooking on the grill. I use a kettle grill which can get especially hot, but I get relief when using these tongs.These are solid build and they do not feel for anything when picking up heavy items. That is one of my pet peeves of previous tongs that I have owned. They flex to the point that the object being grasped falls out. I have not even come close to that point with these.The locking mechanism on the back works great as well.	13
"Thought I was nuts to pay such a price for tongs, but after using them it wasn't nutty at all.  The over-all quality is outstanding, the ""look and feel"" is great, and this item does its job really well.  The locking feature is a great idea.  A pleasure to own and use.A very minor complaint: the movement of the locking tab is rough.Added Dec 25: I have since bought the 8"" and ditto the above; this is really a convenient size.  This one has a nylon locking tab which is smooth."	13
I'm at a loss to understand the negative reviews of this product here on Amazon. I've had one for two or three years now, and I think it's one of the best kitchen tools I ever bought. It's lightweight, small enough to store easily, comfortable, easy to use, and I even like the sound it makes when it's slicing through a can top. And the locking mechanism means I don't have to keep squeezing while I turn the easily-grasped turning knob.This thing is well-designed and well-constructed. I'd recommend it to anyone.	13
My oh My!  This is the thing to have. Works like a charm at spinning out water on lettuce. Getting it dry makes it keep longer in the refrig. Nice product, nice size and quality. Will replace with same product if this one wears out, which will be a long time from now. I like how the push button can be locked in and make it easier to store, making it less tall, and taking up less room in cabinet or refrigerator. Would make a great gift for a new bride.	13
This OXO salad spinner is really wonderful.  It allows me to easily dry lettuce, berries, or any other type of produce.The press pump feature far surpasses spinners that require you to yank or rotate to get traction to spin.  The hard bowl ensures your salad spinners will not change shape while drying over dishes, thus not working until reshaped.  I really think OXO fit the nail on the head with this one.  The pump can even be stored in the down position to serve as a storage vessel for your greens!	13
This OXO mini salad and herb spinner seems to be holding up the one I bought 6 months ago hadit's spring break after 5 uses. Cannot understand what's up with these mini salad spinners...the one I've been trying to replace lasted 20 years and the only reason I gave it away was because as my family is grown and I'm only spinning lettuce for one person at a timeI figured this would take up less room in the kitchen. BIG MISTAKE as the newer one seem to havea very fragile mechanism.	13
This is the best vegetable brush I've ever used!  My old one was really soft and barely got the dirt off of vegetables.  The bristles on this one are just right!  Stiff enough to really clean the veggies (I've never had cleaner baked potatoes!) and soft enough that it doesn't tear the skins, even on the thinner-skinned sweet potatoes!  I just love it and it has a place of honor right above my sink, in easy reach!  The size and grip is perfect, too!  Love it!Oxo Good Grips Flexible Vegetable Brush	13
Bought this and initially loved it despite the fact that occasionally the top would loosen and dishsoap would leak out. Then I felt the bristles were a bit soft for tough scrubbing jobs (baked on brownie/burned casserole/lasagna pan/etc). DON'T make the mistake I did of using on hot pan which then melted the bristles to laying flat instead of vertical. After that the thing was useless... they need to make one with HEATPROOF bristles so you can scrub away while pot is hot. Will probably not replace with the same item.	13
I'm so happy when we dumped our klunky, loud, unsanitary and ineffective countertop can opener! Not all appliances are better than the old fashion manual gadgets. The OXO easily opens cans of all sizes in a flash. No more fighting with an electric opener that can't seem to grip the edge of the can! This opener is so easy, fast & quiet to use and it isn't an eyesore in my kitchen. To keep it clean, we just toss it in the dish washer. After 3 years, I still love it!	13
Nothing to complain on this one. It is a nice spatula. I am using it to cut and lift pizza and it does a great job. Easy to clean. I have two different ones from XOX - wanted to see if there was a difference in quality from the same brand, but a different model. They are exactly the same just a different grip  as you hold them. I do think that it is the kind of spatula that you can have for years with only a little common sense maintenance.	13
No assembly and ready to go out of box.  2 ounce of cleaner and 1/2 gallon hot water to fill the unit through a convenient fill hole.  Unit does not have to be disassembled to empty, a convenient drain spout.After first use, waste water came out black, and an immediate elimination of pet odor in the stairway.Small size and light weight make it idea for immediate spill clean ups.Unit is built top heavy with a large handle, this balances the weight when solution is in the unit.Cord could be longer and retractable.	13
"Yes, it's good at what it does: scraping. As an added bonus, there are measurements on the scraper in case you really need to get precise with the dough you're scraping off the counter. This thing does a great job of cleaning up the countertop after kneading bread and getting flour all over the place. So it really does do more than scraping: you can use it to divide dough, clean gunk off the counter, release sticky dough from a smooth countertop, measuring something that's less than 4"" long, fight ninjas, etc."	13
"I put this ice cream maker on my Amazon.com wish list, and my sweet daughter sent it to me for my birthday. :)I just made my first batch of ice cream today. I'm very pleased with both the machine's performance and the taste/texture of the ice cream. My youngest daughter tasted the ice cream and said it was ""awesome."" I agree.About the noise level: I'm rather sensitive to loud noise, but I don't think this machine is particularly noisy. It's not whisper quiet, but it's not nearly as noisy as my Cuisinart blender."	13
I bought 4 of these units from Home Depot in 2005 while building a new home; I paid 15 bucks each.  I use them to automatically shut-off three bathroom fans and a laundry room fan (Broan-NuTone QTREN080 80 CFM, 0.8 Sones, Energy Star Fan).  The timer instructions and face plate say to turn the nob passed 10 minutes (at least), which I do.  They still work great after 6 years.They were easy to install.  And they shut-off the fans consistently.  No complaints.  I would purchase one of these again, if it ever failed.	13
I bought this item in March of 2011.Almost 2 years later, and with CONSTANT, REGULAR, FREQUENT daily use in our business office kitchen, the bristles have kept their integrity.This is wholly unlike most dish brushes which lose their shape and become annoyingly flat on the side you use the most, thereby rendering the brush USELESS.HIGHLY HIGHLY HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!!!!!!!!!!!!!!The only note for potential buyers is the brush I bought 2 years ago had a completely black handle, not the black/white one shown in the photo, so don't be shocked if you get something different!	13
I've had them all!  Wood, Plastic and Aluminum and I prefer the Aluminum type.Even though the wood works a little bit better, it's harder to clean and after a while it starts to look gunky and unhealthy.  Hard to wash the wood after it's been used a while and the wood is no longer smooth.  No matter how hard you wash, it still feels slimy and that's what bothers me.You may have to work a bit harder with the plastic or aluminum but when you wash them, they're clean and they feel clean.	13
This review is from: OXO Good Grips Flexible Vegetable Brush (Kitchen)This is a good vegetable brush that you can use to scrub dirt off of potatoes and many other vegetables. I can't get excited about it though because I think it would be a lot better if it were a little bigger.The quality of the brush and the deal are pretty good. Sure it fits into the center of a palm, but I think it's marketed to make a weakness sound like strength. I'd like a bigger brush, ideally, with the same quality.	13
This is a very flexible spatula so isn't suited to general use but  when you need one like this it is wonderful. The only reason I don't give it 5stars is that this is my 3rd one. Because it is flexible it pulls on the solder points on the handle if you are moving something a bit heavy so eventually it pulls out at the joints. I have never seen one this thin anywhere else so can't compare it but OXO generally makes good, affordable equipment and I am happy with their quality.	13
If, like me, you learned to mash potatoes with one of those mashers that looks like a thick wire bent back and forth, you probably don't like mashing potatoes by hand. The wire tools don't work very well. This masher does! Spray it with a little non-stick spray, mash a few time, and yum. This is definitely the tool to mash potatoes by hand. I avoided making mashed potatoes before I learned about this type of masher, now I make them frequently. It's small price to pay for a tool that really works.	13
This can opener has been with us for about two years now and I can't say I have any complaints about it. The handles with rubber grips are substantial and sturdy. The can opening device (teeth?) has (have) not bent or given way to any cans. And, the knob has been made of durable plastic, so it hasn't chipped or flaked. We typically don't put this in the dishwasher, and I wouldn't really see the need to--hot soapy water works just fine. Definitely recommend this to anyone looking to replace their can opener.	13
My original vacuum had a hepa filter on it that needing replacing and apparently the manufacturer no longer made them.  I ordered this vacuum because all it needed was a bag.  I am very pleased with it.  It is fairly quiet for a vacuum cleaner, my old model used to scream like a banshee,  and it doesn't have a bunch of hoses wrapped around it constantly coming loose like my old model.  It cleans the carpet just as well as the old model.If you just need to vacuum the floor, this model is great.	13
The belts as such are excellent but the Hoover keeps killing them every few months.  My wife uses it carefully but the belt is so tightly stretched around the pegs it is bound to snap and thats what happens.  There got to be much better design.  I had to buy several belts and keep in stock but now I am really fed up with the above Hoover vacuum about this!  I have an older Hoover which has been working since 1988 without a hitch, really.  They do not make things like that any more!!!!!	13
I rather enjoyed this peeler. In fact, when I first used it, I was disappointed I didn't have more stuff to peel. This peeler does not require any elbow grease to move it down the vegetable and get it to peel--you don't have to apply any pressure. The handle is nice and big so it feels comfortable in your hand. The head swivels a bit so the blade can adjust to the contour of the vegetables quite easily which is necessary when you are peeling things like potatoes. I am glad I bought it.	13
Does exactly what it is made to do and does it well, spins enough salad for 4 people at a time. Easy to clean and efficient. If you are wondering if this is something you would use; if you eat salad greens or want fruit dried quickly you will use it often. I didn't buy one for 2 years wondering if its something that would just sit and never be used now its used often. Feels like an essential item. This was also rated by Americas Test Kitchen 2012 as the best salad spinner.	13
I'm not even sure what prompted me to buy this but I use it all the time so now I'm wondering how I got along without it.  I use it to wash rice and beans or anything else I want to strain the liquid from to make sauces.  Under the heading of too much information my garbage disposal recently died and my sink has always been slow draining so I've been using it to strain out the dredges from soaking pans.  It's disgusting but it helps keep the drain running.  Fairly easy clean up.	13
Love it, love it, love it! I didn't buy it until I read every single review and decided I had to try it. High sides make for easy stirring, no slip bottom is AWESOME as I always did the &quot;bowl chase&quot; when trying to stir batters..rubber handle is a plus for grabbing and holding on, spout great for what I purchased it for: pouring batter for pancakes/waffles and easy clean. My husband refuses to mix in any bowl but that one so I constantly have to wash it out to get a turn! Awesome..	13
I love this because you decide on the ratio of cream to milk & how much sugar/sweeterner to add.  Also, I always store mine in the freezer so it is ready to go whenever anybody wants to make ice cream.  It's so simple that my kids can mix the 4 ingredients in the blender, pour it into the frozen bowl, turn it on, & 25 minutes later, you've got delicious ice cream.  Add extra mix-ins at the end for a variety of flavors.  We love it & there's nothing better on a hot summer night.	13
For years, hubby and I have bought Lasko fans to keep in our bedroom.  This is our third one.We use it to keep the air circulating and for the white noise to help me sleep.None of the three that we've owned have had any whining, squeaking, rattling or weird noises.  Just a nice, smooth hum.It does blow hard.The first one died because I let it get too dusty.  The second one lasted for 7 years and I only replaced it because my son needed a fan and I wanted a shiny new one for myself.	13
Switching from vertical to horizontal took a little getting used to, but I love this peeler. I had a similar one when I first married but lost it in a move or something early on. I'd thought several times I'd get another, because I did like it, but didn't get around to doing that until the old wooden vertical one finally wore out. I really like it. I especially like the little scoop on the side that lets you scoop out potato eyes while you're peeling. Nice feature. Comfortable to grip, like all OXO products.	13
This one was a gift, but I have an identical one (although not green). I use it all the time, and it works wonderfully. It's a bit bulky to store, but I especially love it during the summer when I'm getting lots of fresh greens in my CSA share. I wash them and dry them in this, and then I store them in this in the refrigerator. It works perfectly as a crisper in the fridge, and keeps greens fresh and crisp up to two weeks, which is kind of amazing. I love this thing.	13
Before Hurricane Katrina, I owned both a large and small OXO GOOD GRIPS salad spinner. They are the easiest to use for arthritic hands. Just push down on the top, and it spins it's little heart out. And it has a button to put the brakes on!! I had used several types before these, but these are by far the best. I would recommend these to anyone. I am still trying to replace everything I lost a little at at time(19 months post-Katrina), and will soon be buying 2 brand new, mold-free, OXO salad spinners.	13
This brush is well designed and constructed. I've used it for over a year, so I know for sure that it's pretty durable. And it has an attractive look about it.So I can recommend this, but it's with one reservation. Oxo has a compact version that sells for $7 less. When I decide to get another brush for a second bathroom, that's the model I expect to get. So, a careful consideration of the size that you actually need might allow you to save some money.And in this economy, that's not such a bad idea.	13
I find I reach for it often. The mesh is pretty fine so straining stock/sauce with lots of small bits, it can get clogged -- but it strains everything. Have been using this strainer for four years and it looks new. We run it through the dishwasher.The little hook is nice from hanging it on a bowl. It fits in the corner of my sink to allow a slow drain (like for frozen veggies). Nice. As we think about downsizing, I may find a slightly bigger one to add and then give away big colanders.	13
I bought one of these and a regular red Oxo spatula, and I've found that I really don't need any others. I think I would reccommend the red over the white, just because you don't need to put any thought into which one to grab for the spaghetti sauce. I've left these in a hot pot of alfredo sauce for half an hour (OOps!) and it came out completely unscathed. Also love that nice grippy handle. Buy one regular red and one spoon shaped red Oxo spatula, and you won't need to buy any others!	13
I've gone through two of these and won't purchase another.  The first one broke after using it a three or four times, but since I like Oxo products in general, I assumed it just a fluke. The second one I simply threw away. As other reviewers have pointed out, it uses tiny, metal teeth to grip the lid, which slip and could conceivably cause injury. It was worthless, so I'm back to the old technique of using hot water on the lid and banging the sides with a  spoon.  Works better than Oxo, that's for sure.	13
The slicer is slightly smaller than a large cheese brick so you can't use it unless you slice some off the side first... but when you do use it- it slices a perfect wedge about the right size for a sandwich.Only problem, is, the more slices you need, the harder the plane is to slice through the cheese because it really starts to stick to the cheese, and does so more and more after each slice.I love OXO normally, so, I also got the wire cheese slicer.  It works much better than the cheese plane does.	13
I've tried several stainless tongs and this is the best yet.  My previous favorites had the spring rust out after a year or so of heavy use and many trips through the dishwasher.  I think these will hold up better and they have all the features.  Rubber inserts in the handles for a good grip.  Locking tab in the hinge to keep them folded up for storage.  Just the right shape and serrations on the business end for gripping just about anything you would want to use them for.  I'll be getting more of this brand!	13
This is yet another item I bought based on a recommendation from Cooks Illustrated.  In the interest of full disclosure I have to admit that I've only used it for removing cookies so far but it has performed great.  I'm not into making huge half pound burgers but I can easily imagine this being sturdy enough to handle quarter pound burgers like I prefer and other items that are not excessively heavy.  It was a purchase that I don't have any regrets about making and I recommend it to anybody looking for a good dependable spatula.	13
Fed-Ex just dropped it at my door a matter of minutes ago.  Thought I would give it quick test on the kitchen floor.  WOW!  Floor clean in seconds.  Before I realized it, the entire 2 bedroom apartment was clean in a couple of minutes.  It whizzed across the ceramic tile floors and short nap throw rugs.  Who knew this kind of power could be had for 65 dollars?  Excellent value.  How can such a light weight vacuum have so much power?  It took me longer to write this review then vacuum the entire apartment.  I love it.	13
The good is the handle.  It is very comfortable to hold and to use.  The bad is that it needs to be because the scoop itself has a difficult time navigating through stiff, frozen ice cream.  I compared it head to head with a scoop from Tupperware and it just couldn't compete.  The OXO scoop was much more comfortable in my hand, but it was an effort to achieve results.  I wouldn't say it was any better than average.  The esteem I hold for the Tupperware scoop has increased a notch.Disclosure:  I have no connection to Tupperware	13
I bought this for $3.99 and the shipping on it was free, by itself.  It feels secure in your hand and it has done a good job so far.  I would not recommend that you use it as a replacement for a peeler, but it definitely deserves your consideration to scrub the dirt and chemicals from the outside layer of vegetables.The circular grip is something that will probably be hit or miss for some people, as would a long handle for other people.  I like the ergonomics of this product and I think others would as well.	13
About the only thing she wished was that the basket part was deeper, and perhaps an inch wider, but it certainly works as is.  And, the quality of the product is excellent!  She compared to the one it replaces and there really is no comparison.  She had bought that old one at a store similar to K-mart, as an example.  It had lasted her about 12 years but then the basket separated from the flimsy edge holder.  I fully expect this Good Grips unit to last the rest of our lives, it's so sturdy and well made.	13
I followed the recommendation of Cook's Illustrated in buying this. The corer is so much better than the half circle corer I used growing up. Solid handle is easy to grip and gives you enough torque that it feels almost effortless to use. The hardest part is aiming the thing so it goes through the center of the apple. Also the size of the core extract is a little on the small side for the biggest apples. A little of the core is left in the apple, but for normal store sized apples it works great. Highly recommended!	13
I bought 3 of the Oxo Good Grips can openers.  We kept two and gave my son one.  The first one died within a month when the black plastic tip broke.  We used the second one and again the black tip broke leaving it useless.  When I warned my son about the black plastic tip he told me that a chip broke in his but it still works.We are now using a cheap $1.99 pair we bought from Walmart. At least it opens a can, that is more than I can say about Oxo.OXO Good Grips Can Opener	13
The &#8220;OXO Good Grips Multi-Purpose Pastry Scraper Chopper&#8221; is very sturdy, cleans up easily, and is excellent for cutting yeast dough without tearing the gluten strands. The 1/4&#34; markings on the 6&#8221; blade are extremely useful since, when directions call for specific sized pieces, the markings save having to estimate size.  Further, because they are &#8220;engraved&#8221; into the blade&#8217;s surface, there is little danger of scrubbing off the markings.  The cushioned grip is comfortable to hold.  If you bake frequently, the &#8220;OXO Good Grips Multi-Purpose Pastry Scraper Chopper&#8221; will be a valuable addition to your baking tool collection.	13
My daughter 1 year old really likes this book.  I bought it because of its similarity to the 10 little ladybugs book.  It has the same sort of colorful illustrations and I like it better as the ladybugs are not as pretty as the sparkly butterflies.  This book teaches colors as each of the butterflies finds a place to stay for the night.Update - My daughter is now well grown but this book sticks in my mind still - we read it so many times.  I would say it was one of her very favorites when she was young.	13
We were initially disappointed with this machine.  We tried recipes out of the booklet that came with it, the Ben & Jerry's book and another source.  The ice cream was just OK.  Something along the line of what we could pick up at the local convenience store.  Then we tried the recipe out of Christopher Kimball's The Desert Bible.  Hallelujah!  Creamy, rich, just what we had hoped for.We had a similar experience with our bread machine.  Mediocre results until hitting upon a great cookbook.  So, don't blame the machine too quickly.  The fault may lie in the recipe book.	13
This jar opener was one of my favorite gifts from my bridal shower!  I was sick of using those rubber pads; not only did they tear easily, but also they didn't work very well.  So far, OXO's version has been a big improvement:  the little metal grips easily take hold of most lids, and with a simple twist, the lid is off cleanly and neatly.  I have found that the unit can sometimes slip, especially with a very small lid, but if you use it carefully and on a firm surface, you should have mostly success, as I have.	13
This scoop has a nice edge to it that lets the scoop dig down deep no matter how hard your ice cream is.The no-slip grip on the handle is easy to grasp and not nearly as thick as some I have tried.I would of given it the full 5 stars if I could make it scoop out perfect balls of ice cream but either there is a trick to it that I haven't discovered yet or my ice cream is frozen too hard.All things considered, this is a quality item that will get lots of use in most kitchens.	13
A well equipped kitchen should have three veggie brushes including a firm bristle brush for old potatoes, and a soft bristle brush for mushrooms. Many of us have small kitchens with limited drawer space and prefer to simplify when possible. There is no all-purpose veggie brush but this one comes close. This small medium bristle brush can easily be held in the fingers to apply heavy pressure on old white potatoes and a very, very light touch for mushrooms. It is perfect for most everything else, including the easy removal of silk from fresh corn. It is a keeper.	13
I bought this and have been using it on an almost daily basis for about 2.5 months. The white and black looks chic, the rubber base helps hold the bowl down so things are not splattering all over the place. The size is enough for a family size batch of pancakes, or for washing a few cups of rice. The plastic is very durable and it does not stain. I have used spices and oils in it, but no stain...the tip of it is perfect for pouring. its a really great and durable product, well worth the price :)	13
I use this tool every day and love it. It's very well built, simple, functional, easy to use, and only takes a few seconds to clean. What more can you ask for? It's really a time saver and makes eating apples more enjoyable because you don't have to deal with the seeds. It also cores pears.To use it all you do is line up the center of the apple, apply a little pressure while turning the handle slightly and it takes out the core with very little effort. If you love apples and pears, this is a must have tool.	13
I did the math, and for all four books it will cost almost $8!!!  What?!?  These stories are just way too short for $8!  You can get 2 full length novels for that amount!! (shaking my head) I like to finish books even if they suck, but I refuse to pay that much.  My frugal heart just won't let me.  Not only that, but they aren't knock your socks off hot.  Sigh...	14
Non-stop plot, which doesn't mean the plot is that bad: it's just all there is. No character development. But then, when the plot, which is the only thing carrying the story, gets predictable, it becomes completely uninteresting. The sample made me buy it, but it's not worth reading. Less than halfway through you know what's going to happen. And it does. Also extremely graphic in its violence. Will turn your stomach. There are better serial killer stories out there.	14
This book is a reissue of an old one; the author was born in 1910. It's of the era of, say, Nero Wolfe. The introduction was quite interesting, explaining who the author was and why he's been forgotten; I'd never heard of him.The language is a little dated at times, like calling a gun a &#34;heater.&#34;  I also made good use of my Fire's dictionary to look up words like &#34;deshabille&#34; and &#34;Canarsie.&#34; Still, it was well worth a look-see.	14
Eve Carmichael writes letters to co-worker Sean O'Callahan, stationed in Iraq as a reservist.  Their letters become sexier & sexier until she doesn't hear from him for 3 weeks & she's very worried.  Her best friend takes her to &#34;Male Call&#34;, a Chippendales-like show for her 30th birthday.  Sean surprises her as he performs with the male dancers.  Hoo- Rah!!!!  They get married & are very happy!!  Who wouldn't want their sexy guy to do a striptease for them!!!!!!  GREAT STORY!!!	14
"I enjoyed this book.  I've read reviews on it where some said they were offended by the fact that ""a black woman could be sold to a white man"".  The story wasn't anything dirty like that.  And, that would be a fair argument if this wasn't a plot that has been used many times by writers with characters being the same race and, no one complained.  So, to those people I say don't read IR books if you're against IR relationships."	14
"It's THREE PAGES LONG...Okay, it's more than three pages, but not by much. I downloaded this for free from Amazon for my Kindle. I'm sorry I didn't pay more attention to the reviews on Amazon, I won't be purchasing any more romantic ""freebies"" unless I pay attention to what I'm really going to be getting which is a very short PART of a short novel.On another note, this story was forgettable for me. I am glad I didn't waste my money."	14
Let me first say, if you have a weak stomach do not read this book.  Jack Kilborn has a wicked sense of evilness.  The main characters are so fully developed it could easily give you nightmares.  However, if you can stomach it, I loved this book.  Actually, its more a short story, with long lasting effects.  But with it's evilness, there is humor.  I found Jack Kilborn style of writing intense, and so thrilling.  This book is horror, at it's best.	14
"I had the feeling based on the title that this was not going to be a piece of fine literature, but ...well...it still disappointed me.it has potential.  there is an intriguing back story of the ""hero"" belonging to a group of powerful spies known as the Archangels, but that aspect is barely even fleshed out.Speaking of flesh....That's basically all this book is.  There are much better offerings.  I equate this to a Cinemax after dark video when it so easily could've been so much more."	14
"I love romances that are ""real"" and this one is so very real. The characters are not larger than life, they have pasts, things they regret and dreams they have forgotten. They are real everyday people with everyday problems.When they find each other, their feelings re-awaken who they used to be and help them stand up and be that person.I loved this book, it was beautiful, sweet, sad in places and oh ever touching, watching the changes that true love brings to their outlook on life."	14
As with the previous books, Geary manages to save the day.  The book is faithful to the premise and ends about as I expected.  It is a good read and I went through it in short order.  The only reason I gave 4 stars is that the premise is a bit overdone.  The characters are good, but I would have liked to have seen a bit more development of some of the lesser players.If you have enjoyed the series thus far, you will like this one.	14
All in all a great read. I would have given this book five stars except there were some repetitive thought processes in the beginning that had me saying 'alright already - I get it... he wants to stay but he's afraid she'll recognize him and reject him or turn him in'. (reminders would have been okay, but perhaps less wordy ones) However, by nearly half way in the book it moves away from that. There's plenty of action and suspense throughout, and a nice romance to boot.	14
I bought this set and returned it.  I couldn't force myself to finish the first book, A Touch of Silk.  ( They are bundled out of order, too).  The writing and phrasing was so immature that I thought at first it was a satire!  But the pages and pages of supposedly erotic fantasy stuffing the book to bring up the word count was the final blow.  No character development, not enough background.  What should have been interesting read like a pre- teen fantasy.  Don't waste your money.	14
This book was a little slow in the beginning, but once the killing started, I had a hard time putting it down.  The kindle edition is a little rough due to some formatting problems, but it was definitely readable.  Williams does a great job with character definition and more than makes up for what the book lacks in plot.  The author's descriptions of violence are so well done that it is easy to visualize the gory details.  For fans of gratuitous violence, this book does not disappoint!	14
I started reading this book with a bit or trepidation but that all fell away as I got to know more about Duke and Mav. College roommates for four years, they play hard and are fiercely competitive.And that's where the fun starts.What was supposed to be a game turns into much, much more. The writing was excellent, the love scenes believable. I found myself smiling throughout, egging Mav on to cross that 'gay' line. It's not a long book, but it packs a punch. Check it out!	14
Even for an essay, this is startlingly devoid of information and features a lot of repetition. It does not offer any reasoning on the topic that cannot be culled from any of the hundreds of full-length books on the topic, and the conclusions have already been reached elsewhere many time. If I wasn't agreeable to the subject matter or those conclusions, this would've easily rated a one-star review; but at least the author had the guts to put it out there - I'll give him that for chutzpah.	14
While I wholeheartedly agree that the lenghth of the book is disceptive that should not detract from an excellent story.  Give the publisher hell they deserve it.  Back to the story, it was great.  The author explores the fact tha HEA does not come without set backs and challenges.  The love of Z and Bella proves worthy of these challenges.  The story of the plastic surgeon and his wife was beautiful.  They are characters worthy of the series.  Inspite of its length the story rates a great read.	14
The second book on the Wizards trilogy continues well, as the Daughter of the boy in the first book finds her way to Kimyra to deal with troubles left over from her father's visit years before.  Using her knowledge of Earth technology, she rapidly becomes a capable user of that left by the ancients, and thus the Red Wizard by local standards.  Along the way she learns important lessons involving lying and responsibility.  A good series for a teen to read, and not too bad for an adult.	14
This has to be the worst erotica I have ever read!!  The story line is all over the place...in one scene they are talking about a sex fantasy and then the next line she gets the phone call that her son died.  Just no rhyme or reason to any of the scenes.  Most of which weren't good anyway.I would be upset and want my money back, but I got it as a free download, so I can only say it was a complete waste of my time.Don't bother.	14
The name did not strike me as familiar, but I took the plunge anyway. Well worth the effort too, I might add. A classic author of Golden Age, or perhaps just post-Golden Age sci-fi. Really, Piper might be the missing link between 'high' Golden Age space opera and post-WWII cold war fever. I feel like I knew this author before, once I had read him, even though I am fairly certain I never read any of his stuff when it was originally in print, or out of it.	14
Honestly I read this book because I got it free on Kindle - through my iphone.  This book introduces you to Jane, a submissive, who becomes celibate after she finds out her Master is a married man.  She attends a BDSM themed birthday party, with her best friend.  The book, couple of short chapters, covers only one night in the weekend.  You have to purchased the next to books,Educating Jane Porter: A Jane Porter storyandReinventing Jane Porter: Jane Porter Series, Book 3,to get the rest of the weekend.	14
Fantastic story lots of suspense and horror throughout this book.  Story about young boy witnessing the death of his parents.  Raised up to be a master of combat and skills in masking himself and cloaking himself in darkness.  He goes after the men that killed his family.  This man Belgad is a powerful king of the city. The story has lots of suspense and horror and magic throughout this book.  Will be reading more of this authors books, they are fast paced and very hard to stop reading.	14
"Book 1 of Granite Lake Wolfes - Wolf Signs is just great. The use of a character who is deaf and very independent is wonderful. Robyn Maxwell is delightful and just what Keil needs as a mate. I'm so used to ""Perfect"" wolves that having Keil's brother be a clumsy wolf was a great idea.This story was a great lead in to the series and while it's not a long read, approx. 90 pages, the price is good and there are at least 5 other books. Love it!"	14
I decided to read this because another reviewer likened it to Kitty Thomas's Comfort Food, which I really enjoyed....I didn't enjoy this one though- not at all.  The main thing I detested is that you never get into the minds of the captors- they're all portrayed as hardened sadists with no compassion.  There's a lot of punishment and not much insight in to the characters personalities (or lack there of) or motivations.  Comfort Food gave me a lot to think about...this one went out of my mind immediately, thankfully.	14
This book is a good start to the trilogy. The author develops the world and the characters in it well. Both main characters were likeable, but the problem was that I really didn't feel any passion between them. They could have simply been buddies with no intimate relationship and it wouldn't have affected the story. I was very disappointed with that aspect of the book.Regardless of the fact i found the characters lacked chemistry the story is unique and flowed nicely. I would consider reading more of the series.	14
Well what can I say, Ms. Hubbard never disappoint. Her novels leave you wanting more and more. There are so many twist and turns that you don't know what to expect next. I truely enjoy your novels Ms. Hubbard. I think I have ordered all of them, and I am in the process of reading all of them. Please keep up the good work, and keep the novels coming. I thought that Stealing Innocence I was good, but this one is even better. Now, on to the next book.	14
I do agree that I would like to have spent more time with these characters. I was very bummed when it just ended, and i do agree it could have used more depth. But I really loved these characters. For what they were, in the length given, they popped. Book reads very much like a brilliant fantasy. Like all her stories so far, the story has a sweet quality to it, but very hot. I thoroughly enjoyed it for what it was and look forward to more from this author.	14
I'm sorry but I did not like this book at all. The author obviously has talent, the plot and weirdness just didn't do it for me. I feel as if I am writing a Dear John letter---it's not you, it's me. Everyone has different tastes, but this whole book was...I don't even know where to start without spoilers. It could have been a much better book without all of the over the top elements, at least for my tastes.Who knows? What I dislike may go over well with someone else.	14
The plot of this book sounded so incredibly interesting, but when I started reading this book...where did the plot go? It seems this is yet another book where the 'plot', such as it is, is merely an excuse for a romance book. I'm not a fan of romance books so normally I avoid them. However, when a book is promoted as scifi with a great story I feel it's misleading to the reader. I know I was very disappointed and will not be picking up anymore books by this author.	14
The story idea was sweet, with a hunky editor who is trying to convince his prized writer to start writing erotic novels.  Given that this is a new genre for her, they engage in a little erotic research under the premise of helping her writing.  I liked the characters and the scenarios, but I expected a bit more eroticism and a little less sweet.  It seemed as though the sex scenes were a bit on the vanilla side compared to other books in this genre.  Still, a light and entertaining read.	14
I picked this book up to read in the evening, intention was to just 'start' it. But darn it, the beautifully written time travel pirate adventure had me glued to the spot -- a real Midnight Oil Burner! And can you say hot? HOT! This baby is smoking hot...pearls, that is different way to wear pearls. Just saying!  Yeah, if you like your sexy romps, and enjoy reading smut with time travel, then you're probably going to enjoy this as much as I did. And isn't that cover delicious? Oh, my.	14
A complete collection of works by one of the greatest storytellers of all time, Mark Twain. How could you possibly go wrong? Whether it is paddling down the Ole' Miss with Tom and Huck, or gleaning wisdom from a letter to the Poultry Raising Society, the opportunities for great laughter are endless. So grab yourself a glass of sweet tea and a pipe, find the most comfortable chair on the porch, and let Mr. Twain take you back to days gone by when there was always time for a good story.	14
The Good Stuff:This was a terrific story.The writing was some of the most skillful I have seen in a very long time.While reading it, I actually wished that our prisons were like the one in the story. Crime would definitely decline.The Bad Stuff:I would have liked a little more explanation in the end, perhaps a final visit from the warden.Overall, a terrific example of the writing skill of this author. A longer work of his that readers might enjoy isPARALLAX.Length: Short Story - 406 LocationsRating: R for violence and adult situations	14

I liked the creative ideas, the making and building of items.  The whole story was great...except for the killing of so many animals.  the book was written at a different time in the history of the world, the language is interesting to read and understand.  To distroy so much when now we need to save out plantet hurts  to read and think about.The book is worth the reading...as is all of this authors books.Naturally we would perfer he not kill the leading mystery man and the many life forms.The writer was a genuis.	14
I love this series. The Westmoreland' s are a beautiful family. Each Westmoreland story is romantic, selfless, family oriented, and so full of love. I love Brenda Jackson's love stories, ( if you can call them that, because to me they are equally about family bonds)but, she does get a little repetitive with wording her love making scenes. I would still give her 5 stars on the story writing because I do love her take on romance, however, the editing of this five book set was awful. Need to use a better editor.	14
I read books from mostly small not well known and usually independent authors.  I am one of those type of authors so I like to support my fellow independent and less known authors.  With that being said, I have read some not so great books from independent authors.  They either needed content work or grammar work.  This is definitely not one of those books or author.  It is well written and is a great story line. It is about overcoming extraordinary odds and winning against an opponent who is far more technology advanced.	14
"I really enjoyed this whole series, and wish there were more.  I also read the Bear one, and can't wait til she comes out with the next in that series, which kinda continues this one.  They aren't too long, but neither do you feel cheated by brevity.  This one involves an eye doctor and a legally blind puma with ""ex issues"".  There is plenty of intrigue and hot protective feelings going on.  And I really especially enjoyed that these books all allow further glimpses into the characters met in previous books.  Very enjoyable!"	14
I am so glad I purchased this. Robyn Maxwell is deaf but doesn't let it stop her from doing the things she loves. When her brother has to cancel out his back country ski trip with her, she decides she can do it by herself.When she meets wilderness guide Keil, things start heating up. Now she has to deal with wolves, mates, and Alpha challenges.Robyn and Keil are absolutely precious together. I'm glad I ignored the three stars, and purchased it anyway. The novel was a lovely surprise, and a pleasure to read.	14
I picked this book up because it was free,and I wanted it for reference material. I already know how to tie a large portion of the knots in this book. My biggest problem with this book is that a lot of the pictures didn't load or wouldn't load. Since you can read how to tie a knot it is not to terrible a problem if you know how to tie knots. But someone who doesn't or is a beginner will have problems. All in all it is a good book and is very informative.	14
This is a brilliantly executed biography by a Polish Jew who survived the Holocaust. He documents unimaginable horrors. He immigrated to Israel after the war, and later to the US, where he led a successful life. Had I know of this book when I taught high school history in San Diego, it would have been required reading. The book also provides an interesting history of the early settlement of Isreal. The comments by other readers regarding the poor formatting must have been fixed. I saw none and found the writing to be highly professional.	14
Boatman's got style and vision. The vast majority of the stories in GOD LAUGHS WHEN YOU DIE are wildly inventive and unpredictable, cleanly written and forceful. Some of them will make you a little... uncomfortable. While the subject matter is deadly serious, there's a strange undercurrent of bleak, bleak humor here as well, the kind of humor you cling to when faced with ugly truths that can't be denied.The only thing keeping this from a 5 star review was the somewhat messed-up formatting. But despite that, I'm looking forward to more from this author.	14
"I finally read this book last month and enjoyed every chapter. It shows how they managed to survive on the island by making tools and items in their cave. This book is by far one of the best ""stranded on an island"" books you could hope for. It is probably one of Jules Verne's best. The inhabitants of an island are banded together and when they get into a tight spot, there is a mysterious force that always helps out. This force is not revealed until nearly the end. I highly recommend it to everyone."	14
"OK, I have to admit that I was a bit skeptical when I saw this ""free"" book written in the 1800s.  I wouldn't exactly characterize myself as a learned reader of literary classics.  I had just received my Kindle and figured, what have I got to loose?I was absolutely pulled in by this story and had problems putting it down.  It's a captivating mystical love story about an Egyptian princess.  This was the first Haggard book that I've ever read and I will definitely download his more famous literary works to read in the future."	14
Just finished the second book &#8220;View To Kill&#8221; in this very sensational storyline, what can you say about characters that are so well written that they grab you from the beginning and not let go even after the story is finished.  This story maybe short but it is a joy to read, to devour and not want the story to end, the character of Sachin was terrific, he saved her, watched her as she matured into a fantastic women, and how he loves her, he definitely has a wonderful match in Paige, a perfect pair.	14
This is a short story that give you an insight to the series of On The Edge .. Brett owner to a club that not only caters to Vampire but humans as well.. and his girlfriend of 11 months... And how Leo well you gotta read...There is a M/M, M/F, M/F/M scenes not graphic...I found the book to be interesting and different... Looking forward to reading the rest of the books in the series...I received to book for an honest review and with being a spoiler I found the book to be 4 stars, thanks	14
The sad thing is that so many have forgotten the works of H Beam Piper. Along with Robert A Heinlein and Isaac Asimov, Piper wrote within a consistent future history. His works are intriguing and a good lesson in history, with depth and references to keep serious readers involved. It's a real pity the cycle was never completed, as the gaps left his histories a little fuzzy (in joke for HBP fans). Reading his works emphasises what a tragedy that the world lost such a talent so early, as this is quality story writing. Enjoy	14
Great book.  I always like fairy tales.  For some, the tales are a bit morbid and not suitable for children of today.  Guess I am not sure what I have been told that.  I guess the reason is that TV is the primary culture-resources input allowed by parents and society to pickle the minds of today's children since there is no requirement for an education that would allow them to read?I recommend Grimm because the stories allow those that can read the opportunity to exercise their mind in the &#34;original&#34; virtual space (imagination).Get it!  It's free!	14
"These four books are some of Crusie's earlier books so they are shorter than most of her newer novels and the plotlines are not quite as well developed but her trademark humor and loveable characters are present in spades! These books are all great summer reads and at $10 for the set this is a steal!I think ""Getting Rid of Bradley"" is by far the best of the four followed by ""Strange Bedpersons"" and ""Charlie All Night"". ""What the Lady Wants"" is the weakest of the four in my opinion but it is still very readable.Enjoy!"	14
No love here. If you are looking for a quick tale of lust with LOTS of sexually explicit language, go for it! If you are like me and don't mind a good sex scene as long as it means something, than this book will be just as disappointing for you. It was a short book, author's writing style, not bad. Premise not so bad, but for me the lust never really evolved for me. Hero started out as a rich selfish bastard, and did not change enough for me. Not enough love or depth of character.	14
Although only novella length this story has a wonderful combination of wit and the supernatural.The main character finds himself in the middle of a Troll quest. A quest that threatens to reignite a war between a Troll clan and the undead.This doesn't bother Markhat in the slightest though. He manages to navigate any rough waters no matter how many holes his boat might have.Tuttle has a way of telling the story, it just flows with such simplicity and yet at the same time has a layer of unrefutable humour that pops up and makes you grin.AVP-UK	14
Such a shame that leaders controlling people elders etc are still wounding the body.Numbers of Christians that leave churches because they haven't. Found a way to cope with the pain of betrayal by those who are suppose to love them.Trusting in the power of God to change the situation until you know it's time to change churches take courage.This book maybe the answer to staying open to Gods purpose for you helping you work through the feelings and anger(at times) don't leave God don't stop loving God just because the waters are muddy in the church.	14
"This story was pretty good.  Not too much paranormal, but just enough to keep you interested, along with a really well thought out plot.  The main character, 16 year old Jesse is a run away who has had more than his fair share of hard knocks.  He has some pretty cool abilities that help and hinder him in this story.  Like other books, you can see the foreshadowing of a possible happy ending that most authors would take.  I'm glad Lowe found a more ""real life"" type scenario.  A good ending that I was not expecting."	14
A town that does not appear in the maps, a missing totem that is needed to save it from outsiders and a love story between a sexy shapeshifter and a woman with special skills make it an entertaining read despite the characters being a bit flat for my taste.There are a couple of very sexy scenes including a hot threesome; I just wish the author  developed the relationship with Burke's brothers a bit more, because it ended when it was getting really good, but overall I think there is potential for the next books in this series.	14
Likeable characters and engaging story but the way the main characters suddenly became mates was a little too fast for me.  I prefer romances where characters work somewhat to get their happy endings since that aspect makes it more believable to me.  Still the characters here are very likeable and the story flowed well.  For the price of the kindle book it is a very good buy and worth keeping.  I will read the next story in the series and hope Amazon makes the third book available soon.  If not the third book is available at booksonboard.com.	14
I usually enjoy books by Ms. James, but this book I found to be boring.  My attention kept drifting elsewhere.  I thought perhaps if I closed the book, and returned to it later, that this would solve the problem.  Nope...it wasn't that I wasn't focused...the story was just boring.  Even the sex scenes were blah...I skimmed them!!! I also don't understand why this is labeled as an anthology...there's only one story in the book, unless the excerpts of other works are included under the definition of an anthology.  The story ended at 88% of the kindle content.	14
Allan Quatermain is the final adventure of that hero as penned by the magnificent H. Rider Haggard.The beginning may the best I've ever read.  Who else but Haggard would start a story with the death of the main character's only child.  There is an amazing battle as well.The middle dragged pretty heavily for me.  However, that was redeemed by a thrilling finale.  Umslopogaas is a character that reaches out and grabs you, and his finale suited him well.  I have to think he was one of Haggard's favorite characters.Grab the free Kindle version, and you won't regret it.	14
If you are into werewolves then this one is for you! Keith and Abby's story is one that had to be told. This story does build a strong Alpha male into someone I would want for myself, but left me a tad disappointed with the Alpha female. Her struggles to be as strong as she should didn't ruin the overall effect of the story line, yet having read the entire series I was glad to see that Moira Roger's wasn't done with this female character. I truly enjoyed this and would recommend this one as definite summer reading!	14
The plot of the story was very promising.  The first several chapters kept me interested and I couldn't wait to see what happened.  But that was where the problem lie.  I felt like a waited and waited and waited to see what would happen.  About half way through the book the dialogue became utterly boring and I didn't think I would ever reach the end. When I did reach the end, I felt let down. The grammar was pretty bad so if you are not able to overlook errors you might not want to even try this one.	14
I agree with others who say the writing style is awful.  Painful even.  Lifeless sentences and tired descriptions.  I wanted everyone to hurry up and be killed so I could be done with it.  There was no mystery.  The fun of a murder book is trying to figure out who did it.  With no plot twist, I knew very early on who the culprits were, and only finished reading in hopes that I was wrong.  All of this combined with the rude responses to other Amazon reviewers by the author and I'm done with this guy for good.	14
Brett, the human and Lisa, the vampire, are quite the couple.  They are the owners of &#34;On The Edge&#34; bar and they're looking for another bartender.  Along comes Leo looking for a job but before he can apply he sees Lisa and she sees him.  Old lovers who forgot why they were no longer together.  Can Lisa talk Brett into letting Leo share their bed?  Read this steamy short and find out if Brett and Lisa gain a bartender and a third in their bed.Kallysten does it again!  Fabulous steamy short stories that leave you wanting so much more.	14
There was NO basis for their love. He humiliated her in front of people who could have helped her cause and asked her for a night with him!!! She had been working for months to get where she was and he just wiped it all away. I know he fixed it but it was his mistake to fix, he was not being sweet about it because he caused the issue for NO reason!!! She forgave him the very next day and that night, they are MADLY in love and a marriage proposal is a day away!!! Ridiculous and unbelievable!!!	14
"Love, love, love this book. The author did a wonderful job writing this story. I think the three of them are perfect together. There will be funny moments that  will make you laugh. I love this book so much that I purchase a book and the ebook as well and I have read both forms multiple times already. I definitely am looking forward to reading more books from this author. Her latest update to this story ""ever after"" was also beautifully written and introduces new possible characters for a new book. Can't wait to see Paige McKellan next book."	14
"It is now $2.00 at Amazon.And it is only 2137 locations.""Lost in a reality only he and Anna inhabit, Joe finds himself falling in love with his intended victim, and ultimately fighting to save her life-because whoever hired him still wants her dead.""and""Warning: This title contains explicit sex, occasional bad language and extreme violence perpetrated against crash test dummies.""I liked the SciFi premise. The story was actually shorter than 2137 locations.  There was a lot of explicit sex for the length of the work.But a fun read.  Don't bother though if you have a problem with the explicit sex."	14
3 short stories (although one is more akin to a novelette) in one reasonably priced volume that really delivers!I thoroughly enjoyed the adventures of Wistril, Kern, and Sir Knobby. Easily some of the most enjoyable short fiction that I have read in quite a long while. Humor, adventure and fantasy with a real beginning, middle and end. Well written and very entertaining.Anxiously awaiting the day that Mr. Tuttle sees fit to write a novel length Wistril & Co. adventure. As good as this short fiction was, it certainly left me wanting more of this wonderful character and his friends.	14
I enjoy when the main characters have a long history together.  This was the case in this novel.  I also enoyed the correspondence (through the use of letters) between the main characters.  It was a nice way to communicate the story in the first third of the novel.  With that being said, this novel added nothing else new to the romance genre.  The plot was a bit predictable and the ending was (as always) wrapped up perfectly in a nice neat bow.  Not too realistic.  But if you are looking for an easy beach read, this one is for you!	14
I read this entire series and really enjoyed them. This last book was better than I thought, based on the reviews I read. Wasn't really necessary to go along with the rest of the series, but I enjoyed it and usually, I like to read all the books in a grouping. I read books so fast that sometimes by the time I write a review I need to go back and jog my memory. This is definitely worth the read and especially if you have read the rest. I cant say its the best of the bunch, but try it.	14
A cowboy, Christian Mystic struggles to survive the double curse that a family of evil sorcerers have placed upon his family while he is also struggling to save his ranch and  hind a place in his life for the girl that he loves in spite of all common sense.The writer uses alternating first person voice, and the feminine persona rings slightly off key.  Strangely enough many passages of the book have a very feminine poetic quality.  The author's plot resolution is one of the best and most unusual examples of the incorporation of Christian Mysticism, and redeems the stilted dialogue.	14
This was a different type of read for me.. Specially because it left more questions than gave answers. It could have easly been a whole story of friendship turn into a love story as it definitely had everything else to make it great all on its own. Elysia and Darien were really cute and I would have like to hear more about their friendship before the collapse. I'm definitely thinking about getting the actual trilogy which apparently is set in the same world as this story.Jeri Smith-Ready's Aspect of Crow trilogy: Eyes of Crow, Voice of Crow and The Reawakened.	14
"Rick he loves his mate and he cares for her, ""he growled at her wince as she stepped forward. ""You're in pain."" Belle she gives as good as she gets especially where undergarments are concerned, ""she nearly groaned as she realized he'd be walking around commando all day. She looked down at the panties in her hand, then looked back at him. With a smirk she tossed them onto the bed, then pulled on her own jeans. His groan was music to her ears."" Still have to say Simon and Max's stories are still my favorite out of this series."	14
The characters are very one dimensional and easy to predict.  As such the book was a straightforward easy read, and for the price on the kindle I am not horribly unsatisfied.  Characters are littered throughout the book who are brought to life through the entire book only to serve some minimal purpose at the end and then the characters are removed.  There are budding relationships that are awkward and seemed forced.  All in all, worth the price, but I wouldn't read it again nor recommend it to another with all of the low priced novels available on the kindle currently.	14
There is nothing here that's remotely interesting beyond the travelogue of Australia. The author calls it a romantic comedy; for the life of me I could not find a single thing that was funny - only boring. The book seems like an attempt to preach some sort of message about love and relationships, but the the characters come across as two-dimensional, too serious, too predictable, too stilted, too artificial, too asexual, too pure. Honestly, if I ever met somebody like Drew I'd get as far away from him as fast as possible. He'd bore me to tears. She probably would too.	14
"I like Joe Hill's other books/stories and looked forward to this Kindle short-""My Father's Mask"". Wow, was I ever disappointed. If you want to read a story that seems to be the beginning of a book that is never solidified or brought to any semblance of a conclusion, then this one is for you. And I enjoy ""quirky"" stories, ones that don't give the reader the expected outcome (such as the O. Henry stories) but this is just wrong. It's as if the author is trying too hard to be ""deep"", but the storyline was too strange for me to enjoy."	14
I really wanted to give this 2 stars because there was a lot of things that pissed me off. Did every man in this book have to have &#34;that water and grease type of hair&#34; as she called it and green eyes and dimples? So annoying and you want me to believe that she was that good at sex that every man wanted to wife her down and give her and her kids the world after sleeping with her on the first night? Very unrealistic but it was an ok read and it wasn't all short so that was a plus	14
I read Stealing Innocence I and enjoyed it  minus the many errors. So I thought I give the second book in this series a try and encountered the same issue, too many errors. The author must proofread and edit the books herself. The errors in the second book was worst than the first book. Every page there were misspelled words and grammatical errors. The storyline was okay but a little far fetch and Lethal Heart is just plain arrogant. Someone need to teach him a lesson. I hope the next book in this series is written better than the first two.	14
I quit reading when I realized that this wasn't a full story in itself.  I have read series before that at least held their own story for that book and continued in others.  But I was half way through this book and quit.  I just found out the story line when I was half way through.  That doesn't bode well for the ending.  It will be a huge cliff hanger for sure and I don't go for that when reading.  At least it was free on Kindle since I would have to pay alot to continue the story if I chose to.	14
There are books that you read that you can put them down and not pick them up for weeks on end. Then there are those that you just can't wait to turn the next page. Doug your book meets the latter. Since purchasing it on my Kindle last week, I've almost completed reading it in within 1 week timeframe. That's a first for me. Even with some of the big names It normally takes 3-4 weeks for me to finish reading them. Mr. Farren please keep the series coming, you've got a dedicated fan who loves reading your G.A. series of books.	14
Great read.  Yes we know Cody had a tendancy to make it more of a story and less of a report, but still a very readable and enjoyable book on the plains life.  I agree that it really trailed off at the end and we did not get much of a glance of the traveling show years, perhaps because that was so often wrought with financial problems, other than that it was good to read this again since I had not read it since early teen years.  And on kindle it is $0......can't beat it if you like reading about the West.	14
Jules Verne has a knack for detail.  This book has a good plot and a mystery not solved until the end.  This keeps one reading even though it is a very tedious chore.  Similar with many writers the object is to keep wandering around many irrelevant ideas to add &#34;texture&#34;.  I suspect most readers read a line or two each page in order to make some headway into the story.  One also has to accept absurd achievements similar to a James Bond movie.  It's better to read this than some sex novel written by someone with a demented mind.  Lynn in Jacksonville OR	14
Whoever wrote the synopsis of the story did not read it.  She wasn't trying to drive him away with sweetness.  She really was sweet.  Though apparently not to sweet to casually give away her virginity.  But give her credit she is smart enough not to mention it to him and get away with it.  No real point to telling him.  I know some readers felt that she should have remained a virgin because of the time period.  But unfortunately girls have been talked out of it by the wrong guy throughout history.  Nothing new on that front.  Anyway still a pretty good story.	14
This was really fun read. It was also hot! It's Valentine's Day the day before your wedding and you find out the ex you really haven't got over is coming to the wedding looking for closure, but it causes old feelings to stir up for both of you. The morning of your wedding you wake up and it's Valentine's Day all over again. This happens to AJ and Cooper they relive the same day over and over again. It's amazing what you can learn about people when you relive a day over and over again. Will they grab this second chance at love?	14
Maris' story is 2 1/2 stars for me, the bump to a half star owing to the gathering of the family at the end. The story, unfortunately, suffers from telling and not showing plot details. The chemistry between Maris and Alex suffers from this as well. The reader is thrown into the present without adequate descriptions of past meetings and attraction between the couple. (The suspenseful aspect to the novel also suffers from this.) Flashback scenes would have helped tremendously. Those familiar with the Mackenzie Family books expect instant attraction between the hero and heroine, but it's just not developed in this one.	14
Or just a Christmas romance to make you crack-up! The opening scene in the book is a mishap that pretty much sets the tone throughout the whole book, and yes many of us can relate. The main thing about any of these romances is that there are a number of lies and misrepresentations throughout. Is there such a thing as a romance that's honest from beginning to end?Okay I loved this story so much that I really don't care, but I think it's sad. Anyhow this book was heartwarming and funny! I highly reccomend it to anyone looking for a nice holiday read!	14
This is a cute little quick and I mean quick story. The plot or concept are 2 people writing each other and falling in love.  i must admit in the beginning the author includes the letters that they are writing each other.  For me it got a little annoying but it doesn't matter. Sean was crazy sexy and I loved Eve's personality. If you are the type that wants to feel connected to the characters on some deep level then this might not be for you as it's fast paste. The sex is a thumps up it was quick but still a thumps up.	14
Although this title only costs $1, I still expected an ending. The sample was good, but I wish the Author had made the story a lot shorter, and then perhaps there would have been room/time to actually write a proper ending.Be warned if you like the sample, be prepared for a lot more of the same thing over and over and then the story abruptly ends. I wish I had simply stopped with the sample, but I thought what do I have to lose - it's only $1. In retrospect my time was lost. I have so many other titles waiting to be read.	14
The Amazon's Curse built on relationships and events that developed in The Vampire's Bride by Showalter. The book can stand alone but is so much better if you know the back story. My rating would have been different if I hadn't already connected with the characters while reading the previous book.The Vampire's Bride focuses on Layel, king of the vampires, and Delilah, an Amazon warrior. However, we are introduced to many other characters, including Zane & Nola. I was happy to find out how their story ended.I would not suggest using this book alone as an introduction to Showalter's writing. You'll be missing out.	14
This was a short sexy story about a woman who finds love when she's out seeking revenge. I loved a lot about it. It was hot. It was sweet how quickly people's feelings changed. Unfortunately, it also stretched beyond the believable with how quickly those feelings changed.In a span of a week, a complete alpha man goes from bachelorhood to being deeply in love and willing to wait years for the woman of his dreams. A woman who has stewed over being wronged for years allows herself to develop affections for the man who wronged her.It's a nice story. It's also a bit ridiculous.	14
The real star in this book is the author.  The writing, although somewhat baroque, is fascinating.  This is the product of a real wordsmith.  Considering when this was written and what the subject matter is, it's hard to put down.  The story, however, is a bit primitive.  I read the story before I found out they were making a movie of it.  Unfortunately the movie was a box office bomb.  If the film is true to the book, I can understand that because I don't think many would have read the book first and the real joy is in the writing, not necessarily the story.	14
Although I am not a fan of Sci-Fi, I enjoyed this book and will look forward to more from this author. Small town characters, good writing, a little horror, a little medical, it's all there. I'm a little old for things that are too far fetched and unbelievable so I found the tree goddess thing a bit too much for my tastes. He writes like Stephen King in his younger days, and I was reminded of Pet Sematary as I was reading this story.I'm sure we will be seeing a lot more of Mr. William's work in the future and I, for one, can't wait!	14
"My 2 year-old son loves almost anything Elmo, so this was a no-brainer.  This was the first Elmo's World DVD I bought for him, because he loves dogs and farms.  It turns out, though, that the baby segment is his favorite.  We like to sing along with ""Old MacDonald.""  Now that we have Tivo, I could have just recorded the last 20 minutes of Sesame Street every day, but this DVD was a nice addition to our library."	15
"Despite one reviewer's comment, I think it is for children, as well as adults, because it brings back the true meaning of Christmas.  There's nothing ""scary"" about the movie.  It's just a beautiful story that everyone, including children, can relate to in some way.I saw this movie when I was a young child and I never forgot it.  It had a huge impact on me in a great way.  It's a true Christmas classic, which is a rare thing."	15
"Though it's been a while, I recall this as being a rather excellent film.  Peter Chattaway tells us that ""disparate elements are woven into Joseph's story without sacrificing the film's dramatic unity; the result is unexpectedly coherent, even poignant....[It]is about as rich a three-hour epic as one could want from television: complex, challenging and convincing, it has enough emotional power to draw you into its world and enough realism to make you want to stay there (Review: The Bible Collection, Patheos(dot)com, 1996)"	15
Love seeing these cartoons in PERFECT re-mastered condition and bright colors.  Over the years, they have aired on channels including CARTOON NETWORK in washed out 16mm prints.  I would have preferred that the original titles remain, BUT at least they did put the original open to the series for each UNDERDOG episode.  All in all...a GREAT DVD set!  For this box set, CLASSIC MEDIA also re-did the covers for VOLUME 1 &amp; 2 and they are much IMPROVED!  Rick Goldschmidt  RANKIN/BASS Historian	15
"I should have left this review a long time ago. I could kick myself for buying it, thinking it was a film, not a religous object. If you critisize this film amongst religious radicals, you risk being burned at the stake, an act of love to purify your soul.This film,as a film, disregarding the topic, is a dog. A cheap ""B"" grade, blood spurting, flesh flying horror flick in Aramaic with sub-titles. I could go on for an hour, but won't bother."	15
"I received this DVD yesterday and watched it immediately. Having seen part of it on TV, my initial feelings were confirmed. This is the best movie rendition out of the 4 Jane Eyre movies I have seen. Ciaran Hinds is fantastic as Mr. Rochester; as I always pictured him, dark, loud, brash, demanding, but hurt and helpless with regard to his situation. Mr. Hinds's acting in this movie prompted me purchase Jane Austen's ""Persuasion"", starring him, and I find it excellent as well."	15
I borrowed this set from a friend and couldn't get enough of it. A great collection of episodes, like the well written (and provocative) &quot;A Touch of Brimstone&quot; to the dead funny &quot;What the Butler Saw&quot; and the toying-with-your-mind &quot;The House that Jack Built&quot;. This set provides a excellent, varied taste of the show. I recommend it to everyone, but if you really love the show, I say just buy the Emma Peel Megaset on DVD! (now that's what I want for Christmas!)	15
The Emma Peal years are the highlight of a great series, and a pinnacle of television history.The transfers are gorgeous and bring new meaning to the term 'glorious black and white'.  The stories are fun, clever, witty.  The dialogue is classic, and the delivery from the co-stars elevates it even further.  They, in turn, bring new meaning to the term 'cool'.I loved every minute of it.And, speaking of cool, have a look at Danger Man with Patrick McGoohan.  You gotta love those Brits!	15
I've seen this one three or four times on Speedvision. Kind of ruthless toward the women but conveys the style of the Hell's Angels. Too bad about Adam Roarke. He was a good guy, a pretty good actor, stunt man and.... well he died a little before his time. I could call myself a biker but my Kawasaki Z1R although quick doesn't quite fit the image of a Harley Davidson. Some how Jack Nicholson just doesn't fit in either. Sonny &quot;Ralph&quot; Barger sure does!	15
"Excellent film has many gripping and brilliantly realized scenes throughout.  I am sure many people are going to be divided about this film although I do not believe that it is anti-semitic in the slightest.  It will be very violent to some.  I thought that Gibson directed the film amazingly.  The acting by Jim Caviezel is astonishing.  Well shot cinematography and musical score.  But I can't say that it is the best religious film I have ever seen.  That title still belongs to ""Ben Hur""."	15
This is a tough workout.  The basic workout is 45 minutes and the challenging workout is 50 minutes.  If you're already in great shape, this will be a good workout for you.  If you're a beginner or intermediate, forget it.  This is something you need to work up to.  Kathy starts at high speed and stays at that pace.  Also, you have to learn the moves on the fly, which makes it that much more difficult.  Final analysis, good workout but only for advanced students.	15
This is my first Kathy Smith video and I think my last.  While the music is fun and encourages you to move, Kathy Smith herself has the opposite effect--she is cold and out-of-place.  The workout is not by any means challenging--that was the reason I selected this tape over others.  However, if it THAT basic even for someone like me (not a lot of exercise experience, no dancing experience, and not particularly good coordination) and it is not that much fun, then what's the point.	15
We have loved Upstairs Downstairs since it first aired--40 years, can it be that long?  We own the complete series on tape, but now that we are no longer young, we will repurchase this release because of the subtitles, which add so much enjoyment to Americans for British programs.Unlike many other reviewers, we care little for bonus material--give us the meat and give us the subtitles.Now if they would re-release Jeeves and Wooster and Rumpole of the Bailey with subtitles, our cup would runeth over.	15
"I purchased the first issuance of USDS when it first came out.  I returned it five times only to find out that the glitches were in ALL production issuance.  When I heard that USDS was to be reissued ""digitally remastered"" I was over joyed.  I have made it through about one half of the series.  It has been repackaged, but don't expect an improved picture quality. SHAME&lt; SHAME A & E for a rotten reproduction of one of the best mini series of all time."	15
Wonderful ,program, heartwarming story, and the sh?^[EST PRESENTATION YET..  This dvd is not restored...one...sengle.bit.  It is the same dark, muddled, dirty, bespeckled and trimmed copy we've seen on tv , video, and dvd, for what?  forty years?  I was taken in, amazed and ecstatic that my favorite holiday special would now look as wonderful as it deserved to.  I'm tempted to take it back, but at least it's on a stand-alone dvd, instead of added as an afterthought to some Rankin-Bass collection of more &#34;famous&#34; specials.	15
"Christ is to Adult...as Santa Claus is to Child. What kind of sick mind would let their kid watch this pornographic trash? The kind of person who thinks ""Jesus"" is going to ""come back"". The type of person who believes MILLIONS are going to ""HELL"", if they are ""unsaved"". The fact that this MYTH of Jesus and the Bible continues to hold sway the world over is nauseating. This religious nonsense has gone on long enough. Throw this sick fantasy away and instead use common sense."	15
Loved, loved, loved this new take on what was one of my favorite TV series of all time.  The characters were beautifully drawn, and the plot(s) of each episode made me remember just why the original UD was so wonderful.  I miss Mr. Hudson, but there are compensations, and every episode is a little gem.  I just wish I could count on years and years of new episodes.  In the USA we don't have any idea how to make this kind of TV, more's the pity.	15
She annoyed me so, that I had to stop watching a couple of time, but she also made me return as other annoying characters did. I loved the acting... anytime I truly dislike an actor, they are playing the part well. There were dual parts to ever character, as their are in real life.  The first 40 minutes, I thought this movie version, Vanity Fair,  was simply rubbish.  But, I really enjoyed it to the very end and loved/appreciated the outfits the characters wore in it.	15
The movie is very vivid and emotional. I don't like to watch violence, but I think in this case it shows exactly what our Savior went through so that we can have salvation. It adds meaning to it. It's very difficult to watch because of how awful they were to Him, but it depicts the love of God for us, thus strengthening our love for Him. He made that ultimate sacrifice for us, so now it's our turn to make our sacrifices for Him, even unto death.	15
This is a loose version, some things were added that were not in the book, much was left out.  but a book such as this would have to be a mini-series to remain true.  That being said, I like this version.  Ciran Hinds never disappoints, and is so handsome.  Yes he's stiff in the movie, but so was Edward in the book.  I like it, and will probably buy this version, maybe.  still a couple more versions to see before I select one for my personal library.	15
Good films on the Revolution are hard to find.  This one was packed with action and the drama of Washington's last roll of the dice when the odds were so severly stacked against him.  The film is truly worthwhile, if only to further instill some patriotism in your kids and remind yourself what our ancestors went through to gain our independence.  And Washington would be a hard character to play:  unless your Jeff Daniels.  He nails it and truly captured the heroic aspects of that great man.	15
Condarman is one of Disney's more brilliant films in the last few decades. The story has the taste of Peter Sellers classic &#34;Pink Panther&#34; movies and that special &#34;80's&#34; movie magic that hollywood hasn't been able to replicant since.Superhero films are big in Hollywood right now, though I doubt they'd make a reboot of this movie a part of me is glad they won't. This classic can hold it's own without the need for any blockbuster A-lister or CGI effects.Buy it. Watch it. Love it. Thank me afterwards.	15
Meggido. Just the name is enough to make somebody  shiver with fear.This WILL happen. What happened on September 11 signaled the beginning of the end of the world. VERY timely in light of the tragic events that have been happening. Thank you to EVERYONE who worked pon this movie. EXCELLENT MOVIE. POWERFULL. GRIPPING. SPECIAL EFFECTS THAT WOULD'VE PLEASED Cecile B. DeMIlle. Once you see this movie, your life will NEVER be the same. In an instant, the silence is shattered and all hell breaks loose. Are you ready?...	15
Okay, so I'm reliving the past with this classic... And classic it is. If you're a sap over the holidays, and still expect the jolly big dude, to be coming down your chimney on Christmas eve, then this is a video for you.As a matter of fact, three of recent Santa Clause movies that really get me into the spirit are the Tim Allen movies by Disney: The Santa Clause 1, 2, and 3. Great movies (along with this classic) to watch on a cold Winter's night...The Santa Clause	15
Somehow I missed this 1997 sleeper until I caught it recently on late night TV.  I have since ordered a copy of the video to keep and an additional one to share with friends.  You can read about the plot elsewhere so I won't re-write it.  The main character (Chad) commits such acts of cruelty my jaw dropped.  It is so politically incorrect (the interview with the black employee)my jaw dropped.  There are multiple surprise twists, up to the last minute.  Funny -- disgusting -- heartbreaking.  Watch this one.	15
This short film is a parody between Shakespeare in Love and Star Wars. The main plot is about young George Lucas in college and he's trying to come up with a great screenplay. Throughout his daily activities, we see where he gets his inspiration. Even though I didn't see Shakespeare in Love, I was still able to get most of the jokes. This is a VERY funny film and is worth watching over and over again. If you're a Star Wars fan, you might also want to try Hardware Wars.	15
Roman Britain? Not quite. A fun foray into Hammer's skewed history? Definitely. This film works on the most basic level. Warrior chicks and Roman villainy with a mad druid for fun. The best acting in this little  sizzler comes from that late great charactor actor Patrick Toughton. There  are moments when it seems like he is in a completely different film...yes,  he's that good. Andrew Keir is not to be missed as the scenery chewing evil  centurion. A mediocre effort at historical film making, but a great deal of  fun!	15
First of all, this wonderfully hellish movie is bloody bloody bloody! I have seen this a couple of times and it just keeps on getting better and  better everytime! That one guy that gets 7 inch razor sharp demon nails  buried deep within his poor ol face is very very sick! Ouch! There are so  many great highlights in here, you just have to see this to believe it..  Great gore, excellent atmospheres, and ugly, UGLY looking demons, all of  this makes up for a perfect horror movie. BUY THIS!	15
Fabulous adaptation of this classic film with Samantha Morton's superb acting. Actually all the actors in the film are just wonderful. Brian Blessed should have gotten an Academy Award for his performance as Squire Western.  He was humorous, horrifying and tender - at times, all at once. A splendid piece of acting.  I actually do prefer this to the other more well known version of the film with Albert Finney. The filming itself, the costumes and truth to the original writing make this a far superior filming of Tom Jones.	15
The passsion is the best movie about JESUS. It is far better than those syrpy bible movies insstead of ignoring the cruelty of the time it shows it in graphic detail. Jim cavezi is better in theJesus role than any one. the beatings are grusome  the crusifiicsion  is brutal with every detail shown. one inaccuracy is the damage to the templle the Bible says the curtain between the people and the highpreist was torn nothing else. the passion is the best if you havent seen it get it or rent it.	15
The moves are similar to those found in the Tae Bo routines.  However, the intensity of the workout is significantly less than the Tae Bo workouts.  This workout is great for the begginer or as a primer for Tae Bo.  Kathy  does a nice job with the instructions but performs akwardly compared to the  other instructors.  The music is decent and they are always in sync.  I use  the video as an alternate to Tae Bo either as a change of scenery or on  days when the energy level is low.	15
My daughter, who just turned 1, has been an Elmo fan for a little while now. This is the only thing with Elmo that she doesn't like. She wouldn't watch more than 5 minutes of it. It's much different from other of his videos. It's more scripted and less animated than his normal segments. I think it would be more popular with 2 or 3 year olds, especially if they're familiar with Cinderella. I loved it and am saving it. I'm sure my daughter will warm to it in the upcoming months.	15
I love programs of this type. I thought it was quite enjoyable, despite the feeling that it could have been given a more in depth treatment. The Crossing by Howard Fast, upon which the program claims to be based was more of a rousing tale. To be fair, I generally am always a bit dissapointed when I view a movie based upon a book after having read the book, I generally prefer to find books listed as the source for a show I enjoyed, which always provides for me an enriching experience.	15
I had first started to watch an older version of this story and was not a fan. I stumbled upon this newer version and loved it from the very beginning. The characters are interesting and provide good back ground for what is to become. Some lie, some cheat, some are naive for a time. Learning some history is a bonus. There are so many parts of history that are fascinating and yet rarely talked about. Appearance for appearance sake is always a theme in life, especially for the well known and well off.	15
If you are not a fan of Mel Brooks, this comment is not for you. This Collection has the best of Mel Brook's movies (it does not include The Producers, a fantastic theatre play).His sense of humor is unique and appeals to me so much that I can't stop laughing every time I see them and I have seen them again and again. Each time I find something new, a phrase or an expression I missed. &#34;To be or not to be&#34; is a classic, starring with his late wife, wonderful Ann Bancroft.	15
There is not much to say about these two movies that has not been said a million times. John Hughes has us laughing till our side's hurt in the 80's and the 90's and this one is no exception. Unlike most other &#34;lie rays&#34; the digital conversion of these two films was top notch and went well beyond just simple video noise reduction and the restored to 5.1 original soundtrack will blow you out of you seat! A must have for any video collection as it will entertain the young and the old.	15
"This is definitely the most entertaining Andy Kaufman DVD available, it contains all of his best routines performed to perfection.The Midnight Special definitely captured Andy in his prime and it's amazing that he was able to cram so much into one show.Here's what you get:-Foreign Man-Elvis-Tony Clifton(His finest hour!)-Andy working at Jerry's Deli-Andy wrestling ""the ladies""-Weird gibberish puppet routine-Interviewing Slim Whitman and Freddy Cannon-Andy with his entourage (Bob Zmuda, Bob Shapiro, etc.)Basically, if you loved ""Man on the Moon"", you'll get to see some of the same material performed by Andy himself.Buy and enjoy!"	15
"I rented this movie the other nite and can't stop watching it! It's about a group of church ladies who try to get gambling out of their town the fact that they have no clue what they are doing makes it hilarious! A couple of the funniest parts are when Barbara Harris is in the grocery store buying tons of cheerios and pretending not watch the crooks; another very funny part is at the end and they are in ""demo deby"" and the one lady breaks her nails. A good family movie worth watching."	15
The history protrade was amazing, but the actor playing Washington did not fit my view of him.  At first it was frustrating to watch him until I started focusing on the history that was being shown and then it was unbeliveable what they went through to accomplish what they did.  Also, my understanding of Washington was that he was a very God fearing man and would retreat into the woods or pirvate places to ask for guidance from God.  None of this was protrade.  With out divine intervention the victory would never have happened.	15
Dr. Quinn Medicine Woman The Complete Season 6 is the last and best chapter of the series.  There are tons of action-packed scenes, an adventure in the woods, a miscarriage, a lot of deaths, a remarkable reunion, good times, bad times, and a really happy ending to a remarkable TV Collection.  This final season will make laugh, make you cry, and at times leave you breathless.  This DVD has excellent picture quality and an interactive Menu with summaries of each episode and an option for scene selection.  A Remarkable chapter to a Remarkable show!	15
Why does everone like this movie, it's the worst Godzilla movie ever made. I makes no sense, an Indiana Jones rip-off & Godzilla gets teamed up on. Another stupied part was when Mothra and Battra were fighting, Mothra never used her laser beams when Battra was kicking here ASS, until Godzilla comes and fights Battra and only Battra, Mothra out of nowhere uses her laser beams. Heasi era ( I spelled it wrong) was a bad era for Godzilla why, most of them have bad plots. It's only worth watching once and never again.	15
"This is a really great Movie For almost anyone to SEE! It kept My attention the whole Time! They did a great job flipping back & Forth from The trials  Hosea faced during His Time (  Straight Bible ) & the teenagers & really all of Us as We met New People And realize We are ALL different ,We all have different backgrounds .We need to remember Instead of "" Pasting Judgement ASAP"" Practice  The Golden Rule! LOVE THY NEIGHBOR AS OURSELVES We might find We are going to find new friends & nice People!"	15
The series are amazing! Thank God such biblical figures are protrayed with the  Lord God as foundation.I was expecting those usual blurry versions, but this is entirely different. Its a way to invite friends and know the characters in the bible and how they can relate that man in his nature is sinful and only through the Lord's grace can we only be part of the family.  The story shows the fallen nature of man---jealousy, anger etc and it also shows that God knows the heart of men and gives according to His own glory.Watch it!	15
"One of the very best TV dramas ever made, enjoyment of it is almost totally ruined by appalling picture and sound quality. I have no idea what ""digitally remastered"" means, if this is the result. It's a disgrace to charge almost $250 for a product this inferior. I actually thought my copy was a bootleg, made by some bloke pointing a digital camera at a TV screen -- it's that awful. There is also a constant ""shadow"" track on the audio, which sounds as if someone has a radio on in the background. Just disgraceful. Avoid."	15
Mel Brooks movies all follow a similar formula. The gag lines, the sexual humor, the variety of funny, or somewhat funny, characters are here. Some movies are quite funny. Others are distastefully irreverent, and not all that funny. I tossed The History Of The World in the trash. Just be aware that Mel Brooks isn't family fare. If you're not a fan, be careful. His humor isn't for everyone, nor is it funny to everyone. Bottom line: I like some of his movies, and dislike some. If you consistently like Mel Brooks, you'll like this collection.	15
A wonderful story set in the disco era of the 1970's which stars a young Donna Summer as a struggling singer trying to get a foothold in the magical era of dance music.  Her performance of one of her greatest hits of all time, Last Dance, is a gem!!!!  She is young and beautiful here and NOT to be missed.  She is gone now, but this movie will always stand as a watermark for her great talent.  And besides that, it's just a FUN movie which is authentic in its portrayal of the 70's dance era.	15
My daughter, the Sesame Street fanatic, has begun singing her abc's because of this video.  She's 21 months old.  Big Bird and Baby Bear work on learning the abc's. Baby Bear wants to learn them because Goldilocks gets on his nerves, butting-in and finishing them for him when he gets stuck.  When Goldilocks pops in, it's pretty funny.  Not a good video if your child only craves Elmo though.  He does NOT appear in this video.  For everyone else, this is a cute way to learn the abc's and have fun with them at the same time.	15
this is from the series of books that spawned the wizard of oz film.in this one,the lion must find the ultimate icon of good or something to that effect.i belive its a flower.dorothy is along for the ride too.the witch has a evil icon that spreads evil to everything it touches.only the flower can stop the witch.the kids like it some.its a fantasy/adventure type deal.the wizard of oz movie was far better than this cartoon.ive never read the book but i think it would be quite excellent.id love to see the other books turned into films also.	15
This is a great Woody Allen film.However, it is only 85 minutes long, just like every other release.The description claims uncut 91 minute version. There is no extra material.It is widescreen, but I have to compare it side-by-side with a VHS version to acertain if making it widescreen cuts off the bottom and top of the picture.All special features are only written text and only in Korean, so virtually no special features unless you read Korean.Don't buy this because the description claims uncut version.It is not.It is, however, a really funny Woody film! Buy any domestic release.	15
I bought this movie when it first came out on DVD.  I just noticed I have not rated it so I will do that now.  Watch the movie if you have not seen it.  Everyone needs to know what our Savior went thru to pay for our sins .... when He was innocent of all sins.  Jesus suffered horribly for the sins of mankind. All we need to do is ask Jesus to forgive us of our sins and save our soul. He made that possible for us by taking on our sins.  Watch the movie.  Please !	15
Wow. My cousins and I are from a small town in Illinois and when Cable hit in the 80's, it was a revelation...and this is among the classics we watched over and over and over and over and over...you get the picture.I'm not going to bother outlining even the slightest of plot points as that has been done nicely by everyone else. I just wanted to chime in and pay my respects to this GREAT movie. It's good to see how the '80's has bonded us all....By the way, Harrold's team rules and Melio is my childhood hero.	15
It's a fun piece of italian horror but let me first state that many reviewers here have gotten it wrong. This is NOT a DARIO ARGENTO FILM. I love Dario Argento films (Suspira, Phenomenon, Tenebrae, Opera etc.) but this is a Lamberto Bava picture. It has a totally different feel than an Argento movie. Mostly it's a lot more campy and the photography is not nearly as stylized. Also this is a good movie to rent but I don't think it has much replay value... I'd store this under watch once or twice and have a good laugh.	15
A serial killer in early 20th century New England is murdering disabled young women, and it looks like his next victim will be a mute girl (Dorothy McGuire) working as a live-in assistant for wealthy, non-ambulatory Ethel Barrymore. Mrs. Warren urges Dorothy to leave that night during a drenching rainstorm, fearing the worst. The 'clues' all point to Mrs. Warren's youngest son.Surprise, the killer turns out to be her much more urbane oldest son. The 'good news' is that Dorothy gets her voice back and marries the young doctor who has been trying to get her to treatment.	15
Well produced script and story of the man we have come to know and respect as one of the great minds of our time! Enjoyable, considering all they tried to pack in from childhood to fairly current times of his life it flowed fairly well. These types of movies tend to be a bit rushed and corny but the writers,cast,director,editor etc. did a great job! I would recommend it as if focus' on his rise to becoming a downright genius of a surgeon etc. and skips his current personal politics so anyone can pick it up and enjoy it!	15
This is the first time I ever saw these three guys playing guitar. Satriani, Johnson and Vai. Each of them play 3 songs, and at the end they all unite and play together 3 more songs. This DVD is killer. The quality of the sound is just so good that you think you're listening to the CD. I sometimes turn on my surround sound and play this DVD and makes me think WOW! This is a must for any serious fan, or for anyone who loves guitar music. If I could give it a 10 stars, I'd give 10.	15
I wish someone could comment on the picture quality of the DVD.  I have purchased about 20 DVD movies and rented countless more, and I thought all of them looked just fine.  This is the first one I have come across whose picture resolution/sharpness resembles that of a slightly worn-out VHS tape.As for the movie, Samantha Morton was a wonderful Jane Eyre and Ciaran Hinds was a pretty good Mr. Rochester. Knowing what I know now about the DVD, I might still have bought it because I love this version of Jane Eyre and don't have it on videotape.	15
I enjoyed it but was disappointed that even though i chose 55 minute option cardio- kickbox workout sort of stopped at 30 minutes, she then worked our legs for 5 minutes? Then that other guy did training of some sort that I skipped, then another training....which wasted 10-15 minutes and then there was cool down.  The good thing about this DVD is that you can select to play certain segments....only one segment can be played at a time though. Warm up was good. Good 10 minutes but cardio type with some stretches that I didn't do- I skipped rope instead.	15
"I am 48 so I was in the ""right"" age range when these movies came out and I saw all of them. I not too long ago purchased Night of the Demons--I liked it way back when and I still like it.  So I was feeling a bit nostalgic and decided to purchase this one  . . .I threw it in the trash. . couldn't get into it at all. I know other people rated this highly and I read their reviews before I purchased this one. .but for me, it's one of those movies best left in the past."	15
This movie was very hard to watch because His death WAS very ugly, yet I personally believe it to be accurate with what the Bible says.Although I don't know all the beliefs in all the Religions,I have read the Gospels in the Bible, and it seemed the movie played out just as the Bible read.The movie only focuses on the last 12 hours of Christ's earth life.And although it is hard to watch, It's a great reminder of the Gift that was given to us all.The performances are nothing less than spectacular, and I found this movie to be deeply touching.	15
...I lived for some years in a former British colony in Africa.  While there were some differences in my experiences...(my time was in the '70s) the vast majority of the series brings back many memories....I could completely identify with the main character when confronted with a matter involving superstition... Out of his depth and beyond his experience... but critical that he gets a grip on it... and learn from one of the locals......This is one of only a few series that I would give six stars if I could.  Most people who buy this series will be absolutely delighted with it...	15
Upstairs, Downstairs: The Complete Series - 40th Anniversary CollectionThe new and very limited series (if you can call three episodes as series) is so underdeveloped you barely get to know them.  It is well done as far as acting and sets but leaves fans of the original series wondering who they are and what are they doing with the Bellamy home.  I did not understand why they would make only 3 programs.  It certainly left me wanting much more time to develop the characters.  If you have not seen the original series you will wonder what all the fuss was about.	15
William Thackeray's classic novel about the opportunistic Becky Sharp (Natasha Little) and her climb toward social prominence receives the BBC treatment but fails to become more than an interesting, well-acted soap opera.  The entire production seems curiously flat and misses many opportunities to comment upon the parade of human vanity on display here that lends the work its title.  Becky's final actions in the last moments of the drama appear to conflict with the personality that has been established for her over the course of more than five hours.  Still, it is an enjoyable production and the cast acquits itself well.	15
Usually the first movie is the best one, and here it is true.  Ghidorah was always my favorie film in the Godzilla series.  We have some great monster battles, well detailed sets for destroying, and get to see Ghidorah with the meanness he's meant to have, only otherwise seen in Destroy all Monsters.  Both versions are very clean both visually and in audio.  The dubbed version is probably the one we all grew up seeing... with a lot of the added in music which, I feel, adds greatly to the film.  This is the copy all Godzilla fans ought to pick up.	15
I really wanted it to be a great romance and it maybe would of been had it not stopped all the time. I eventually stopped playing all together in my player. That was with the first disc. I can only say that the romance I thought was going to be there wasn't. Or at least not to my liking. It is about a young doctor that falls in love the head doctor of the hospital with his wife. He tells her that he loves her and that is as far as it went, because that is when it started to stop playing.	15
Although perhaps not my favourite film version of the novel (and given the fact Wuthering Heights is a very, very difficult novel to film), this is a great adaptation of a phenomenal book. Some of the casting is questionable, but some characters were perfectly cast (eg, Sara Smart as Cathy Linton is exceptionally talented!). The symbolism of the windows was represented quite well and with subtlety. It would have been nice if, instead of making up their own scenes, they had filmed more scenes directly from the novel, but overall, this was a great adaptation of the novel with some wonderful imagery.	15
I only watch horror movies. I'm 100% a horror fan, and the trash put out these days are highly disappointing considering what I am used to. ANGUISH is a pure classic-highly underrated, very talented, highly imaginative with a great plot, thrills, chills, some nice gross out scenes-and SUPERB ACTING!!  Yes I've seen hundreds if not thousands of horror movies and I have seen this one at least a dozen times-and NEVER have I ever gotten tired of it. THIS MOVIE IS A GREAT TREAT!!! IF YOU NEVER SEEN IT-YOU MUST!!! YOU SIMPLY MUST!!! I wish I could give it a hundred stars.	15
"This is a wonderful old British TV series but buy the TWO volume set for a better deal:Avengers '67 - Set 1, Vols. 1 & 2(It doesn't say so at the top but this set IS ""Set 1"".)You can check out my full review of each episode there as well as my other more general comments about the series.Also, be aware that when you buy the TWO volume set, it comes with an additional cardboard (very nice) packaging to hold together the two Plastic DVD cases in one unit. This cardboard packaging has all the details of both DVDs on the outside."	15
"If you like Christmas movies besides ""The Nightmare before Christmas"", you should add this one to your collection. If you don't like Christmas movies then buy ""The Grinch"" or ""The Christmas Carol"" and see what you act like Grinch/Scrooge. In my humble opinion this is the best telling of Rudolph's story in a musical. Many added side stories with Hermey the dentist, Yukon Cornelius, Abominible Snowman, and the Island of Misfit Toys adds to make a great story. The animated figures are excellent and smooth motioned. Excellent narration by Burl Ives. The music is first rate and will have the family singing along."	15
I have both version's of the Passion of the Christ. But the Definitive Edition is better because it take out a few scenes. One part that isn't in this edition is right before the flogging scene starts, the 2 guards that bark in each other's face isn't in this film. This movie is highly emotional because it's the truth about what really happened. If you're looking for answers in life then please watch this film and then turn your whole heart,life, and soul to JESUS CHRIST THE WAY, THE TRUTH AND THE LIFE (John 14:6). God bless to all who watch this film.	15
"Honestly, all individuals are born different from the other. In G3's situation the 3 of them have their own distinctive feeling & style in playing that would obviously lift you up from your seats and scream out loud the word ""Yeah"". That is why I would not and could not classify who is ranking no.1, 2, or 3 among them. Unless, if your head is inflated with fowl air then approach me and I'm 100% willing to deflate your pathetic medical case and grant you guarantees of cure comprise of ""Love & Respect"". Buy this Dvd because your in for a special treat."	15
I remember my parents let me stay up late one night to watch this movie and for three months after that, I had terrible nightmares.  After all, I was only 6 years old when it came out.Now to this day, when it's dark outside and the night is calm...then a sudden gust of wind comes out of nowhere, I have that close-up image of that Lincoln's grill flashing in my mind.While by today's standards this movie would be considered a joke, the little 6 year old inside of me is still terribly thrilled that this movie is finally making its way to DVD.	15
"I loved this as a kid.  So I figured I'd get it for my kids.  And they liked it too, despite the hilariously hokey special effects (hokey to them), so that's why I gave it 3 stars.But for me, for all the christmas specials, this is the worst.I couldn't believe the ""Sit on my lap"" song.  Really. Some strange creep comes to town and trades kisses and lap sitting for toys - he should have been arrested for that alone.And then the way they tied everything to the song was really irritating.  Plus, why did the young man have an old man's voice? Annoying."	15
I am a big fan of Monica Belucci but that didn't get me to see this film till a year later after it came out. It is a silly movie. Nothing realistic about it. Pasolini's The Gospel According to Matthew (1964) is a far superior film. I think you have a hard time trying to make a popular entertainment and trying to tell the truth simultaneously, because people will prefer fantasy and cliche over truth and beauty. It's telling that most people who bought this DVD also bought the Star Wars DVD. Star Wars must be one of the biggest myths of our time.	15
I bought three of these because the story is exactly from the bible. I used the Bible to follow the story. Why did I buy three? I have a son in law that every time I watched this, Jesus reminded me of him by his actions with people and his love of children. The other was for a neighbor who is not of my faith but has the same Christ likie values, I expect all who proclaim they are Christians. I bought this also because I am tired of looking at all the poisonous traditions on TV that is making the world more evil.	15
"ANOTHER American cultural icon from the 60's has beendeemed unacceptable by those who would prefer to seemalice where none exists.Not even Underdog can escape the slings and arrows ofthose with the same mentality as the book-burners of1930's Germany.Why do we allow such obvious Orwellian ""Newsspeak"" toedit our past?

To anyone who, like me, only really began to appreciate Buckley's amazing songwriting and delivery after his untimely death, this DVD holds the rare look at the man in the very intimate setting of the Metro in Chicago.  The  concert was orignally taped for a local Chicago music program, giving it a  very intimate quality.  The ENTIRE show is here, all the banter between  songs, the calls from the crowd.  The DVD is excellent, two seperate sound  mixes, regular CD quality PCM and a remixed Dolby Surround 5.1 mix.  Two  bonus acoustic songs and a press kit round out the DVD - worth every penny.	15
I am a mother of a 10 month old. She started watching this when she was 8 months old and just simply loves it. I can put her infront of the TV turn it on and a lot of times she will sit and watch the whole DVD! As you know for a 10 month old that is  unusually! But she loves it that much! I have a Nephew that is 2 years old and he just loves it as well! I recommend any parent out there that wants a educational fun Video/DVD for there child ages 6 months- 6 years this one is GREAT!!!!	15
RecklessOkay, I admit to being more than a little prejudiced here.  I absolutely LOVE this DVD!  Even ten years on, it has all the charm, drama and poignancy of the first showing on Masterpiece Theatre.  It's the story of young Owen Springer, a cheeky (and sexy) doctor transferred to a Manchester hospital who falls in hopelessly love with an older woman (Francesca Annis) who just happens to be his boss's wife.Steller performances by Green, Annis, Michael Kitchen, David Bradley, Julian Tutt-Rhind and Connor Mullen take this comedy/romance/satire to a new level of entertainment.  Don't miss it or the sequel, also on this 4-disc boxed set.	15

All of Argento`s Trademarks are Here:Violent Murders, A Complex Plot and a Pulsing Synthesizer Score all here in Abundance. Cinematography by Luciano Tovoli (Single White Female) is the Film True High-light of this One. Cleverly Done. Grade:B+.	15
I'm a total beginner so I don't really know if my review will be useful.  I have nothing to compare these too except my Lee Oskar.  They sound good to me...that's what's most important right?  These do have a kind of nasty &#34;new car smell&#34; to them, but I'm leaving the box open to see if airing them out helps.  It's not a big deal, but it's the only negative I can find with them.  Rock on bro!	16
I love this system.  Every time I change strings now, I go through every step of this system, and what a difference it has made.  The fretboard cleaner and conditioner are great.  I never realized how dry the wood was.  The string cleaner is nice too.  I feel like I was neglecting my guitars until I got this.  The quantities of product in this kit are good, and the instructions are clear.  The two polishing cloths are adequate size, and washable.	16
Without going to extremes and spending two-hundred bucks on an NOS tube from 1957, I recommend for us frugal individuals to go the cheaper route until you get your first platinum hit.JJ's tubes are well-trusted and have become the defacto standard when selecting quality and tested reliability.BTW - 12AXT and ECC83 are the same tube.I can't remember the last time I had a JJ tube go microphonic beyond control.I have played full time for over 27 years. I use these.Hope this helps.	16
This is what it is... A super cheap mono cable. It should be sufficient for many needs and is cheap enough that thin wire gauge and such can be forgiven. Just be aware that it is cheap and unshielded, etc.For the price and intent, I almost gave it 5 stars. But it's not a 5-star cable... It's a fair quality ultra cheap cable. 4 stars seems about right. (Yes, this is almost exactly what I wrote about the other Hosa cable I reviewed.)	16
These picks seem well made and have a solid feel, but I'm not sure I like the sound of them.  Like so many other guitarists, I go through a lot of picks, searching for what feels and sounds the best for what I do.  I don't this is it for me--at least not on acoustic.  Whatever I didn't like about them got drowned out when I tried electric.  Since I've been playing more acoustic lately, I might or might not buy these again.	16
"I kinda strayed away from the Elixir brand for a little while just ""To See"" if another brand would sound ""better"" and in doing so, I wasted time and money.(but I did get some EXPERIENCE) I'm back with the Elixirs now and have no intentions to ""Experiment"" any more.Simply put............Elixir makes the best Strings for an Acoustic Guitar that I've tried and I ""Will Stick with them"" because they have Great Sound, last a long time, easy to clean and prevent rust and/or corrosion."	16
If you need a simple, normal-length strap, this should work fine.  However, if you are tall and like to sling the guitar a bit on the low side, this is not what you need.  I bought this but wound up ordering theErnie Ball 4037 Black Polypro Strapinstead.  Very similar look and feel, but the Ernie Ball is MUCH longer.  The lowest I could get this to hang was just above my waist.  Again, not a bad strap, just not for us tall guys :)	16
I have these in three guitars after trying out some undersaddle and sound hole pickups. Some peope miss the &#34;quack&#34; ,electric guitar type sound from these other types. I do not. I also like that the bridge and saddle do not have to be modified ,nor is any battery required. I run it through a Baggs Para-acoustic preamp or my Fishman Aura.It really has to be installed by a professional repairman to be sure the sensors are located correctly.Product was delivered safely and promptly.	16
"I tend to have sweaty fingers after playing my guitars.  Therefore, after playing, I always wipe down my strings to extend their life.  I've used other microfiber cloths, but they tend to break easy and leave ""fuzzies"" on the strings, which I then have to remove one by one.  This cloth is fantastic for wiping down your strings after use.  It is very well made and leaves nothing behind after use.  I liked my first one so much, that I am putting in another order."	16
i mean, sure they get the job done, but there're 2 things i'm not too convinced about.. first stability, you have to be very very careful as how you distribute the microphone's weight, and be pretty careful not to rotate it even a litlle bit, otherwise, you'll find yourself with a shure sm-58 with a dent, like myself. and second... i haven't had actually any bad experience with this, but don't seem to be that strongly built. for those 2 reasons i changed to hercules.	16
I've used the .60mm and .73mm Dunlop Nylon picks during my entire professional music career.  I rock hard. Acoustic, electric, and Bass!  I've tried almost every other pick on the market and they break far too easily.  Dunlop's Nylon picks don't break, and once you find the thickness that fits your needs, you'll find that they have excellent string attack and are easily kept in grip. I rarely ever drop one of these picks while preforming. Maybe 5 times in my entire career.  Buy these picks.	16
I was a little reluctant to try the EVO XM as I have a Vendetta and the tuners are junk.  Fortunately this guitar does not inherit this issue.It's a beautiful looking guitar with very nice setup.  Action is incredible.  Almost too low for those that do a lot of stretching but great for those that are into fast riffs.  The difference in tone between the neck and bridge pickups is great and the pickups are very responsive.Hardware is slightly better than expected for this price point.	16
What can I say? I started out with a couple of pedals, then a wah, then more, then a board for them, and sooner or later all those 6&#34; cords are either in the way, too short or whatever. I do like the male-male offset connectors to bring pedals together but sometimes on a board you've got odd distances. This kit does the trick, and truly was easy to use. Only once did I create a plug with a bad connection and had to redo it.	16
I've needed one of these for my fender amp, yes I used to spend time dialing in the delay pedal for the rockabilly/blues numbers and if my settings got messed up, well, that would slow the show down. I wish my fender amp had this built into the amp but it didn't. This pedal makes playing rockabilly on my fender simple fast and easy. Really quick to setup and use. It's not a delay unit, it's not versatile either, but what it does, it does perfect!	16
"On my mixer, I have send/returns on the same plug using a 3 wire TRS with send on the tip, return on the ring, and a common ground.  But my effects boxes like to have separate 1/4"" TR ins and outs.This is the perfect cable for just such a hookup of things like the behringer sharkBehringer Shark FBQ100 Automatic Feedback Destroyerto the 1202-vlZ3's send/returnsMackie 1202-VLZ3 12-Ch. Compact Recording/SR MixerI probably will order a second cable having seen how well the first one worked out on a send/return."	16
I got these for a parts-tele I built and I'm really happy with them.  Like all vintage tuners you may need conversion bushings to make them fit modern peg holes which are usually larger.  But they look great, work great, stay in tune and are completely vintage spec.  I have a '57 reissue strat and I can't tell the difference.  One thing I've always loved about vintage tuners is that you tuck the strings in the center of the shaft so it keeps the headstock looking neat.	16
I'm rating it 4 stars because although it is able to attach to most mic stands, it doesn't fit them all very well. Opening up for headliners, you basically get given most of your stage gear (minus your own instrument gear) so if you're given a mic stand that has a smaller diameter tube, this will not fit as nicely.  I was playing a couple shows and this thing would slowly slip down the pole (that's what she said).  Usually worked fine. I'll still recommend this wedgie.	16
This is a great gig bag for the money. It has more padding than I thought it would have, has very strong construction, and plenty of places to store stuff like sheet music and cables. The carry handle and shoulder straps are well padded and comfortable to use as well. It's even reasonably water proof, handling the light rain shower well with zero leaks. For the money, this is the best one I've bought on Amazon, and will certainly buy it again in the future. Highly recommended!	16
The hardware works as advertised and is easy to operate.  Make sure you have a good microphone to use with it.  The Cubase software also works well but the user interface and instructions are more complex that you might wish for.  That seems to be a common problem with music recording programs I've seen - heavy reliance on technical jargon that may be unfamiliar to the typical amateur singer/guitarist.  This should come with a good &#34;how-to-use&#34; course that helps the user learn the jargon and common applications.	16
I'm an amateur sound tech. We've been using SM58 in our church for years now and our singers/song leaders liked it very much than the other mics that we've had before. Our singers are growing and we needed addtional mic so we thought of this Beta58A because of the good reviews. When I received it I cannot wait to test it myself and whoaaah.. For me, it sounded better than SM58. My songleaders have tested it and guess what... they dont want to use the SM58 anymore :)	16
Most 12AX7 tubes do what the electrical engineers say they should. Psychoacoustics being what it is, I can't honestly tell you, for sure, Electro-Harmonix tubes are measurably better than the no-name Chinese tubes I replace. But I THINK the Electro-Harmonix tubes sound better, therefore they do. At $12 per shot, who cares? I suppose I could contrive a double-blind experiment to settle the existential question empirically, but I'd rather spend my time playing. Rest assured Electro-Harmonix is GOOD stuff and the price is right. Just do it.  ;-)	16
i have a tired 16 year old lefty acoustic guitar that needed some love.  i decided to replace the saddle with this one.. and it required some dremeling/sanding to get it to sit correctly.  it was easy to do - and now my guitar has no buzzing on any of the frets and it sounds great with new strings.  it also brightened up the saddle/bridge because my old saddle was turning yellow and not too nice looking.  this one is an ivory-ish color and it is really nice.	16
"I ordered this product to use for personal recording, and thought...what could possibly go wrong? I ordered it ""New,"" and it definitely shows signs that it not new. First, the package was stapled, that's right- STAPLED together in a way in which you could tell the product had been opened. Then, to make matters worse, there is a hole in one side of the fabric. When I order something new, I expect it to be new. Based on this product alone, I would not recommend buying from this seller."	16
I have owned two of these stands. The first one was rendered unusable after the set screw disappeared. The second one must have walked off on its own while I was moving to a new place. Not the greatest stands by any means, but for what they're worth, I didn't mind spending another $10 to get one. Sure there are other stands of much higher quality that are even more compact and portable. But price, ability to collapse, and it's light weight made it the one I bought... again.	16
I have moved on to the Carbon Fiber and 3mm Lexan Jazz III picks but these Ultex picks are also very nice.  They are a little less bright than the Carbon Fiber Picks which in some cases is actually preferrable.  In my opinion (At least at the moment) the Jazz III picks are right at the top of the list with the best picks you can buy.  Once you get used to the small size there is no going back.  The large picks feel like your holding a refrigerator.	16
These Fender string guides are replacing the old style string guide(tree). Installed on a Tele I built. Much less surface of the string touching. Very smooth action when using the vibrato. Took no more than 10 minutes to install.. Reasonably priced, super upgrade. I recommend this product to anyone with string guides on their guitar. These look like rollers, but are not rollers. They do work well. and I will purchase more for other Tele's and StratsPros: Well made  Cons; None I can think ofSleek, well designedQuick installImproved soundInexpensive upgrade	16
"This little box will give it to you. I personally play bass and I have a thing for long effect chains. I count in my little arsenal with fuzz, distorions, auto wah, a compressor, octaver, bass booster and a nice DI Box. The MXR EQ helps me a great deal to ""recuperate"" definition and clarity after this long effect chains that I love. A great little box.So if you are looking for clarity, definition and even a little extra punch for your sound the MXR EQ will do the trick.Cheers!!!"	16
I am totally satisfied with the stand.  I had some misgivings after reading some negative reviews on Amazon but this stand serves me well.  The misgivings I had was with the extra weight I intended to place on it with my tablet stand equipment and the Samsung tablet.  However, I am very happy to report that it handles the extra weight very well and does topple over even when the boom is extended with the mic and space needed for the tablet and guitar playing.  I easily reommend this Item.	16
I've had two of these tuners. They are well known among bass instrument players for being able to lock in on the lowest pitches better than most other tuners. They're durable and have a long battery life. Unlike most other tuners, in noisy environments they don't lock in on higher pitches before lower ones, again a plus for low instrument players.The one problem that I've had with these tuners is that one of them had to be set to A-439 to tune pitches that other tuners recognized as A=440. Strange.	16
bought this for a modest step up in vocal tracks for home recording on my 24 bit neo 2488.Ive been using the mxl990. mic would be great for the price if it wasnt defective. used it forabout 30 minutes before crackling and static started. had to go back to the 990 until all of thereturn and warranty is taken care of. i still recommend the mic though. it is hotter than the 990in its highs, but with good compression, power amp and eq the result is well worth the money.	16
"These cables give you a pure sound unhindered and uncut. I have several other ""good"" cables but when compared to this they cut highs and even the level. I have grown as a musician to the point that I Know it's worth it to pay a little more for these quality cables. Yes you can get many cables way cheaper (and I'm all for getting things at a good price - publishers clearing house has Not visited me yet!) but this is a case of you get what you pay for!"	16
Bought this as a back-up to my AT system and have only tried it in my living room. Home tests show it works fairly well in that environment although I think I hear a little distortion if I turn the gain up too much (I don't think you can change the gain on the AT system). My only nitpick is that I'll need to use an adapter to go from the guitar plug to a 1/8&#34;. For the price, it's amazing. I just hope it works in the field as well.	16
I buy and sell electric guitars and often I meet with someone at a half-way point where access to electricity is unavailable. I was surprised at the volume and tone that came out of a unit so small.  There is even and overdrive which makes this totally cool as some of my customers want to schredd a little.  This is battery operated but can be plugged in using an adapter.  I bought a Planet Waves 9V Power adapter to go with the Honey Tone.  It might work in a Busker situation.	16
alright I got tired of forking over 30 cent a pick at my local guitar store for instant gratification and decided to get some more online, and let me tell you, these picks get the job done. don't expect to be playing metal with these as they are on the soft side but work well for casual playing along with some heavy palm mutes and stuff like that. a few of the tips broke off but I think that's my fault for playing too hard :) Great picks, would recommend to anyone.	16
These picks have a very unique shape and sound that have helped me play faster with a smoother tone.Unfortunately, these picks did not receive a five-star rating because of their price and lack of durability.  They wear down fast.  Mine are usually worn out after a day of use and I don't think I play particularly hard.  At around $4.50 for six picks, these are some expensive pieces of plastic.However, these picks are so full of awesome that I am compelled to pay a little extra.  I will definitely be buying more.	16
I love a lot of Danelectro products, but not really this one, i give it 3/5 because it works as advertised.The features are good. True Bypass requires a 9v wall plug, and adjustments are good.BUT HERE'S MY ISSUE- The Distortion is not 'Crunchy.' It distorts, sure, but the sound is not dimensional... it has no depth to it.Thats fine for someone who is playing one of the various metal genres, but i play a lot of blues-rock... I ended up switching to a Vintage-Tube overdrive by behringer.Not for me, maybe for you.	16
I've had it for about a month now and it hasn't fallen apart so I guess that's a plus, but the main issue with this rackmount is that whatever automated machine they used to drill the screw holes is definitely defective, as a large majority of the holes are slightly deformed and will not take in the provided screws and are therefore USELESS.  Thanks to this problem I am only able to use TWO slots out of TWELVE.  It's definitely very frustrating and although the price is tempting, stay away from this.	16
I've been using one of these Kyser's for a good while now. I only have one so it usually stays with the mandolin but works just as well for my banjo. If you never used one, it's makes it MUCH easier to change keys although I usually only use it when I'm playing chords, when I solo I like to play with open strings and this makes it a breeze to pop off and put back on. With a little practice you'll be able to do it quickly without having the strings buzz.	16
I have a few Planet Waves products and I can safely recommend them.  This is no different, it works, I have no issues with the product, if you are looking for a peg winder,  or any accessory, I'd recommend you look at Planet Waves among your research in brands.Please click YES if my review have been helpful to you, it will encourage me to continue writing and updating my reviews, and leave a comment if you have any questions, I will be more than happy to answer if I can be of help.	16
"Absolutely no complaints about these cables.  We use them to power two Fender Squier Strats, and were very happy with the sound quality for our use.  The plugs are sturdy with injection molded guides/covers and provide good strain relief.  For the price there's no worry about solder quality, since any repair would cost you more in time than a new cable.We also use the more expensive metal cover Hosa Cables and see no appreciable difference in sound quality.Great for short connections for mixers or straight to the amp.Specs - 10', 1/4"" mono (tip)"	16
I purchased this for use with a Sennheiser E825-S microphone and the bestselling On Stage boom microphone stand. The mount has exceeded my expectations. The fit for the stand is perfect, with the mount pivoted so that the mike can be adjusted up or down. The part actually holding the mike is flexible and rubbery, making it very easy to slide the mike and its cord in and out. A screw tightens te pivot if this needs to be fixed more firmly in place. All in all, a very worthwhile and economical purchase.	16
We got this to save on trunk space when traveling with a guitar. As expected, it doesn't have the sound quality of a full-size instrument, but it sounds good for what it is. It seems to hold a tune well and my son enjoys playing it. The blue color is pretty, and we were pleased with the extras that accompanied the guitar (case, strap, etc). Other people have mentioned an odor on the case and strap. We did notice a scent, but it didn't bother anyone. A more odor-sensitive person might feel differently.	16
I have several different slides (glass, brass, steel, short, long, etc.)And this has become my go to for every slide guitar session I play on!I wear it on my ring finger, It fits great, the tone is amazing on acoustic, electric and banjo!Works great for blues, rock, a little stoner country, and even some metal! (the main genres I play in)Harmonics and sustain to spare!I keep it in my pocket at all times now, it goes with me everywhere, And has never failed to lay down some mojo when I bring it out!	16
this is a must have pedal for any rock player, tight compressed distortion sound , you could play with the EQ to get the sound your looking for, it goes from an overdrive sound to a really heavy distortion, It's build to last forever, the sustain is fantastic and the top boost give you another range of possibility's.the only downside is the battery, get the power adapter , batteries wont last more than 2 or 3 days and you have to unscrew the back to replace it.Overall, I'm really happy with this pedal.	16
String changes usually take me 10 to 12 minutes each but I restrung all 3 of my guitars in less than 13 minutes (one is a floating tremolo). The spanner is smooth, the cutter is strangely very clean cutting (usually use electrician wire dykes) and the pin puller is nothing fancy, but does the trick quickly. Awesome little tool and very impressed with it. A++++ on every function, would consider maybe putting a few small rubber inserts on the handle for those sweaty hands, but other than that, it's perfectly perfect. VERY HIGHLY RECOMMEND	16
These are by far the best value for effects pedal cables.  I find the local music stores won't stock them, forcing you to buy higher quality cables at about $7.00 each.  These cables, so far, have done the job at a fraction of the price.  We will see how well they stand up over the long-term as they are a cheaper cable.  But for the price, they are great.  At 6 per pack, you can even afford to simply replace them as they go bad and still be ahead -- if that even happens.	16
I would say this stand is for the occasional user who doesn't put more weight than a few sheets of paper on it.The top part is not secured. It just slides on the tip of the tripod. Pick it up and carry it around, it'll come apart and scratch your Stradivarius.The foot is horrible: It sort of hooks in place with a little clamp. That means, you get ONE position. And that one doesn't look like it will live very long.Comes in a pouch, which helps to put it away.Spend more if you can.	16
It's a very fair price and is made well.  It seems as though it will hold up to some kicking around.  The only thing that worries me is that once the bottom piece swiveled and dropped my guitar...and this was when I just set it down not a few seconds before it fell.  I'd recommend easing your guitar into place and making sure it's secure.  I'm not sure how &#34;on stage&#34; ready this is.  It's a good, cheap stand though and for the price point, I understand the sacrifices they made in the design.	16
"Overall dimensions 6 3/4"" x 6 1/2"" x 2 1/4"". Very nice travel size. Sound is about what you would expect. It is basically a toy. If you use more than 2 (of 10 max) gain, it sounds awful. I turn guitar volume to max and adjust volume on the amp to desired level. Tone works nicely to filter the output over all frequencies. I am using it with a Fender Starcaster when I travel for work (hotel friendly). I think it's over priced but I think it looks good and it seems durable."	16
Granted this is no voodoo laps pedal power, or another isolated power supply, but it does provide clean, quiet daisy chain power for up to 8 pedals, and does so pretty dang great for $150+ cheaper.Is it silent? No.Is it reliable? Yes.Would I use it on stage or in the studio? Yes.Would I prefer something nicer if $$$ weren't an issue? Yes.Does this wok great on a budget, absolutely!!If you're tired of using batteries pick this thing up!If you're a super quiet signal chain snob, save an extra $150 and get the voodoo labs.	16
I was looking for something that was able to bend a bit but not fall out of shape or stay bent after much use and these are great.  They have good tension but still sound nice with my acoustic and the grip is great.  It's almost like a microscopic layer of felt is on these.  It sucks when your hands are cold and the pick keeps slipping out of your fingers...you don't want to keep licking your fingers or breather warm air on them and these are easy to hold onto no matter the condition.	16
I got these picks a week ago and have fell in love with them. I generally use a Dunlop 1.0m pick, but have to switch to a thinner pick for rhythm play. This, of course, can be very annoying, especially if playing rhythm and lead parts in the same song.  These Big Stubby picks have solved that problem. They are easy to hold onto, great for leads, and because of the way they are shaped don't hang on to the strings like the regular picks do.  Great picks. Definitely worth the little extra they cost.	16
The winder makes a loud and ear piercing squeaking when winding fast. I tried unscrewing it and putting a little oil on the screw head but it didn't make much difference. I hope it goes away with use.The string cutter works like a champ. I was using a set of flush cut nips but they kept getting bent trying to cut the hard nickel and steel of guitar strings. These work much better. They don't cut the string they shear it off. I've done 3 sets of strings and no noticable wear on the cutter.	16
I never had one of these until I had to twist each tuner around 60 times to change a string.  But that's not a problem any more.I used to go through my hardware drawer at home to find wire cutters to trim my string ends.  But that's not a problem any more.And I used to hurt my teeth sometimes pulling tough bridge pins on my acoustic.  But that's not a problem any more either.All solved by one simple tool which is inexpensive and fits easily in my case.  So I'm a fan.  You'll be too.	16
Need 2 volume knobs and 1 tone, so for the price (and in the past) I have always purchased 2 packs together with no issues, however recently I needed and ordered some and I found out of 4 sets, no consistency in quality... example the lettering is thinner on some than others within the same set and between sets of the same item#. Also some had bright white lettering and others did not (but where not vintage lettering either). Guess these are too cheap for Fender to have QC on.Will try other brands next time.	16
I was pleasantly surprised of how heavy the base was compared to what I was expecting. The adjustable stand also works great and won't fall on you or anything. I bought this and a mic/boom stand for my Samson SP01 Shockmount (which the Audio-Technica condenser mic is on), however its connecting slot is a 3/8in female while this stand has a 5/8in male (same with the mic/boom stand). So just make sure whatever it is you're buying can connect properly with the stand. If not, just buy a cheap (about 6$) adapter like I did.	16
Pro Tec manufactures a variety of accessories for musical instruments.  Their low cost black nylon guitar strap, is a well constructed high quality item, that is a top seller at Amazon.  The large sized attachment tabs are quite thick, about 1/8 inch.  Although the fit on the typical guitar strap nuts is snug, some type of strap retainer would still be recommended.  Black works with most colors, and this strap should last for a long time, but it is so inexpensive, if you qualify for free shipping, you might want to consider ordering a spare.	16
This tuner works fine for the flute and clarinet however for things that use the input jack it doesn't really work. As soon as I insert any cord into the jack it automaticly goes to a very low B flat and stays there... Even if the guitar and bass are not on the other end. At first I thought it was my cord however after four cords doing this, I also tried other tuners with the same cords and they worked fine. So again works good on the sound input but poorly with cord input.	16
As stated, I use the D'Addario 9s and 10s on all my electric guitars except for theGibson LP's and I use Brite wires on those.I like the D'Addario's over the Brite wires because they have color coded balls and thismakes changing out all the strings at once a lot easier.I do not produce a lot of body acid, so strings last a very long time with me, no matterwho the manufacturer is, and I play many guitars in my collection so none of them gets heavyuse.The EXL strings produce great tone, and are great for bending.	16
A couple inches behind my bridge is where it lives and I've never had cause to remove it. At first I thought I'd hate the look of it there, but it's never bothered me one bit. Reaching for pics is never a problem. I just wish there was a size that worked well with jazz III pics. This one works with regular size pics and to fit the jazz II I have to add a regular pic in there first then put a jazz III in it works out so not too much a big deal.	16
I have enjoyed my Protec Strap. I was surprised how well made the leather harnesses are and I have had no issue with them stretching on the strap posts of my Dot Studio. One note would be that these straps are probably better for your lighter body styles - strats, teles, sgs - heavier guitars will tend to start digging into your shoulder after an hour or so. Having the pick pocket is a neat feature. I am just finishing up rebuilding a LP copy and I will be getting another for this guitar net week.	16
I got this for my Ibanez acoustic and found it was a real challenge to get it attached at the neck.  It took a few trys before I could get it buttoned so the strap would stay put.  Even so it was a good quality button.  The leather is tough and will last for years.  It will probably outlast the guitar.If you're looking for a good way to attach a strap to the guitar neck is a possible option.  Maybe if you have a Martin it might be a better fit.  But it's really worth the hassle.	16
This Guitar Hanger is good looking, well made, and was exactly what we were looking for to hang my son's acoustic guitar on the wall in his room. Our logic was that having it hanging in plain sight would be much more conducive to him practicing over having it hidden in case stuffed in a closet, and so far that seems to be the case.The hanger was easy to install (literally took less than 5 minutes to screw into the wall) and is easy to use (just place guitar in the padded holder by the neck).Highly Recommended!CFH	16
I do not have much to say about this. It does what it was designed to do and it looks fine.I found myself actually trying to see if it will rip, for the purposes of this review. Just so I could make some sort of comment about it... You can rip it if you try, but it's not likely to happen during everyday use.It's fairly thick. If that isn't what you want then I would look elsewhere. This should be fine for nearly everyone who doesn't have a very specific reason for a different sort of windscreen.	16
This is a lemon oil used for cleaning and conditioning the rosewood fingerboards of guitars. This only gets done once a year on the average guitar, so if you're like me, this one bottle will supply you for many lifetimes. Other than that, it is what it is and does what it says. The applicator contains a dispensing valve so push down hard to open it when you want the oil to flow.The label says NOT to use this product on maple fingerboards. Doesn't say why, but my guess is it will discolor them, so be forewarned.	16
Unfortunately, these tuners require drilling to fit my Squier Strat.They look very similar but the two pins are approximately 1/16th of an inch further out from the shaft so I'm going to have to drill new holes in the headstock to use them. Worse, the holes will actually touch the edge of the existing stock holes so, I'm going to have to fill them, first.The quality of the locking tuners looks great!I only wish that they'd show a diagram with the specs written on it so that I could have known that these don't fit my guitar!	16
No complaints about this hardware.  Easy to install with patience, easy to use.  The click on/off system securely holds your strap, and prevents the strap binding from slipping off the post.These work like a light switch...on/off, so I'm not sure how you can rate them as poor.  There aren't really any directions, so it takes a little mechanical knowledge (just a little...it's not rocket science) to make them work.Quality metal, secure function, and easily replaces posts on instruments already equipped with standard strap posts.I've installed these on a 3/4 Hoener, Full Sized Squire Acoustic, and 2 Fender Strat's.	16
I been playing guitar for 12+ years now. I play lead and rhythm. I needed a good EQ to sometimes scoop the sound a bit since I have a variety of guitars and they all sound different (some too much on the low and the others too much on the high). I don't like interfering with my mixer and amp settings and decided to get a pedal EQ instead. A boss EQ is solid and all yes but cost ALOT more. This EQ achieves almost the same results and I paid less! It has it's own level BTW.	16
"After about a month and a half I have noticed some corrision on the A and D strings at the 4th fret.  That is a little disapointing because these are suppost to last 3 to 5 times longer than ""regular"" strings.  I like the way they sound.  They are a little harder to play than the D' Addario strings that I am used to on my other guitar, and the Martins that I have used in the past.  If I still have to change them every 2 or 3 months they are not really worth the extra cost."	16
I used to play with celluloid picks back in the 70's before they came out with Delrin. I like the sound and feel of these picks. They add a nice round sound that works well with jazz, and funk. They are a little expensive, but I think they are worth it if you need the sound and feel of the real thing.I bought the abalone ones because they look cool...***UPDATE***I am still using these picks but they tend to break along the colored lines, and usually during a performance. I have since gone back to Delrin and Nylon.	16
"I had for years been using Elixir Strings on myWashburn D10simply because I was accustomed to them and saw no sense in making a switch. I'm glad I tried out these D'Addario strings. These strings are an excellent complement to my Washburn, which has mellowed out over the years. They are a fair bit cheaper but has a tonal quality that rivals that of the Elixir strings. I can't speak to the manufacturers claim of ""4 times more life,"" but as of now, I'd have to say these strings are a fantastic value for your money. Highly recommended."	16
I ran a few recording tests on my microphone with and without the shock mount. It seems that ambient noise is generally reduced with the shock mount on. It's especially effective when the microphone is on my desk, where my computer tower (which has 7 fans) is directly under it. It's not perfect, but the level of noise reduction really is amazing. On top of all that, it looks nice too. If you are planning to buy a condenser mic for your desk, you should definitely consider getting this, along with a solid stand and a pop filter.	16
Honestly it took a few adjustments to get it right, but now it works great.The black handle is a quick release to be used with a drum stick while playing. After a few tries I got it a good angle so it can be hit while being played.Height adjustment was also important. If the latch is to high, it will not grab the hi hat and bring it back up. Too low and it does not sound right.This replaced horrible Pulse Hi Hat hardware that shook loose every few songs, so I am completely pleased with it.definitely worth $13.00	16
"These Danelectro pedals are great quality for the money. I use this pedal behind my dirt pedals for added flexibility and bringing out some more ""brilliance"" to the tone. The case is plastic, not very attractive, and perhaps not very sturdy. Also the button to push down for the effect leaves a bit to be desired -- it doesn't feel very solid. But I intend to use this more for recording than live use, so I'm not worried about that. Anyway, there aren't many EQ's on the market, and for the price, it can't be beat. I would recommend it."	16
These strings actually save you money because you don't have to change em much. I keep em on a year or so and I play alot, out door indoor. constant abuse. they never rust. When they break I change em.now..I'm not a player who likes new strings to begin with so I like not having to change em..they really hold up. There are better sounding strings yes. But if your plugin in anyway, you can tweak the tone.The tone isn't bad, just not as good as a martin uncoated string.but if you like longevity and less squeak. these are great.	16
In 40+ years of using many Jim Dunlop products Made in America or to his standards of quality, I've never broken or worn out the capo. I use mine on both 6 and 12 string guitars. The spring tension remains strong after several years, which keeps the sound nice without the strings being muted or buzzing. The only problem I have with them, they seem to disappear when I'm not looking. I have used other brands where the rubber leaves marks or sticks to the neck with prolonged use. Other than smudges from getting the capo dirty, it cleans easily.	16
"Not happy with the sellers description or the product. The description says ""Heavy Duty"" which makes you assume that it's a regular hard plastic Mic Clip, but it's not. IT'S RUBBER!!! It sucks. Used it a couple times and it's hard to slide the mic in and I can see after a couple more uses how it's probably going to need to be taped because the swivel will become very loos cause the rubber will wear down quickly, and flex. IT'S FLEXIBLE!!! Who uses Flexible Mic Clips?!!! Make sure you don't buy this and get a hard plastic clip instead."	16
I purchased 2 of these items to use with my band for the guitarists. I was disapointed when I mounted a Shure sm 58 mic on it and found that the goose neck would not stay erect. These are made far too loose and flexible for most professional mics. They may work on very small and light weight units but for my needs they are totally unuseable. It would have been helpful to include the suggested weight that this goose neck would support in the sales description. I wasted my money. Don't waste yours. Perhaps viagra would be helpful ;-)	16
These strings are great for all sorts of playing styles. I bought a set of 9's and 10's and I also have some D'Addario 11's. The 9's are super slinky just like the name says. They're great for quick movement around the fret board. My only complaint is that they are at times too thin sounding. I play a lot of rock, and sometimes these just don't pack a punch like the 10's or 11's do. All in all though, these are great strings, and I will definitely continue to buy Ernie Ball, I'll probably opt for 10's or 11's though.	16
like title says. the item does what it's supposed to.  you get the headroom you expect from a 20 dollar item.  I love the ability to have separate control over both inputs.  I've had it for a few months and I'm experiencing some noise on the pots, which I didn't expect.  I thought it would've lasted a little longer. I can open it and clean the pots but again, I expected a little more life out of it.  battery operation would've been nice but like I said, does what it is supposed to, well enough that I've bought 2 of them.	16
I've used this on a variety of 6 strings and a few 12 strings and it really does give a good sound for the price. And if you've got a variety of acoustics and don't want to get pickups installed in ALL if them this is a great solution. It tends to work slightly better for finger picking than strumming because occasionally your hand will hit the chord coming out if you're not careful.Remember that it must be used with a preamp and hopefully something (most likely a tuner) with stomp on/off bypass so that you can turn it off more easily.	16
Best articulate bass string for the money.  I have one of the first versions of the Fender Precision Lyte bass from the 90s.  I have started to use lighter strings to keep the neck from getting fatigued.  They sound great and stay in tune.  Sound like Rotosounds.....think Roger Glover, Geddy Lee, and Chris Squier.  Nice bright and deep sound with fingers or pick.  I am not a slap style player so I can't comment on that.  I set my action fairly high to keep every thing clean as possible. Try them, you'll like them and your bass guitar neck will be happy.	16
It would be improper for me to claim that these FIT Stratocasters, because I have a Stratocaster remake and I drilled new holes for a Stratocaster pickguard to get the screws in. What I can say is that the packaging is nice and doesn't seem cheapo (surprised it didn't come all scattered in an envelope or in a ziplock bag) the size of the screws was right, the dark chrome finish on the screws is pretty slick, and it came with more than enough to install a Stratocaster pickguard. I'm sure the screws are the right length to fit authentic Stratocasters anyways.	16
These tabs are both functional (useful) and neat (attractive).  They help you keep your thoughts, papers, files, etc. organized in a neat and convenient way.  They do their job, and they look really good.  They look good in a binder, and the colors are nice.  They are also strong and sturdy.  There are 6 sets of 5 tabs.Highly recommended if you organize or have a use for them.Good for home, office, school, projects, etc.	17
Yes, you read correctly, this CAN be converted to an actual TABLE!This helps if you need a place to put your projector in a pinch.Very easy to adjust, and very sturdy.This piece is a tad bit &#34;bulky&#34; for me (I am 5'5&#34; tall, and its size competes with my size), but not overly &#34;heavy&#34; as far as weight.Quality is great, and I highly recommend it for presentations, or even just a good writing board for your office.	17
"Side-by-side comparison:3M Address Labelsare just as good, and usually less expensive. Go for the better price.I've used Avery and 3M labels for years.The 3M have the same easy-peel layout, without the laughable salesmanship.The 3M package claims ""Permanent Adhesive"" and ""Strong Stick."" The Avery stick just as well, or almost as wellI find the 1"" x 2-5/8"" size is big enough if you use size 9 font (Arial). I get up to 38 characters per line x 5 lines."	17
I've had several bankers boxes for miscellaneous storage needs over the years and even the normal-duty ones have lasted me for almost 20 years.  These aren't quite as sturdy as the heavy-duty versions, but unless you're doing some major stacking, the medium-duty boxes should be great for most needs.  The boxes are also super simple to put together.  And if you don't need all the boxes, you can keep the unused ones flat for easy storage.  Highly recommended.	17
"I have always HATED ""invisible"" tape -- I find that it tears apart too easily when you're trying to get it off the roll.  But transparent tape doesn't always look good on wrapping paper...This is the first time that I've tried ""gift wrap tape,"" and I LOVE it!  Looks great, but without the annoying tearing issues of invisible tape.  It is now a staple in my wrapping paper drawer!The only thing I'd change is...put more on each roll!  :-)"	17
"I'm always skeptical of ""clean edges"", but this product delivered.  The matte finish and clean edge gives a very professional look.  They ""snap"" out of the frame easily.  Almost too easily - you have to handle them carefully when loading the printer.  They take color well and really do look great.  You really can print on both sides without bleed through.  I used them for art exhibit tags and for my business cards.  I was very happy with the results."	17
I like the clean edge cards.  The only thing I don't like doing, and I've had to do this on other busincess card paper, was to trim the edges with a cutter.  Every time.  The calibration didn't work for me and I followed the instructions as written.If you don't mind having to trim them further, than what you need, either that, or don't use any color near the edges.  Because you may get a white strip that has to be cut.	17
For school, work, or personal organizing, these dividers make for a clear (pun intended) and concise presentation.Sturdy yet flexible dividers make the contents of any binder easy to navigate.The company even supplies a header template via their website, printable in Word and WordPerfect, as well as detailed instructions on how to do it without the template.For those of us weary over stuffing tabs into tiny slots, this clear-view format is easier and, in my opinion, has a cleaner, more streamlined look.	17
"The tape - at first I wondered: ""How can this be different?"". The answer is rather subtle ... the tape has a strong backing with a semi-gloss (satin if you will) finish. For a ""tape collector"" I guess it is slightly between ""magic"" and clear tape.* Not a big deal to me and most people, but hey different strokes for different folks.Also it is considered ""photo safe"" I guess that means it won't yellow over time like tape from the 70s does/has."	17

I love having this electronic pencil sharpner at home. It's heavy-duty and pretty awesome. My only complaint and this is minor is that I'd like the largest hole to be larger. I'm sure it's not standard sized but since I have it at home, I'd like to be able to sharpen non-standard sizes as well.Edited to add: I've had this for a while now. Having an electric sharpner in the house when you have a kid who loves to draw is awesome.	17
I'm in the process of moving which is a big enough pain, but boxes are extremely expensive.  This is no expensive.  $20 for a pack of 4 is a little bit above average.  The file boxes themselves are well constructed and easily fit letter files.  I would double tape to make sure that things don't fall along the edges.  They are not super flimsy, but I will not be able to use them again after the move.  I'm definitely expecting some worn edges.	17
If you're looking for a good basic stapler, then this is a great little option.  We're not looking to have a high-end unit with these - just something to keep on the desk for occasional stapling - and this works perfectly for that usage.In other words, I would highly recommend this if you want something for everybody in the office to have a stapler.  If, on the other hand, you're looking for a primary office stapler, you'll probably want to get something nicer.	17
I love Avery labels!  Their free templates are easy to find and download.  The labels print flawlessly every time.  And they are durable.  I really can't say enough about these terrific time savers.  I design my own return address labels with a family portrait on them, I print out address labels for my holiday cards, and I print larger labels for packages, all with ease!  If you are looking for high quality labels that won't let you down, Avery is the way to go...	17
Avery Easy Peel 1 x 2 5/8 Clear label gives any envelope a professional look.  It is of the standard address size, but can be used to label items such as dvds, boxes, etc.  I prefer the clear labels to others, as they give a neat effect on birthday card envelopes.  I actually use the clear shipping ones for this purpose.  My word processsor, which is Word Perfect, includes a template for this label. Avery makes quality labels, and you can't go wrong with these.	17
I bought this on Amazon because of the price for my replacement land line.  it is a good phone and it has a good sound to it.  it is not tinny in my ear as some phones are.  Let's face it, it's only a matter of time until the land line phone is history along with the phone book so I wasn't spending a lot of money on it.  The ringer is nice and not annoying as some are.  I am happy with my purchase.	17
This is a basic stand for a monitor.  It's just a curved metal tube with a metal plate affixed to the top.  The first one I got was defectively assembled -- the metal plate on top was crooked, badly out of square.  I returned it, and the replacement is much better.The color is a sort of metallic black.  There is a gray Allsop logo painted on in raised letters on the front right part of the tube.It gets the job done and looks decent enough.	17
Bigger than the standard box of this class, these 12 x 25 boxes give plenty of room for extra files, paperwork, magazines, etc. I'm clearing all the papers out of my office but obviously can't toss them, and these are the perfect storage solution.Extra well built and reinforced, the string closure works great and avoids messy tape. There's an extra piece of cardboard in the bottom to provide extra strength as well, which is nice.Finally, the lift easy and stack perfectly. My new go-to box.	17
I didn't realize when I ordered this that it's actually intended to survive heating for baked-paint applications?  Anyway it's great for regular tape purposes but pretty pricey as others have observed.  It's got all the properties of masking tape but is thicker than normal and thus less subject to breaking when peeling off.  It has no special holding-on properties, so if you want something with tape strength between a masking tape and duct tape with the stickiness of masking, this is the one for you!	17
I like Avery poducts.  These are no exception.  High quality and perform as expected.  It should be obvious from the size, but these are not the biggest labels.  If you are going to be printing out a lot of labels in bigger font, like say for wedding invitations, then I would choose a bigger label.  I'm not comfortable with inkjet generated labels since they are susceptible to water dissolving the ink... for important letters, I like to stick with laser printed ones (or use ballpoint pen).	17
I just love Prismacolor.  They provide a rich laydown of color and vibrancy that you just do not get from any other artist's pencil.  I just missed having any options in the gray range, so I purchased the next set up and between the two sets, I am thrilled.  I use the pencils up quickly, so having two sets is not a waste at all.  Very highly recommended if you do not want to have a range of gray in your collection.  It has everything else.	17
Manilla folders. Nicely colored. Well cut. They'll blend in well with the crowd.But look closely, and you'll see the tabs are reinforced. Tabs do tend to bend on folders you carry around or shuffle a lot, and the reinforcement will inhibit bending. So it's really a question of how much bent tabs get your back up. If you're crease intolerant these folders may get you endorphins flowing. If you don't even notice the creases you might as well stick with the folders you are currently using.	17
"I received these labels from the Amazon Vine Program, and was eager to give them a try.  I've used Avery products for many years and love that they have use common templates for printing at home.These labels are great for addressing envelopes or boxes you've previously used.  The ""TrueBlock"" technology means that there's no show-through of the previous address.  They stick securely and look professional on the front of even a used envelope.  I'll look for more of these when they're gone.  Thanks, Avery, and thanks Amazon!"	17
Great card stock, excellent paper and it worked great with my inkjet printer.  I chose cute Christmas card design, my photo and my personal message and was done in minutes!  But... I didn't like starting with just blank cards.  For advanced users I'm sure it's what everybody wants, blank slate so their imagination runs wild.  But I wanted to at least start with some color and pre-printed borders, so all I would need to pick is my pictures and write my message.  Overall, still 5 out of 5.	17
As noted in one of the reviews.  The software is in great, but the fact it is powered by USB is one less chord to worry about.  I recommend it to anyone interested in a cheap portable scanner.  You'll fall in love with it.  Again, don't expect too much and we pleasantly surprised.One thing I love the auto crop feature when I scan a photo it crops it in the final image.  Instead of having a big white area where there was no photograph.  It is cool.Peace out	17
Overall, I believe this copy holder to be a good product.Pros*Good looking (although it will most likely be hidden behind copy or a book*Holds books flat (due to elastic band, and bottom lip)*wide enough for to hold two 8 1/2 x 11's*very sturdy (due to the heavy base)Cons*Seems the clear plastic could break (also due to the heavy base)*adjusting the angle is not as easy/accurate as it should beAlso of note: this won't work well as a cookbook holder because there is no splash guard for the books	17
These are not exactly like one gets when business cards are printed professionally, but they are good to use for personal cards or if you are a start-up business. I admit due to my printer I wasted a couple of sheets which was not Avery's card's error. I would get these again for on hand use when I an waiting for a delayed re-order or just want a few fun business cards for special purposes. For the combined price and quality, I think this is a nice deal.	17
I really like this paper, as it is excellent for math and other graphing.  The printed lines on it are perfectly lined up, and the ink is the same darkness on every page, every side.  In short, no QA issues.The reinforcements are excellent and there are no mispunched or unpunched holes.All in all, this is very high quality paper.That said, it is fairly expensive so I wouldn't use it for writing/crumbling up/throwing out type work.If you need a well-made graph-ruled paper with reinforcements, this is an excellent choice.	17
This is a pack of standard, wide ruled writing paper that is 3 hole punched.  There are 200 pages per package.  We've had no problems writing on this paper and putting it into a 3 ring binder.The pages themselves are well made, but might be a bit thinner than other standard papers.  We have not experienced any problems with the paper yet, and we are a family of 2 adults, a 4 year old learning to draw and write basic letters, and a 7 year old doing basic sentences.	17
it is expensive, cost about 50%-100% more than a no name.But is worth it if you need something really good. Printing has not jammed so far. Stickers have not fall yet.My previous one jams for wvery 20 or so pages. Also fall from plastic bags after a few days (I might be not comparing apples to apples, as the previous labels has a smaller size. I have to use the labes between two plastic bags and let the outer places a little pressure on them.Applying on papers, no difference.	17
The price as an add on item is reasonable, and pretty much in line with most retail stores.The quality of the Five Star brand HAS lessened since the late 90s to mid 2000s, but the price has reduced as well.  The cover is nice quality, the paper decent enough.  I have one from a few years ago and the paper is not yellowing.  I wonder if that has to do with humidity?  Unsure.One subject, college ruled, 3 hole punched, pockets for additional papers, and very high quality perforated pages.	17
Well, I do and I love this quadrille paper.  Each side is a different size, so my elder homeschooler uses the 1/4&#34; scale for drawing charts, and my younger homeschooler uses the reverse side to help her keep her math assignments neat until she begins aligning numbers automatically.And, well, I guess I have to confess to using a few sheets myself for drawing a house plan or two or even just making a cool design.All kidding aside, this paper is worth the cost.  I love the reinforced edging too!	17
I have always hated how masking tape didn't stick well to anything other than a flat cardboard box. This tape seems to stick to things very well. The high performance part of this masking tape seems to be true! I have not been able to use it during the &#34;medium baking&#34; process it seems to be designed for, so I can't comment on that part. But the construction is good, it tears relatively easy in the hand, and seems to stick well. Overall, it performs well for masking tape.	17
We've used this for two years with our shredder, and the machine still shreds just fine, so I guess it works as advertised.  The only drawback is that it is a little messier than the lubricated sheets used for the same purpose.Other than the cleanliness of the sheets (1.33/sheet, a new one to be used every time the basket is emptied), I don';t think they're as cost effective as the oil.  It's cheap, it'as easy and it stares at me from my shelf so I won't forget to use it.	17
I usually use the same brand and model, but the yellow highlighter.  I wanted to get this green one so I can differentiate between main ideas/categories and sub-ideas in my textbook, unfortunately, my pen scanner gives me errors with the green highlights.  Doesn't matter if I underline with it, or highlight the line completely with it.  I believe it is too dark of a green which causes these errors.  Thankfully, it only affected 1 chapter in which I tried it with.  I guess I'll have to try a lighter color.	17
Does a roll of tape truly need a review? I guess so. What to say... It's tape. It sticks. It's a good value for the money. It peels easily and comes off pretty easily. We use it for packing and crafts around the house. Large rolls like this do well with a large heavy duty dispenser. You might want to consider getting one of the those too. Not the gun kind but the kind that sit on a desk. 3M generally makes great products and this is no exception. Enjoy.	17
I've ordered several of these Mead Spiral notebooks from Amazon. They are affordable and always ship quickly, arriving in pristine condition. Colors are variable. Nothing out of the ordinary here, just a notebook you could buy at a store, but it's nice to have it delivered without paying more rather than having to buy it at the store. Another advantage is that you can have them shipped in bulk. I tend to go through a lot of notebooks and I've been pleased with the service ordering through Amazon. I recommend it.	17
I've been using Avery labels for years, primarily to make my own return address labels and as someone that sends out a lot of SASE, it saves a lot of time. Avery's Easy Peel makes their address labels that much easier to use. I use Microsoft Word to print labels. Word has templates for labels, so once you find 8660, enter your text and hit print. The clear address label does go on completely clear, which would especially be useful when using high quality paper, such as sending out wedding invitations.	17
Scotch Giftwrap Tape may not be new, but if you've never tried it, now's the time! It is made with a special satin or semi-gloss finish that makes the tape virtually invisible on most giftwrap paper. Try it on a package and you'll be surprised at how it disappears. Scrapbookers might want to experiment with this tape as well. With all of the holiday gift wrapping near, you really need to get some of this tape - you will be rewarded with praise for your professional looking packages. Very highly recommended!	17
This is easily the best gift wrapping tape I have ever used. It is transparent, of course, but not shiny, like some competing brands I have used. UnlikeScotch Magic(TM) Tape 810-3PK, 3/4-inch x 1296 Inches, 3-Pack(which is also fantastic), this tape doesn't look cloudy on top of wrapping paper; it really is just hard to see. The adhesive is strong enough to hold gift wrap together, but is also forgiving enough to allow you to peel it off and readjust if need to. All in all, this is a great product.	17
First of all, I LOVE this product. It is well-consructed. It uses quality material. It is a great size for most books, and it just looks beautifully professional on my desk.It tils back easily so you can read at a couple of angles. However, as useful as the ledge on the bottom is for stopping the book from slipping off, it also makes page turning difficult because it cannot be removed nor is it mobile.The base/legs cannot be set in a perfectly straight angle, but that's probably just me being anal.	17
if you look at other reviews, someone once mentioned that you have to let them sit for a while. I let them sit for about six hours before using them otherwise for some reason they don't want to release from the backer, it's strange, but that's what I've found. I just purchased my last batch of these labels. As soon as they run out I will be using a printer that will print directly onto the discs, much simpler and better too. It all depends on how many discs you make.	17
I used these books in high school and college. I also assign them to my students. If you don't manhandle them, Mead composition books are the best cheap notebook (if you're not going digital) that you will find anywhere, lying flat and not easily tearing or unraveling with wear like a spiral notebook. Sometimes they wear down swiftly, with the cover falling off, but only if you don't treat them carelessly. They come in wide-ruled and college-ruled varities. They are great for academic work or personal journal writing. I recommend them!	17
Someone in my office must love these pens more than me as I have had 3 disapper from my desk this year alone.  I have a big hand and this this pen fits perfectly with my grip.  It is soft and unlike my cheap free pens I get from work I don't develop any callouses on my fingers.  It writes smooth and I never get any smudges the first time i put the ink to paper.  I buy several at a time because they are the only pen I will use.	17
I needed a sharpener at home for my kids and the various sizes of pencils they use.  This thing is good in theory, but poor in practice.  Every single pencil that is sharpened in this machine comes out with one side sharpened, one side pointed wood.  A big disappointment.  I paid more for mine than here on Amazon.I also tried battery operated kind made by the same company...not enough power.  Now I am looking at the grand daddy of pencil sharpeners...electric! I think I will skip the X acto brand though.	17
My son's school requires mechanical pencils and he was extremely frustrated with the constantly-breaking lead of other brands. It was really a time waste and made math lessons frustrating. These pencils were a revelation; the lead rarely if ever breaks, and they feel more like an ordinary pencil in your hand than some of the super-thin mechanical pencils out there. Now these are the only ones he will use. They are available locally but how convenient to get them as an &#34;add-on&#34; item top an Amazon order with no extra shipping!	17
This is a very useful product.  It holds items such as books, papers, and it can even be used as an art easel!  The leg arrangement makes it a bit bulky and awkward to move around--but it is also the unique leg arrangement that allows it to be adjusted in so many ways and the weight of the legs is what keeps it sturdy.  I like the clear plastic backing which actually creates a very clean, contemporary, and lightweight appearance.Bottomline:  Great item if you don't need to move it around a lot!	17
"Even with the advent of tablets for data presentations, hard copies of reports and documents are sometimes still necessary.  These are basic 8 1/2 x 11"" insertable tab dividers that provide easy organizing, sorting, and indexing of printed materials.  I like the capability of printing out the insertable mini tab sheets for a more professional and neat appearance.  Comes pre-punched for three ring binders, and the holes have plastic tape reinforcements.  After almost two months of routine use, these tab dividers are holding up alright.  Long term durability remains to be seen."	17
I have used Dr Grip mechanical pencils and ball point pens for as long as I can remember. They always work well, and they smoothly flow over whatever paper I am using. It took me a while to get used to the gel pens. I don't know why. But now I have almost stopped using the ball point pens. The only issue is the gel cartridges to tend to dry up at the point when there is a lot of ink left. I think just using them more will solve that problem.	17
Some of us have products that we've had for years, whether it be a book or album, that we either can't or would prefer not to update to a newer format. For me, I have a few old paperbacks that are no longer in print and several vinyl albums. After a number of years, some of these things can start to come apart. This Scotch book tape addresses that need. I think this is a very good idea for those with large book or record collections and allows preserving the old favorites.	17
Clear fiber tape lays down a strong bond. Scotch Filament Tape 893 was introduced in our Santa's Workshop last month. It's great for closing bulging packages and holding a firm grip with just a few inches of tape. It reminds me of the industrial tape inside your computer that keeps ribbons and wires in place. A little of this filament tape seems to hold very well in place. I imagine it might be useful for tool repair, and fix-it applications as well, when duct tape doesn't have enough strength. Looks better too!	17
The only reason I bought this product is because of the bottle.  I could not find a bottle with a long nozzle in my area.  I'll be refilling the bottle with cheap vegetable oil.  I couldn't even find this product in local office supply stores.  The only thing I could find was a pack of ten sheets of paper impregnated with soybean oil for $9.99.  I left the store in a huff that somebody would even think of charging that kind of money for soybean oil. There is simply no need for it.	17
The velcro on the flap is either too strong or the flap on top is too weak.  After one use the flap is already creased and nearly ripped.The internal files work well and are very sturdy. The base of the file is also sturdy and it's nice that it stands up.If you will be opening and closing the file a lot I can't recommend it because the top flap is too flimsy. But if you will be filing once and then putting away for only occasional reference it is a very solid choice.	17
I write my appointments in my appointment book, in pencil.  I also write my checkbook balance in pencil.  Anything that is subject to change....pencil.  The eraser on the end makes it easy to change an appointment or recalculate a balance in the checkbook without asking around, &#34;Does anyone have an eraser?&#34;  The flow of the pencil is also nice.  It's a very soft, easy flow when writing and the lead does not easily break off, despite dropping of the pencil.  I buy this brand and style pencil over and over again.  Completely satisfied.	17
"I have used the Sanford highlighters for close to 20 years.  there are nice.  However, just yesterday I got some from a local store and it is now called ""Shapie by Sanford"".  They are almost a disaster when highlighting textbooks.  The wide brush is too wide.  The side (the narrower brush) is really thin.  So, I cannot highlight any books or textbooks and had to return them.I guess the new ones could be good for highlighting invoices or business computer printouts, but they may lose some customers who would like to highlight books."	17
I read all these reviews, and since I've been using these white out things a lot recently for note taking, I figured I'd get this.  I'd been using the BIC version of this since that was in my grocery store.  Anyway, got this for the reviews here, was excited to try it for how positive people were.  It doesn't roll on as easily as the BIC, it makes a scraping feeling that's like the chalkboard effect (strangely uncomfortable, don't know what it is), and it rubs off too easily.  Go with the BIC.	17
"This stuff works really well.  I only put on things that I plan on leaving up for a long time/permanently - so unfortunately, I can't comment on stuff left up for longer than 6 months since I just got it ( maybe update later).  For temporary items, I use the temporary ""command"" strips from 3M which allows me to peel stuff off walls without damage.  This product is supposed to be permanent, so there is no guarantee it won't damage your walls.  I use it to hold a metal towel hook to wood drawer."	17
"I love these clear labels- Avery is always top-notch. Printing on them is easy- Avery's site provides four ways that you can design and print the labels. I used the ""Avery Design and Print Online""- no downloads required. You can also download the templates to use in Word or on other programs. Anyway, Avery online has lots of designs and it's simple to use, so all I had to do was type in my address and print the labels. They dry right away and the print did not smear at all. Highly recommended product!"	17
Good for making your own business cards for a pretty reasonable price. Whether your starting your own business or just want to show off to your friends it's a pretty decent product. The cards are a little thinner than normal but that's probably so that it fits and feeds through your printer properly. They are very easy to use and can be done by using no software. Avery has provided a website for uploading images or choosing from pre-made templates. Overall it's a nice product and you get a decent amount for the price.	17
I'm not going to go into detail about the lead or writing quality of these pencils -- they do the job fine for me. But I don't notice a huge difference with others, though I don't use pencils a lot. Just to write music. However, I'm sold on the comfort of these. The barrel is the right size, is round so no edges, and is very easy to write with. I'd strongly recommend these for those writing music, doing math problems, even some basic drafting. Also they'd be good for exams requiring a pencil.	17
These file folders are colorful and well designed.  They have folding metal fasteners on both sides and they have organizing tabs on them (top, center, bottom).  They come in three colors.  All in all, these are really nice, except for one thing: the card stock is light weight. The tab-edge is reinforced (2-ply), so you can use it reliably.I plan on using these for organizing data and some reports.  If you plan on using these, you WILL need a two-hole punch, or some means of consistently punching holes in the tops of the papers.	17
I have the goal of getting all papers and receipts organized before the new year. It's so frustrating to need some document and having to browse piles of papers before finding it, hence I finally took the time to place everything where it belongs. These folders having two fasteners per folder allow to organize a couple of different issues within each folder. For example, there are great to keep children's school and doctor appointment related papers. The different colors can be used to track individual family members documents as well. I highly recommend it.	17
This is everything you would need if you are not planning to do a whole lot of writing.  It is very basic and exactly what I needed as I did not need a lot of colors or a large set.  It has the spray for cleaning the board and the eraser for erasing the writings.  The only problem is that odor ink in the pens is very strong and should have bought the lower odor type.  Other than that this is perfect for home use and for what I will be using it for.	17
Nice useful calculator. Not as nice as the Casio SL-300 Wallet Style Pocket Calculator, which I really like, it is great just the same. It has a hard case that protects the calculator from regular use or putting in one's pocket or briefcase. It goes off when you close the case. It is a good size to use on the go or on your desk. Looking for a handy durable calculator, I think this will fit the tbill. More so, the Casio SL-300 Wallet Style Pocket Calculator will be even better. See my other review.	17
I use this for regular notebook paper in the three ring binder I haul to meetings and similar.  The reinforced edges mean the pages don't rip out and fall all over the place, which is awesome!  I also really like the graph ruling - works the same as lined notebook paper and also helps me subdivide pages if I'm taking notes on multiple topics.The lines aren't so dark they're distracting.  I pretty well always have a stock of this paper on hand - even when I'm not getting it from Amazon for a review ;)	17
I have an HP 48GX that has been kicking for more than twenty years and an HP 11 that is more than 25 years old and still flawless.  I have had this 12C for about 18 months and the number 5 key is already giving me trouble (have to press hard for it to register).  No drops, no abuse.  The overall feel of this new HP is cheaper plastic.  The keys feel hollow and light.  The available functions are great.  This is a classic calculator.  But the functions are no good if the keys stop working...	17
"I use a lot of 5"" x 8"" notepads. I keep one on my computer table at home for taking notes, doodling, whatever, and I go through 2-3 pads a month. The TOPS pads are as good or better than the pads I used to buy at office supply stores. The nearest office supply store is several miles from home, and it's easier and more economical to buy the TOPS pads from Amazon with free Prime shipping.Update (November 2, 2012): I've just received my third order of these pads, and I'm still very pleased with them."	17
These are the best highlighterst that I have bought.  I used to buy the Bic ones all the time.  These were on clearance when school was getting ready to start and I was a little strapped for cash.  They last much longer than other highlighters I've tried (Bic, Avery, some cheap dollar store kind).I tend to color code my textbooks.  For me, it makes studying much easier and I have found that I remember more if I use different colors.I would like to mention that I got jipped.  My pack of highlighters didn't have turquoise.  :c)	17
How often do checklists, memos and receipts get buried in a fat file?  Do you maintain client or student files with mandatory required documents?  Can you tell at a glance what's contained in a file without pawing through it? It those questions started you thinking, these folders are for you.  They're wonderful, and make it possible to attach a table of contents or checklist to the front cover, making the contents quickly accessible.  The colors are bright and actually pretty, and the folders are sturdy enough without being bulky.Once again, Smead provides an invaluable paper product.	17
I have always used Scotch masking tape for previous paint jobs in my home as I have less problems and better performance than any other paint related tape. I like clean, sharp corners and find that this the Scotch Brand helps this happen effortlessly. I also love a nice clean, smooth pull away without leaving any residue or feathering. It works well with school projects and just about anything else around the house. The uses are endless. I will generally spend a few bucks more for the Scotch brand as it performs best for my needs.	17
"I used this tape, which has more of a sheen than regular ""invisible"" tape, on several different kinds of gift wrap. It definitely blends better with papers with a slight gloss to them since it has a similar texture. On matte-surfaced papers like tissue wrap, craft paper, and ""natural"" papers, the slight sheen of the tape makes it show up more. For those who like their wrappings to be really fancy, this tape is a nice addition to wrapping supplies. It would also work well on any project with paper that has a slight gloss to it."	17
I really liked this product for several reasons. These are great to print your normal business card on one side. Then if you are doing a limited time promotion, you can advertise the details of that on the back of the card (with an expiration date). Plus, I like that I can use them to help me try out different designs for my card and then when I get it the way I really want, I can have a large number printed professionally. It's not really cost effective to print several thousand cards using these.Very handy product!	17
Return address labels save you time, and the Avery system is easier-to-use than many.These labels perform exactly as described. They feed perfectly, are perfectly spaced on the label sheet, are easy to peel and position, and they can be repositioned many times yet still stick firmly.For those not familiar with how easy these Avery labels work:You simply open a Word DocumentClick on Envelopes and LabelsSelect Avery Label 5267Type in what you want on the labeland Print.The label sheet even shows you which end to insert in your printer.In a couple of seconds you have great-looking return address labels.	17
"I have had negative experiences with ""generic"" printable labels in the past...specifically, with the sheet getting stuck in my ink jet printer.  I have had no problems at all with these Avery labels. They go through the printer smoothly. The labels are easy to peel off the sheet as well.  I have also used these same labels in the white version, which work equally well.  However, for purely aesthetic reasons, I prefer the clear labels.If you go online to the Avery website, there is a free software download that allows you to customize the labels to your liking."	17
I have used this on tile, metal, glass and interior walls and all surfaces are compatible with this mounting tape in my experience.  I did notice that if the surface is ice cold, make sure you warm the area up with a hairdryer if possible for a better stick.  To remove, I slid a razor through the foam core and used Goo Gone to remove the rest of the square, worked great!  I was able to hang a wipe board near my front door than I had been meaning to mount for months, this stuff gets the job done!	17
The main reason I like these labels:  1.  Easy to use with my software programs.  2.  Print out perfect!  3.  Was able to put a clip art on them.  4.  Last reason but the best of all.  They peel off so very easy. I have to add that the Avery Labels have found so many uses from address labels,for file folders,  recipe headings, journaling, labeling totes and I'm sure I will find other places to use them.  I haven't found anything negative about these labels and usually I don't like using them because they are hard to peel off.	17
If you're fed up with half-wits pestering you at home in the evening, this device is a godsend. I had been receiving an average of three calls each evening, which I tried to deal with by turning down the answering machine. But I still heard the 'beep' each time a call was received. Worse yet, some of the callers felt the need to leave a message.The TeleZapper cuts off these calls before they even get to your answering machine, or to you. There are competing products that cost less, but this one is the most effective that I've found.	17
I guess I remember what these packs of paper were like when I was in school (which was some years ago now).  I remember them being thicker than this, but it's not like the product I got was too thin.  I saw another review saying you can't write on both sides of the paper with ink.  I wouldn't go quite that far, but it is a bit &#34;thinnish&#34;.Still, having said that it is what it is.  A pack of paper that you can put in your binder and write stuff on.  It's fine.  Makes great paper airplanes, too.  :)	17
Texas Instruments Solar Calculater. This is a neat calculator and soent take up a ton of space on your desk. The numbers are large enough to see. And has never given me a false answer or calculation like other ones I have had.It has a solart cell so you do not have to be concerned with battery failure.  As your desl lamp or outside window light will keep it charged for you. Large led numbers are easy to read if your eye sight is not what it used to be.Purchased here on Amazon.com Where the whole World. Shops for Value.	17
These are general use return address/locate labels. 2 inch by 4 inches.  I checked MS word and MS works and Avery provided the Avery template numbers, so they worked well with all my applications without the need for me to download the templates from the the Avery website. And, of course, Avery was the industry leader in labels from the beginning, so you can not loose buying these.  And the TrueBlock really works.  I took one of the blank labels and pasted it on the dark blue folder the lables come in.  No blue shows through, it is pure white..	17
Item arrived quickly, in excellent condition, and are sooo helpful if you scrapbook as much as I do. Some photos need to be covered first before going into the ol' scrapbook and some of my scrapbook covers need to be covered well too and these are the most effective for performing these tasks. Lie half of the adhesive-exposed down first, unback the other half of the covered backing second and let it fall on what you want covered...this system always works best to avoid air bubbles and puckers from forming. Smooth to suit and you'll be good to go. Recommended.	17
Nice looking notebook that has 100 sheets and it is wide ruled. It can be used for any purpose, business or student, for a school or as a personal organizer.Its covers are made of firm cardboard, pages are bound together with firm string and unlike spiral notebooks its pages cannot be torn out. I use it to write down notes on my work and for that purpose they are just great. Additionally, this deal where for 5$ you get five of them is a bargain price.Overall, this is a good and handy notebook that can be recommended for most people.	17
Although my ordering of this product was totally accidental I decided to keep it since it is such a wonderful product.  I just will not run out of tape for quite a while.  I would highly recommend this product and remember the most expensive label makers are not necessarily the best.2-16-2012I did not open this product right away but when I did I found the incorrect item had been sent not just by one company but two; neither of which are Amazon.com.  I have actually stopped doing business with one company because they would not allow me to return the item.	17
What can one say about these pens? They're about the most basic pens imaginable. They have a plain, cylindrical body, a thoroughly unsophisticated plastic cap, and the whole assembly is the same color as the ink contained within. They won't win any beauty contests, but they do put ink on paper, and they do it cheaply. Isn't that what really counts at the end of the day?One minor complaint I have about these pens is that the caps tend to crack if you put them on tightly. Other than that, these are perfectly adequate and the price really can't be beat.	17
I got this looking for a simple copy holder...I was easily deceived by the picture thinking it would be much less than it is!  It has a large footprint and it's got a significant weight to it...it really will hold up to 300 sheets!  I do find that for some reason, the little elastic cord that runs across it to hold your paper against the back seems to pop off when not in use, so if you move it around frequently to make room for other things (as I mentioned, it's rather large), you run the risk of losing that cord.	17
This oil comes in a plastic container with a nozzle that makes it easy to lubricate the shredder. Yes, it is outrageously priced but it does the job it supposed to do. I just don't believe a product should be given a poor rating because of the price. I do believe that price is a factor in the purchase decision but not in the product itself. But, that's just my opinion. When I run out of the Fellowes lubricant I will refill the container with vegetable oil because of the price but not because of the quality of the Fellowes oil.	17
0.7 mm is the most conferrable tip size, anything bigger are for kids.Quite simply the best disposable pen out there.  For the price and quality, the Uni-ball Vision pen line is the best out there.  The ink is light-year smoother then normal dry ink pen.  The pen looks good and has no fancy parts to it.  You can jaunt down very fast notes since the ink flow very rapid.  You can see how much ink you have through a clear spot in the middle.The more expensive Gel is the only ink that is smoother and has less blending then the Vision.	17
I am a college student.  I am in classes for at least an hour non stop at times for lectures.  My longest class was 4 hours.  Typical cheap disposable pens made my hands crampy in about 5-10 minutes.  I can go all class period and longer with out any pain.  Ink is nice and smooth, doesn't smear as much as cheaper gel pens, and I can find refills at every store I been to that sells pens or here for a reasonable price.  With heavy use (4-6 hours min 5 days a week), 1 ink refill lasts me about a month.	17
Although I wish the lead lasted longer, I still buy these because they write well and are dependable. Other mechanical pencils that you push the top to advance the lead don't allow you to decide how much lead you want exposed. As a result, sometimes you push the top of the pencil and the lead exposed is slightly too long so that when you go to write the lead just breaks off. Drives me nuts! With these pencils you can decide how long or short you want the lead. I've never had to deal with the lead tip breaking off, ever!	17
The only pens I like to write with are PAPER MATE FLAIRS.  I usually prefer the black ones, but bought a box of blue to supplement my stash of black & I like them very much.  Great value pen and I love the paper-to-pen feel of these as I write.  Habit, I guess : )Just remember this is water-soluble ink.  If you write your heart out and then get caught out in a rainstorm, you are utterly and completely DOOMED.Great value; like being able to buy them by the dozen; thanks again, Amazon, for expanding our procurement options; highly recommended value!	17
I usually use Hallmark's greeting card paper and like it a lot.  Avery's product is equally good.  It is a true matte finish, so if you want a little more shine, this isn't for you.  The stock is thick enough that the printing doesn't show through and the fold is neat and professional.  No need to buy pre made cards if you have these on hand.  I use American Greeting's printable option a lot but my kids like to make their own cards with it.  They look much better than trying to fold your own card stock.  I would highly recommend these.	17
I bought a whole case of these Mead spiral notebooks for my kids.  The pages are thin, they aren't perforated, but the price was right (back to school sales) and I'm not expecting much for school notebooks.  My biggest qualm is the wire spiral eventually getting tangled around the holes on the left edge.  It's not neat and pretty after a while and the covers don't sit well then.  They do start out looking nice and I'm not really complaining.The pages are wide-ruled, good for elementary school kids.  Both of my kids use them and they don't have any issues with them.	17
This has to be the best chicken rack out there.  It's easy to use, easy to clean, and pretty to boot.  I gave this to my husband with the cookbook, **Beer-Can Chicken: And 74 Other Offbeat Recipes for the Grill** (http://www.amazon.com/Beer-Can-Chicken-Other-Offbeat-Recipes/dp/0761120165/ref=pd_bxgy_ol_img_b/105-3317259-8297264) and it's been terrific recipe after terrific recipe ever since.  You CANNOT make chicken this good in the kitchen--it's better than any rotisserie, better than any baked chicken --ever--.  You've got to try this--you won't be sorry!	18
"I got this saw after an ice-storm in Tulsa caused serious damage to a dozen trees.  It had no problem cutting through a 16"" oak trunk.It's a workhorse that performs well. It tends to drink oil, but I guess that's good for performance and chain life.There's a gizmo that's a screwdriver/wrench for chain removal.  I lost mine because THERE'S NOWHERE ON THE SAW HOUSING TO STASH IT (are you listening Poulan).  Otherwise, chain adjustment and removal are pretty straightforward."	18
I am guessing the 'attractant' used in these traps is derived from poop.WORD TO THE SQUEAMISH- this bag will be FULL OF FLIES, and the whole thing will be pulsing from the dying wing-beats of the hundreds (thousands?) of flies inside the bag. It is NOT for the faint of heart.YUCK. It's giving me the shivers just to look at the picture.Flies are gross, a clear bag full of horse poop smell and dying/dead flies is worse!Find a different solution.	18
We spray our vegetables with deer repellent.  Effective but expensive and washes off.We tried motion detection lights.  Worked for a weekWe tried motion detection sprinklers.  Worked but overwatered the garden.We have a five foot high electric fence around our garden.  The deer jump it.We tried the Havahart 5250 Electronic Deer Repellent.  Worked for a small area but we have a 1/4 acre garden.  We'd need hundreds of dollars worth of these things and the deer could still jump over them.	18
If you need an edger, and don't want the trouble of maintaining a gas-powered edger, this is the electric edger for you. It's more powerful than most, and sturdy as all heck. But it's also pretty light, too. Very easy to move around the yard.This tool is as indespensible as my lawn mower. If you're edging your lawn with a string trimmer, or not edging your lawn at all, you'll love the results you can get so easily with this edger.	18
No more dragging 200 feet of extension cord out when it's time to do some yard trimming. This thing is light weight, strong enough for moderate trimming, and no gas or cords to deal with. It's much like a cordless screwdriver or drill, use it, plug it back in...use it again. It's the ease of it all that makes it a winner. If you plan on taking down HEAVY brush etc...go for the cord, but for maintenance around the yard...this is it!	18
"I had trouble getting this to spray. Some of the other reviews offer useful tips on this problem.The active ingredients are similar to certain related products: ""Contains putrescent eggs solids (4.63%), garlic (.001%) and capsaicin (.001%)."" My experience with these is that they work well for up to a couple of weeks, although they need to be reapplied after a rain, or even after heavy sprinkler use. A downside of this formula is that the smell of garlic will permeate the garden."	18
We have a variety of animals in our neighborhood including deer, squirrels, rabbits, birds, etc.  And, that doesn't count the pet varieties.  We wanted a way to keep the animals, especially the deer, away from our plants.  They come off a park behind the houses across the street from us, go through our yard, and then scatter through the neighborhood.  This product did okay, but it washes away with the rain (which occurs quite a bit) and it needs to be reapplied.	18
I have one outside on my deck and a second one in my garage.  They have each held up very nicely.  If you assemble them correctly (and trust me it's easy to NOT do it correctly) they are very solid.  The problem some are having is they are failing to assemble them correctly and sadly the design allows that to mistakenly happen.  Rubbermaid needs to do something to address this.  When it's put together wrong you'll definitely get people saying they don't hold up.	18
hello,in addition to our new gilmour 1/2 inch hose, we purchased a gilmour 2 way connector.  the brass fittings shut off the water without any dribbles or leaks.  it is a little hard to twist, but it shuts off the water and redirects it to the correct hose fitting.  again, this is another gilmour quality product and everything should last for years.  just be patient with the hard twist in the valves.  it shuts it off much better than the  products at the local stores.	18
I wish I'd ordered the 75-foot version since 25' isn't long enough! The cardboard label also says NOT APPROVED FOR SALE IN CALIFORNIA or something like that. So maybe the Hose Police will come and get me and drag me away. It's surprisingly lightweight and seems very flexible, then again it's brand new, and the 10-year old hoses this is replacing were supple, once, too. I can see ordering a second 25' length, since 25' is actually not enough to reach anywhere in my tiny yard.	18
This fire pit is very well constructed, & should hold up for quite a while.  It's a great addition to any outdoor gathering!  Assembly is easy, even for the most mechanically challenged.  I am concerned, as a few others here have noted, that the legs & lid may rust, so I'd recommend covering it, &/or putting in a shed/garage when not in use to prolong the life of this product.Overall, this is a great product that should add enjoyment to any backyard, or camping trip.  Recommended!	18
Said to be drinking safe, this cute little 4 ft hose is perfect for me as a split-off from the main faucet where I have the big hose. On a hot day I like to drink the really cold well water which comes out after garden-watering. The connections are tight. I always put a bit of Vaseline on washers at the beginning of the season, OR replace them with new rubber ones. I do this on sprayers as well. Maybe that's why I had no leakage problems.	18
Got tired of buying all those little cans for 3+ bucks each, so got this to hookup the 20lb tank I got from Lowe's to my newCuisinart CGG-200 All-Foods 12,000-BTU Portable Outdoor Tabletop Propane Gas Grill.  Works great.  No problems at all.So when grilling at home, we'll be using this.  For camping or tailgating or anything, we'll go with the little cans.It all seems so obvious...so if you're in the same situation - get this and save money.  It works, and you don't need any extra adapters.	18
"I have an epidemic of chipmunks in my yard, causing no end of problems.  I had a ""Havahart 1025 Two-Door Cage Trap"" which works great, but wanted a couple more traps to cut down the population.  I've used the two side-by-side, and can tell you, that chipmunks prefer the 1025 by at least 5-1.  They like the 1025 so much, I've left it out overnight without bait, and found a chippie inside in the morning.The 0745 is nice, but if you're trapping chippies, get the 1025 instead."	18
As a veteran of numerous hummingbird feeder, they tend to have several universals:  They are hard to fill without spilling, and they are hard to clean turning into bacterial growing grounds.  The Hummzinger 367 solves both of these.  It is exceedingly easy to clean and fill.  The top opens, and snaps back on.  There is a reservoir in the middle to trap any ants that covet the sugary solution, which has eliminated another bane of hummingbird feeder.The most important feature is that the humming birds love it!	18
I would love to review this product, but one of the pieces arrived broken and there's no number or address to ask for a replacement part!  I've informed Amazon, but it's been almost a week and no reply.  So, here's what I can tell you.  The bench looks beautiful.  Nice, dark wood and looks very sturdy when assembled correctly.  But I would never buy another product from this company as there is no way to get a hold of them when a piece is broken or missing!	18
"I almost bought a grill cover when I picked up my new grill.  They even included a 25% off coupon in the owners manual.  Luckily I checked here first, and hit on this model since it was clearly the favorite.  This grill cover is as good as the reviews claim.  Includes side-vents, handles, a zippered pocket...  A very well executed product for something as ""simple"" as a grill cover.  Highly recommended, I'll gladly join in on the 5 star reviews for this cover, well worth the price."	18
We have a similar model One Touch Premium home (Germany) and the quality of Weber pays off. I brought the old chinese bbq to trash today ;-).The Weber is very solid build and comes ready to go with drop pans and charcoal holders (wires). Bought a chimney from Weber since the reviews were so good. Tried direct and indirect, keep on training.Will not to back to chinese quality again.Since we live in Northern Germany usage of this bbq is limited to summer time, completed with a Q200 grill.	18
Yard Butler generally makes good products that I like. This, unfortunately, isn't one of them.I've got a small amount of lawn that gets lots of traffic, so this, if it worked, would make great sense.I tried using this with the lawn at various stages of moistness, in case that was the issue. In each instance the aerator jammed, repeatedly. In some cases, un-jamming the unit was very difficult. It is currently waiting for me to unjam it with a hammer drill and masonry bit.I don't recommend this unit.	18
This little beauty is just what I have been looking for. It pumps up in seconds, smoothly, too. Just a twist of the lid and it releases the pressure. The handle fits my hand and the pivoting spray head lets me get the water on the plants instead of the wall. More pumps = more pressure and bigger spray. Thick plastic, lock on spray button. The little cone helps contain diameter of the spray. I love this thing. Holds just enough water, but, not so much that it's heavy.	18
But it does seem to work. Added it to a mix of green and brown compost, with an approximate ratio of 1:2, and the mix is warm and decomposing. Essentially this is a bunch of microbes and some nutrients to either accelerate, or perhaps jump-start your compost. If the bacteria are already around, as they would be most places, this product isn't strictly necessary, but could help out with the compost. Hard to tell without a real side-by-side comparison. if you're in a rush though, it's likely to help out.	18
Have to say i have not used this yet.But taking itout of te boxi wa like wow frigen awesome! Totally is better than describedand pictured.....Cant wait to use it.Ivehad spider mites and the plants need t be sprayed with killig agents yes purchased thru amazon......And to nevr hav bugsagain i plan on spraying them a couiple times to prevent any invading my crop again.......But when i used acnventinal sprayer gt itall over myself gtting undeneath leaves which is a must......Soooooo i love this prouduct and cat wait to use it!	18
This isn't a well built Deck Box since it's so cheaply made of plastic. On top of that, I had it shipped to the Volga region, which cost me about $[...]. I probably should have invested in something locally made out of wood or bricks, but I hadn't thought of that. The purpose of it was to store old shoes given to me by the local shoemaker, but he went out of business. Now I only use it to store dead rats that I have found on the countryside property.	18
I think this is just too hard to say if it works or not. New moles come and take a prior one's territory so quickly and unless you see them dead, you just don't know...and you won't see them dead using these. I have dug up the tunnel over and over to see if it is still there and haven't seen it taken. So, I have switched to Cinch traps and they work for me because I have so many rock walls and landscaping that can only fit those kind.	18
"Unlike some other reviewers, I find the build quality satisfactory. It is a little small for potted plants, however. When raised to the highest position, the lamp has a 26"" clearance to the ground. The high-efficiency bulb generates a little less heat than standard fluorescent lights but is still hot enough to scorch leaves that come too close. In short, the maximum height for the plants is around 24"", sufficient for a seed starter but way too low to serve as a mini-green house for plants that need to winter indoors."	18
I have about 5 sets of these for each hose at my house as well as my Gilmour foam gun, AR pressure washer, CR Spotless, and a couple of hose nozzles.  The brass is strong, the mechanics are crisp, and the rubber gives excellent impact protection.  The only thing you will be replacing from this equation is the o-rings every year or so, depending on use.  This set will make your life a whole lot easier, and no more struggling in trying to loosen or tighten the hose from the house.	18
We have several acres in walnuts on our property and fight an endless battle with the ground squirrels which are very plentiful in our area. Used aggressively and diligently these gassers work pretty well. There are other ones sold which have less than half as much material in them, and those ones don't work worth a darn.The hard part is making sure the squirrel is home when you do the job. The best way is to gas the hole right after you see a squirrel go in it. Follow the directions.	18
This is a decent, cheap nozzle. It doesn't leak and does not break easily. I bought the yellow so I could spot it in my yard easily. I did break the first one I had, but that was my fault. I was reeling it back in and the handle caught on a rock out of my line of sight. I kept reeling it in anyway, and yanking on the hose until the handle broke. I would say that under normal conditions, and even somewhat rough conditions this nozzle holds up well.	18
When I turn the water on, the nozzle starts spraying water, without me touching it or pushing the handle. Today I wanted to wash my yard, I left the hose with the nozzle on the floor until I turned the water on. By the time I got to the hose, the water coming out from the nozzle soaked my coffee table in the living room through the screen door that was closed. The water on the nozzle is always on until I turn off the water supply. This is totally unacceptable.	18
I like these Fiskar shovels.  This one is really handy for transplanting as you would imagine.  Good for digging any type of deep narrow holes or edging a lawn.  Seems sturdy and good steel.  The handle is a bit plasticky and I hope that it holds up.  I also have the Fiskars 9668 shovel which has all steel handle to the end - no plastic.  That shovel seems a little stouter than this one but is also heavier and for different uses.  This is a winner.  I want more Fiskar shovels.	18
So what did you want to know? I started my trimming carrier with the Black & Decker Automatic Feed Spool (AFS). It is just plug and go. I prefer my trimmer string to come from Black & Decker. This way I will not come unraveled trying to use some cheap substitute. The spools last longer than expected. But all good things come to an end and you don't want to be half way through the yard when you find yourself strung out.Black & Decker CMM1200 19-Inch 24-Volt Cordless Electric Mulching Lawn Mower	18
I used this in Vietnam, where the local butcher, Hang Kau Pung, asked me to use my gas grille for his yak. After butchering it, we used the grille to smoke it and had a problem when the ribs did not fit on the Weber 3601 Rib Rack. I had 5 Weber Rib Racks so they were useless and we had to put the cooked meat on the fly dirty ground near treated sewer water. I suppose if you are using pig Ribs they fit but be weary of larger meat animals.	18

I have had this cover on my grill for over a year now in Minnesota, where it has endured a wide range of harsh weather.  The cover has held up wonderfully.  The only word of caution is on the color.  It is clearly shown in the listing as having green left and right panels.  They may be green when you first buy the cover, but they will quickly turn to brown when you put it on your grill.  To me, this is a minor drawback, but others might find it more objectionable.	18
Cobra's 10-inch adjustable flower pot works well for those who would like a pot that can mount to their deck or patio railing and hold a pot up to 10-inches in diameter at the top (and 7 inches in diameter at the base). The adjustable railing brackets have screw/bolt combinations that will accommodate railing widths between 2 and 6 inches. The pot is simple to adjust, install, and use. It will accommodate plastic, wood, metal, or clay pots as long as the dimensions are correct. The neutral black color works well anywhere.	18
I've had two of these shovels so far because I wear them out.  To make them easier to use, I drill the rivets holding the metal blade on so that I can remove the blade all together.  Plastic on concrete or brick is MUCH easier to push, and slide and it doesn't grab, which IMO causes more muscle strain than anything.  Sure, they wear out faster, but I still get 5-6 good seasons out of them.If you have issues pushing it, do as I stated above.  It makes a good shovel great!	18
This feeder works well for the birds as you can attract all typed by putting the sweet cakes and the seed into it.  The downside is squirrels will have access to this unless you hang it on a pole and put a round shield underneath to keep them out but if you do this, you should have no issues with squirrels getting in.  The wood fades it color a little as well in the weather, so I would suggest putting some wood protecting stain/sealer to keep it looking nice all year round.	18
When you open up the cap you can smell the hot pepper from several feet away.  It's about the same consistency as salad dressing.  Be sure to dilute it enough if you're using a sprayer.  I only diluted it 50% because I wanted it to be super strong and it was still too thick, it kept clogging the nozzle.  Note that if you have a problem with cats using the vegetable garden as a kitty litter box, this product doesn't seem to work on cats; just other critters like rabbits and squirrels.	18
"I love the spray-tip applicator -- they call it a ""puffer"" -- excellent way to direct the diatomaceous earth. Diatoms are a type of algae and they leave behind their extremely tiny shells, which bugs hate. Cuts them to ribbons. So this isn't chemically-based or poisonous to humans (though you certain do not want to inhale or ingest it), which I like. I feel good about having this on hand vs. some kind of poisonous spray or even Formula 409 which apparently messes up the sense of smell ants use to navigate."	18
The Gilmour Flexogen is definitely the best hose I've ever had, and they are made in the USA.  Thanks Gilmour!  Mine stay outdoors year round (we have mild winters with only a few freezes per year, but very long, hot summers). They are very durable and don't kink.  I have never had a reason to take advantage of the lifetime warranty, but other reviewers indicate that Glimour makes good on their promise even decades later.  I've noticed a few negative reviews here where the reviewer is mistakenly commenting on a completely different hose.	18
....to really tell if it works as we are short of mosquitos this year and I have not attached the bait that comes with it to attract what there are.  I have had several of these in the past and they proved effective and this should be the same.  Bulb cost is minimal thought limits advertised effectiveness to a half acre.  I'm not sure how they figured that out but our deck is 20 feet from a small pond that hatches these guys and this little machine should be OK to zap 'em.	18
The pruner will not release easily if you grab hold of a branch a little too thick, and at five feet away it's not always the easiest thing to do to notice if that branch is an 1/8th inch too thick.  As a result, it broke on the second day.  Amazon replaced with another, which broke due to same issue, but this time was too late to return.  I bought another, more expensive one that I am happy with and I would recommend it to anyone else: ARS LA-180ZR203 4-to-7-Feet Long Reach Pruner	18
These gloves fit my size 9 hands a bit on the large size but after leaving them out one nice Florida rainy night they now fit just right.  The long cuffs are just right for opening the lid of my Weber Genesis 6611001 E-310 637-Square-Inch 38,000-BTU Natural-Gas Grill, Black.  I have used leather gloves before this and my forearms were always a bit too warm for comfort.  I cook outside about 4 times a week, summer, fall, winter (if you can call it winter in Florida) and spring working between the rain showers.	18
I feel like I am vacuuming my lawn instead of cutting it, and the cord gets quite annoying to constantly move out of the way.  But as far as quality, cost (no gas) and quick startup, it's very good.  I would recommend if you can get past the cord getting in the way all the time....it definitely took me probably twice as long to cut the grass than it normally would with a gas mower just because of having to move the cord over and over again.  But it cut well, was very quiet.	18
Works just the way it is advertised.  Bait the tunnels and moles will die.  What more could you ask for?As a rural country dweller, moles were a constant thing.  Using these and a few other Tomcat products, my yard is no longer covered in mole tunnels.  I will be buying this product again.One caution though, might not be a good idea to use these if you have outside pets that may either dig them up and eat them or eat the dead mole once it has surfaced.  May truly harm your dog or cat.	18
I purchased this to connect two pieces of tubing in an aquarium setup.  The tubing fit on very well, and seems secure.  Just to be sure, I used a pair of worm-gear clamps to be sure I didn't have a catastrophic leak at some point in the future.  This coupling is in use behind the setup - between a very heavy aquarium and the wall, and I cannot access it easily if a leak occurred.  The fit seemed tight on it's own - I only used the clamps out of an abundance of caution.	18
We have a really nice garden that now and then gets hit with slugs, ants, spiders, etc, however after using this powder we have cut their apperance in our garden by almost 100%. It is great to not have to battle different insects all the time and with different methods, this one covers most of them and gets rid of them. I am very happy to say our crop looks good and all our veggies and herbs are doing awesome with very little maintenance. We love this product, it works great! Definitely a buy!	18
I just used it for the first time to suck up the Maple seed(helicoptors)...Pros,It does seem to have plenty of power.It definitly grinds well,Cons,1.) I don't know why these people can't make an extra tube attachment with a smaller size to get in corners and small places...2.) The zipper on the bag is on the side of the bag instead of the bottom.A zipper on the bottom makes it easier to transfer the debris to a trash bag.3.)It just does not feel comfortable,,,you would think they could design somthing that was easier to balance.	18
I easily get two years out of a spool of this string while cutting both grass and weeds on my 18v trimmer.  It cuts clean and level and does not shred even on the harder stuff.  On rare occasions you may just break a little of the end off but that just tears away cleanly on your next trim, so no cutting of the line is necessary.  Yes, it is cheaper to just buy the line and wind it yourself, but for roughly $4 and some change it is hardly worth your time and effort.	18
Attaches to any regular outside spicket or your washing machine line.  Seems to read ok, but I'm not 100% sure because I do not have anything to compare it too.  I think it would be beneficial to have a professional with professional tools measure the pressure as well to ensure the most accurate reading.The one negative I have is that the gauge fills up with water under the glass.  I'm not sure if mine is defective or if they are all that way, but I would think the water should not seep in like that.	18
I wrote reviews on my other Fiskars products and this one is King of them All. I love this axe. With this woodsplitting axe you will not want to own any other splitter. This baby smashes through logs with one medium force swing. The logs explode. I couldn't believe how much wood I split the first day I had this axe. It comes with a great head cover, the axe is light and I think the handle is indestructible. Best money you will ever spend on an axe, especially for wood splitting. No wedges required.	18
We have an open air compost pile that has both yard and kitchen waste. After putting a fresh batch of veggie scraps and egg shells on the pile, I poured the recommended amount of Ringer 3050 Compost Plus 2 over the pile and watered as directed.  A week later I checked the pile and the kitchen waste was already unrecognizable. The Ringer 3050 Composte Plus 2 was doing a nice job of helping the scraps and shells break down.Can't wait till the compost is ready in a couple of months to use in my garden.	18
CobraCo's adjustable flower pot holder is a flexible product that can be used to fit on deck railing up to 4 inches across.  The brackets easily attach in 1 of 2 configurations depending on the width of your rail.  There are 3 screws on each side to lock the bracket down.  There is a bottom bumper support to rest against a post or rail to keep the plant level.  The holder easily accommodates a plant pot of up to 10 inch diameter.This is an easy way to beautify your deck.  Just add plant, and water.	18
Pricey yes but you get what you pay for. This is my third feeder but this one is the best made bar none. It was already assembled but with very well written instructions on taking it apart and cleaning. It is VERY big/long and holds a ton of feed which is good and easy to fill. The top locks nicely too so critters cannot get the feed. The cardinal ring is awesome and within 2 hours many cardinals learned how to feed on the unit. Other feeders no where near match this quality and design.	18
I have to say I finally got this little critters from running anywhere but in the tree.I was tired of them in my gardens and running all night on my roof. When you set up a perimeter of where you do not want the Deer, Raccoons or Squirrels to go. Spray and they will not come in that area. I sprayed and it worked just great. after thirty days I sprayed again, you do not have to use a lot.If you do not have a lot of rain it will last longer, overall good product.	18
Havahart DF32CP-4 Deer Off Repellent Concentrate is an all-natural organic formula that repels by taste and odor deer, rabbits, squirrels and possibly other nuisance animals unless they are starving or otherwise out of normal control, e.g. rabid.  This is not an industrial repellent working against anything that walks, but rather for the suburban home and garden use.  Its garlic, putrescent egg, and capsaicin are not offensive to all people and thus applicable not only in gardens, lawns, and landscaped areas, but also some basements, cellars, and storage.  However, it is ineffective against very determined animals.	18
This is a nice sturdy product but it doesn't work well on my deck railing.  I have a board railing with slats, rather than a thick beam, and the unit just falls off if bumped.  When I move it so it sets against the slat it doesn't lie flat on the top.I can secure it by putting another screw or bolt behind the rail, but it's not supposed to need that. If you plan to order these, get just one first, and make sure it will work for you before buying enough for all your petunias.	18
We live next to a National Park and often get deer in the area.  The major perk of this product is the sprayer, it is convenient to use.  I did notice less deer after using the product, but it did not deter all of them...so it's hard to judge whether it was just a time where we had less deer coming or the product actually worked. Because I live in an area that sees rain often, it is not cost-effective for me to use the product long term unless there is a future drop in price.	18
I honestly don't know if this bait works. So perhaps I should not even be writing a review, but at least I'm being honest. I find a few tunnel holes in the backyard but have never seen moles, so I may not even have any. We do have small roof mice here in Arizona. They tend to feed on the backyard oranges & grapefruit that have fallen to the ground. But, since placing this bait out I have seen no dead ones, so I really don't know if this bait is working, at least on them.	18
The reason people have used this kind of trap for a hundred years is that it works.The TomCat Wooden Rat trap is a breeze to set but PAY ATTENTION. This trap is powerful enough to cause your fingers real harm. I have not had any false triggers off this trap. It has killed quickly and cleanly. None of the little critters have still been alive and biting when I got to the trap. Anyone who has had that experience will appreciate that.Make sure you set this where you know only unwanted critters will get to it.	18
We've been lucky with the herbs, so far. They grow well and we grow enough of them to have all the herbs we want, when we need them. We find it difficult to grow tomatoes and impossible to grow them in any significant quantities. Everything else is in-between. We never tried flowers but we might this coming summer because we have a real outdoors garden that produces everything we need during the summer months.So, go with the herbs, young or post-young woman or man :)The basils are fantastic and we got good oregano and arugula too.	18
I have a large piece of property in Arizona that requires the removal of bushes from time to time and I figured this looked like the perfect tool to cut the main trunk/branches of a dessert bush; NOT!!!!!It was worth a try, but it is clumsy and will not cut through most of the fibrous shoots of a typical desert bush. I am back to the pick and spade.I have many tools for tree limbs that do a much better job than this.I'll give it to my brother.  :>)Note: My rating is strictly for the said application.	18
This nozzle seemed to be well made and it worked great for a few weeks.After about 2 months of occasional use (maybe used it 4-5 times during that time), the whole nozzle started to leak water everywhere. Another reviewer mentioned that the internal components of this nozzle are made from cheap plastic and will break easily from regular use, and it seems they were right. No pressure at all on the trigger and there is water going everywhere. I just turn on the hose and immediately this nozzle starts leaking water.Don't waste your money, get something better.	18
Ship'd from AZ - 15th April - arrived today - 20th - Had almost hoped they would come next week as had promised neighbor they would get a 'test ride' around her more than 100 running feet of flowerbed bricks/edgings - Took less than 1.5 hour.The grip is perfect - the cushioned handles are non-slip / blade length excellent - easy lock/unlock and rounded tips for safety - and 2 boot a 10 yr warranty -Ames True Temper True Temper Pruning Solutions Professional Grass Shear #234930Highly rec. over anything else on the market for the Ames' reliability.	18
We have moles.  This bait seems to be working... there haven't been any new mounds in a week so that's promising!  What I don't like is the applicator on this bottle, it collapses the tunnel too much, and we have to crouch down to use it (hubby has has back surgery, and I get dizzy if I kneel down and stand back up).  I do prefer the Yard Butler GBA-1 Gopher and Mole Bait Applicator because I can remain standing when using it.  But the Tomcat mole & gopher bait in the bottle, it seems to work!	18
I needed hand shears to trim some bushes around my house.  Because some of the bushes are hard to reach, I liked that these have extendable handles.  It takes a little more muscle to clip bushes when the handles are extended but the shears are sharp so it doesn't take much time to get the job done.  They don't clip real thick branches but are perfect for keeping up with unruly hedges and bushes. I like the manual shears because I feel I have more control over what I am cutting.  The extended handle is a bonus.	18
The end you see in the picture with the handy plastic thumbscrew attached is actually a few threads shorter than a standard hose. I have a rain barrel that I wanted to use this with but it will not get a bite on the plastic faucet. My standard 50' garden hose attaches okay, as well as a quick disconnect adapter that I was using, but not this hose. Other than that is is a good quality hose and I will still use it to get water from my barrels to the gardens, just not as I originally intended.	18
Stumbled on to this unit when I was researching power washers on Amazon.  I broke down and bought one for use with my running poorly older power washer.  All I can say is:  I wish I would have had this years ago.  What a time saving life saver.I have only used it once as a test and can not believe it.  It works great with the old washer, so great that I am now waiting for my new Generac Power Washer to arrive.Don't hesitate.  If you do any power washing of decks, driveways, sidewalks, etc., buy this unit!!!!	18
"All I can say is that the 5 people that reviewed this product MUST work for ""Tomcat"" cause these little ""worms"" are as much of a joke as every other mole bait out there.  I have used 5 boxes of these (yes, literally 5 boxes) and I have had NO success whatsoever.  Granted, I must be a fool for spending over $100 on one product, but I have tried everything else and was desperate.  Don't waste your money.  Not sure what else to tell you to try though, outside of making sure that your yard doesn't have grubworms."	18
These are perfect kabob skewers.  Very sturdy, sharp point to get through food, wide flat edge so the food doesn't spin around when you are flipping them as it invariably does with round skewers.  More expensive than bamboo skewers but unless you lose these, they should last forever.  Pay attention to the measurements as these bad boys are long.  I have a WSM 22.5 inch and 22 inch Performer and these fit but not on my 18 One Touch Silver or the little Smokey Joe.  If you have a small grill these may not work.  Otherwise, they are perfect.	18
i was skeptical about these, but i tried them anyway.  glad i did.i was worried that they may affect the water pressure somehow, and my worries were unfounded.  these things are great.  i'm using them for everything.the only problem is that you will realize how many of them you actually need, and you'll buy a lot of them.FYI, i was able to pick up the male+female connector set at lowe's for around $6 (HD doesn't carry this brand).  you may want to check there first before ordering here.  but as far as the product itself goes, it's top notch.	18
I have my garden behind an six foot wire fence.  Unfortunately, one side of the fence is only 4 feet tall due to damage last winter.  I used this product as well as an electronic aid to keep the deer away.  The result was $60 in plantings and 40 hours of labor down the drain.  It didn't my local animals one bit!  Next year I will raise the fence and perhaps install a moat!  Actually, I have a neighbor who had good results with just playing a radio in the garden.  Guess deer do not appreciate good gospel music!	18
I really like this fire pit.  I think it is attractive and durable.  6 months ago I had purchased a $60 model at *arget and I am grateful that I got this one.  I let my husband put it together and he had no trouble as he is good with putting things together.  It is much more heavy than my last pit and much sweeter to look at.  I like the cover, make sure you have let it cool down before you put it on.  We have it on solid stone so we haven't had a rust issue yet.	18
I have been using this product for awhile to see if it made a big difference. It works in a small area, I tried it on a large area and the Deer still came. I tried it around my backyard about 50 feet and it actually worked better. I think the deer get smart after awhile and go around it. The babies run one to three but the parents will try try again. Overall for a small area this will work great for you. A large area you need to adjust all to see how much you can get covered	18
The particular critters we want to get rid of are chipmunks - they're destroying our garden, tunneling into the lawn and even invading the house. The Havahart Critter Ridder is easy to use - just pop the cap and shake onto the ground.  I tried it around a peach tree the chipmunks had been fond of, and it did seem to reduce the number of attacks. I didn't expect miracles, given the number of chipmunks we have around, but it did seem to help for a while. As with all products of this nature, it needs to be periodically reapplied.	18
"Nice dispenser. It will hold up to four 3"" chlorine tablets. I did come across one problem though. Letting it float free throughout the pool allowed it to get stuck in the opening of the skimmer. This caused a decrease of water getting to the pump. Now this would eventually cause your pump to overheat. So I have to keep it teathered to the ladder and let it float free when the pump is off. I seem to have done better just putting a couple tablets directly in the skimmer. But all in all it does what it suppose to."	18
This is the 2nd roll I've purchased, so that should tell you how much I like it.  I got a 50' roll first, and liked it enough to buy another 25' roll so I would have enough and some extra to cover all my yard.This is the first hose I've used/owned that you didn't have to be super careful not to kink.  It always seemed like the higher end the hose was, the softer it was, and the more it would kink on me.  I can just roll/unroll this hose when I need it, and no issues so far.  Highly recommended.	18
I tried this product and it does appear to be somewhat effective at deterring critters from bothering garden and flower areas for a while. It turns out to not be practical for my needs because of the relatively limited working time, and the relatively large expense of the product. I can not afford to continue to apply this product to garden and flower beds. The area I live in is experiencing a drought so a garden is a particularly attractive feeding ground for animals, so the product might work better in areas where animals are not so stressed to find food.	18
We have deer and rabbits.  This works reasonably well as far as we can tell, but you need to apply every few days and after any rain.  We use a garden sprayer to get under the leaves as well.  It would really be good to have an a-b comparison, bt we don't have enough kale and collards to sacrifice to the test - what we do observe is that if you spray, you might get a nibble or two in the next day or so, but if you forget to re-apply after a rain, WHAM - complete defoliation within 48 hours.	18
"I've used this Corona pruning saw fairly extensively.  It cuts faster and more easily than any other of my pruning saws with the possible exception of a Bahco bow saw.  But unlike the bow saw, the Corona fits in tight places, like when pruning deadwood that's inside a hedge.  The curved shape of the blade provides extra ""bite"" and is a good feature.  The cutting action is on the pulling stroke, which is highly effective and keeps the blade from kinking.  The handle is well-shaped to feel comfortable and secure.  In sum, this Corona saw works very well and is recommended."	18
I&#8217;m not the person on mouse duty in my house or outbuilding.  My husband does the varmint control and does things like set the traps.  Emptying them is certainly not my cup of tea.  We rural and get a lot of field mice, especially in the barn where they tend to nest.The weapon of choice has always been simple traps, but every now and then when we get a lot, my husband has opted for poisons.  He tried this Tomcat Mouse Attractant, but still prefers the old peanut butter method.  Why?  It&#8217;s simply a lot less expensive and works equally well.	18
This is not what you want for heavy duty wear, like dragging your knees around on concrete all day.  These are light-weight and comfortable in that binding area behind the knee:  Perfect for kneeling to do work in your garden.  As a gardener, with several veggie gardens and plenty of shrubs and rose bushes spread over an acre and a half, these knee pads are perfect.  Both my husband and I have a pair.  They have a lifetime warranty, too!  I couldn't ask for more.I love Fiskars and when I have a choice, I always choose Fiskars:  This brand very seldom disappoints.	18
I bought the B&D Cordless Hedge trimmer a few weeks ago based on the comments made by the people here in the reviews.  I am very pleased with my purchase. I found the power to be adequate for trimming shrubs around the yard. I didn't find the weight a problem as did some who reviewed it. The safety lock is an inconvenience. As some did, I fixed it to where it would stay in the locked position. It makes a big difference. Time will tell how the batteries will hold up. So far I have no complaints. I would recommend this trimmer	18
To begin, this thing is HUGE.  (The measurements provided don't provide a good &#34;picture&#34; of how big it is).  The assembly is straightforward but strange (It kind of &#34;snaps&#34; together).  I haven't had any problems with the thing falling apart, but it seems like it could at any second.  I move it around on my patio with things inside and it stays together.  If you need some extra storage space for outdoor items, you really won't go wrong with this for the price.  The only reason for the 4 stars instead of 5 is because of the way the unit is assembled.	18
I lost my pruners in a move and had let my plants get sadly overgrown while I was SURE I was going to find my old pruners. Finally, my front yard looked pretty ridiculous and I came here in search of relatively inexpensive bypass pruners. I read lots of reviews and decided to go with this, and I'm glad I did. I had no problem using these to cut small branches and bushes. The handle felt comfortable in my (fairly small) hands, it hasn't stuck or jammed, and they feel like they're made to last. Thanks for steering me right, other reviewers. :)	18
Fiskars has given me great service over the years, so while I didnt used to have brand loyalty to any particular lawn tool maker, I now buy their products when available.  They're all well made and work well, this is no exception.  The gear drive is smooth and powerful, and as you might expect from a company with its roots in expensive scissors the blades are exceptional and dont need frequent sharpening.  Make sure to spritz a little wd-40 or other light lube on this and any tool with moving parts before using, it'll make them last longer, work better and prevent rust.	18
"This charcoal slow-cooker & smoker does everything as advertised.  It is well made and easy to assemble.  I have done 2 cooks so far (baby back ribs, chicken, sirloin tip & salmon).  As long as you don't keep adding smoke-wood, but only do it at the beginning (and do it sparingly) you will have well cooked and flavorful food.  I recommend trying the ""best ribs in the universe"" procedure for your first cook - found at [...]  I highly recommend this cooker and think you will do the same.  P.S. - Amazon.com has about the best prices and delivery you will find around."	18
Lots of reviews so I'll keep it short.  I've used this both on, and off the pole to the point where if it died I'd still be happy with it, but it's still going strong.  Lots and lots of use.  I keep it sharp, adjusted and use the prescribed 30 weight chain oil.It also allows me to make cuts either from the ground, or on a ladder, when I'm in a better position to get out of the way if something falls.  We've used this to safely make the final cuts on limbs that were still hanging from a gas chain saw cut.	18
Great for protecting baby fruit/nut/landscape trees from deer rubs.We have a lot of property in GA, mostly timberland, but with some fruit/nut trees planted on some cleared land where we have a small hunting cabin. We've tried a lot of different methods for keeping deer from rubbing all the bark off and killing the young trees -- this spray seems to be pretty effective. Just apply it around the time they start leaving rub marks, and trees stay safe, and alive. A little expensive, but a good option for those who don't want to bother with physical measures like protective sheathing or fencing.	18
If you live in a rural area, you know how much damage deer can do to a garden. Havahart repellents are the best on the market and this one is no different. One of the best features of this repellent is the built in sprayer. This allows you to use it the moment you notice damage and without having to mix up anything.Another great feature is that there are no harsh chemicals involved. Just garlic, eggs and hot pepper capsaicin. This repels both by scent and taste. It is safe around children and pets and long lasting, good for up to 3 months.	18
I have a bird feeder on top of a 10' pole, which I thoroughly soaked the Havahard Deer Off.  5 minutes later a squirrel climbed up the pole through the Deer Off.  I chased the squirrel away, and he was back in another 5 minutes.  The Deer Off did not even slow him down.What DOES work for me is greasing the pole with automotive grease weekly.  I had hoped that I could apply the Deer Off less frequently.  I also worry about poisoning the squirrels, since they obviously remove the grease from the pole physically, on their underbellies, and then lick it off.	18
According to the package, this is a slow working poison and would leave moles suffering for two days before they died.  (I might be willing to let a nasty rat suffer that long, if necessary and found no alternative, I will admit.)  But, it seems a cruel and inhumane for a cute little mole.  And we only have a mild issue with them.  We will seek another solution.Perhaps you have a mole issue rampant enough to justify that, and if so, I'll not certainly not judge you.  Just, well,&#34; there's the facts&#34; on this one.  I'm not willing to torture the little guys.	18
I used Safer Brand 5168 around our flower garden when I noticed a couple of trails of black ants trying to move in. I placed some of the powder down as a barrier around the garden the ants for the most part ignored it. I came back two days later and still found a few ants going back and forth across the white powder. It looked like it slowed the ants down but not eradicated them as I was hoping.  Maybe it was the batch I had it wasn't as quick as I would have liked seeing in getting rid of the ants.	18
It looks like it came right out of an episode of Leave It To Beaver but don't be fooled by this retro-looking nozzle. This feels great in my hand and functions way better than the plethora of nozzles I have tried in the past. The trigger has a real nice, snappy, feel to it.Unlike my other nozzles that are made from plastic, I actually think this will survive a winter outdoors in PA. The only thing I have to get used to is that the type of spray is determined by the pressure I apply on the trigger. Everything else about it is perfect.	18
I have a spout in my garage that sits about two feet off the floor. So I needed a short length hose to use for filling up buckets, watering can, etc. This fit the bill perfectly. Install was a breeze and it is well made, so it should last for a long time. The only draw back for me was that the hose is way to stiff. It sits in a curled up position and always retains back to that position no matter what I try to do to remedy it. Overall not a deal breaker for me as it has exceeded my expectations.	18
I have lots of mulched areas in my yard. After using Havahart Deer Off II, I have noticed that the squirrels and rabbits do not go near those sprayed areas. It is wonderful to not have to clean up the mulch everyday...and plants can continue to grow! The sprayer was amazingly simple to use with the battery powered sprayer and it takes much less effort than using a hand triggered device. I don't have any deer around my property, so I can't address its effectiveness in keeping them at bay, but it sure worked for repelling the other critters. I'm looking forward to spring!	18
Deer Off is the first product that I have used that really does keep them off.  BUT, you need to reapply it on all new growth and new buds.  It does't stop them for a month or two (and it doesn't claim that it will).We finally had two growth periods before those little devils came in and clean out the next bloom crop!  But, I will still recommend it to others in my neighborhood.So, this is a good product but I'd like to see it work for at least 60 days or 2 bloom cycles.  That's why I gave it a 4 star rating.	18
The mixture works, and it's nothing too scary, but it has it's limits.First, it's not really for vegetables, due to its' smell/composition.  That being said, it totally worked on decorative plants.  Deer came and left without a nibble.  For some, this is a great scenario.  For others, well the nearby but unsprayed veggies, not so much.  There was an overall reduction however.Second, it's not too cheap.  It's not the priciest solution, but it's not that cheap either.For a smallish ornamental garden, this is a great solution.  For vegetable gardens, maybe not.Overall it's not bad, and the sprayer is the real deal.  I loved it.	18
This thing is amazing! Made of steel, very durable and incredibly versatile. It opens as wide as 22 inches for when raking leaves on your lawn, drive-way, etc. and the best, which was freaking great, it closes to 7 inches, which helped a GREAT deal when raking leaves from the street curb.This rake is light, manageable and very easy to use. I didn't experience is strain or felt tired while using it. A great tool that I promise you won't regret buying. I loved it so much, I gave one to a co-worker and my in-laws. Trust me, you won't need another rake again.	18
Before, when I went to buy a new brush I would always get the cheapies; I thought they were all the same, except some came in plastic while others came in wood or aluminum. I was wrong. You do get what you pay for when buying a grill brush, so buy this one! The bristles are stiff enough to clean up all the grit, yet soft enough to not damage your grate. The brush feels nice and sturdy, it feels well built. Also, this brush has a handy scraper on the end which is extremely handy with the really tough crusties (on your GRILL silly).	18
Herds of deer patrol our yard and shrubs and they've done serious damage.  We've fenced our vegetable garden and put netting over other shrubs that we don't want the deer to eat, but such solutions are not always convenient.  This is a clever solution that doesn't take a lot of space or skill to implement but isn't cheap either.  So far the deer have kept their noses and mouths off of our unfenced tomato plants protected by one of these.  Some otherwise vulnerable flowers appear to be receiving protection from the others.  Testing to make sure that they're working involves a mild shock.  Oh deer.	18
Best leaf rake I ever owned. The 5ft lightweight aluminum handle is perfect for us &#34;mature&#34;  individuals who prefer things easy to use. The rake part adds another foot to the length and is two feet wide at the very tip end. The plastic rake part is attached to the aluminum pole with a single screw. That makes it a simple task if the rake part needs replacing. This garden tool makes raking almost a pleasure.Prime members can have this delivered to your door for just under 16 bucks. That is one heck of a deal for such a fine rake. This is a winner.	18
hello,everyone knows about fiskars quality scissors.  these are no different, they are top quality.  they are very well made and the grips are so comfortable that it makes garden work fabulously easy.  one hand shovel is good for moving a lot of dirt.  the other is sharper and is good to cut various wild roots.  the rake is used very little, but was included in the three pack of tools.  the two shovels get a good workout in the garden.  fiskar products are tops and this three piece tool set is right up there for necessary tools for your garden.  great product, service and delivery.	18
I was hoping that this product would keep the squirrels out of the fruit trees, but it didn't phase them.One of our pear trees is far enough from other trees that they can't just jump from tree to tree, so I decided to try this product around it.  Less than an hour after applying the product all around the tree, the squirrels were crossing the band to climb and retrieve fruit.Other reviews seem to indicate that it work from some people in some situations, but our squirrels are determined to strip the fruit from every tree and this product didn't stop or slow that process.	18
This is a nicely made feeder, easy to assemble, fill with seed and hang.  I have had it up for about a week and so far no squirrells have  been able to get to the  food!  I have it hanging from a shepards hook  that  is cemented into the ground! The birds have had no issues that prevented or made it difficult for them to eat at the feeder.While it is nicely made, easy to assemble etc. it is in no way worth $72!!!  I can't imagine anyone paying that kind of money for a bird feeder that is suppose to keep squirrels out of it.	18
First, the noise level is low.  Nothing that's going to drive humans crazy.  Second, the Wiggly Giggly Ball is everything it promises to be.  Tough, makes low-level noise, and requires no batteries.  Love that.  Though my current dog didn't go bonkers over this ball, I've had dogs who loved batting them about.  My dog is into noisy toys but not balls so much.  But I'd still recommend the Wiggly Giggly Ball for its quality and durability.	19
My rescue Wiemer.  barks when I move, get out of bed, walk, ect and sets off the entire pack.  It was so nerve wracking.  He must of had one before.  He welcomes it.  When it warns him...he gets a funny look on his face and doesnt bark any  more.  Peace at last.  I almost cried to put it on him.  But he learned so quickly he doesnt seem to get shocked.  Thank you so m uch	19
She loves this dinosaur...seriously loves it.  She has many shapes of the Nylabone products--this guy however is by far her favorite.  The head, feet, tail--all chewed off, only the center body is left.I like these because they are designed to massage gums, clean plaque from teeth and as a doggie bonus, they are flavored.  I do recommend the dinosaur in particular on her behalf--she can't type but from the rate of chew, this is a good one.	19
I have 3 spoiled dogs.  Puperoni was the only pricey soft treat they'd eat.  Then I tried beef Zukes as something cheaper and different.  They smell awful to me, but the dogs all grabbed these little squares and gobbled them up....to my surprise.  I then bought the Chicken Zuke's, which they rejected.  So It's back to the beef recipe.  Since all my dogs are older, I figured that the extra benifit of 'hip action' would be a good thing	19
Wanted to try on my own to get rid a my cat's tapeworm. I had seen the white pieces of the worm on her rectum. It was 3 pills.  The first one was wasted, mainly my fault.  The second one was given in a really good treat.  I think she ate most of it.  Have not seen any tell-tell signs on her rectum since then so I am assuming it worked.  The delivery was very fast.  I will use them again.	19
I bought one of these at PetsMart, and my puppy loved it, so bought another one on Amazon.  They're good, but don't last too long; maybe a week, more or less.  Puppy has lots of toys, but when he FOCUSES on this one, it gets worn down rather quickly.  It's not too expensive, though, but I've also taken to freezing a wet washcloth for him to gnaw on.  Great soaked in broth or stuffed with kibble then frozen for 20 minutes.	19
"I purchased this thru Amazon about 3-4 months ago....and it suddenly quit.Worked great until then. Not sure who to contact......UPDATE:Contacting the company and found out that Amazon is not a ""designated distributor"" for their product so they won't take it back!!I tried to take apart the pump as per their suggestion and found out the pump impeller was Broken!....and the whole thing is now good as a door stop.I don't have the money to waste.And this was definitely a BIG WASTE."	19
The trouble with Glucosamine/Chondroitin supplements is that some of them work and some of them don't. And sometimes a brand that has worked stops working. So far CosaminDS works. I hope the manufacturer doesn't try to increase their profit by reducing the active ingredients. So far it's the most effective Glucosamine/Chondroitin I've tried.Edit: They work better than any other supplement I have tried. But best to order them in the cool months, so they don't spend the several days in above 100degrees.	19
Both of my Pit Bulls adore this toy.  It's a little shorter than the regular one, but still goes a good distance.  It holds regular tennis balls and anything that size.  When I first started bringing my new dog to the dog park, the Chuck-It was my way to get his attention, and for him to follow me to the exit to leave so I didn't have to chase him down.  It's like it hypnotizes my dogs.  Gives them fabulous exercise too!	19
I've been using these for years. The last one lasted over 10 years before it started making noise. I expected the new one to be as quiet as a mouse, just as the old one was when I first installed it.However this one is even noisier than the old one. I threw away the container, and obviously it's used, so what now? Am I stuck with this?  I can't believe it. I just paid $50.00 for more noise. What is going on?	19
I have this over my fiddler crab tank. It's a 10 gallon. It keeps the tank between 73-80, even if it's down to 64F in the house. Of course, I also have a heater in the water (fiddlers use both water and land) so that also helps with the temp. I would use something with more wattage though, if you have a bigger tank. I've had the light for about 3 weeks now, and have had no problems, but time will tell.	19
I have a 25 pound mini goldendoodle.  I thought no way does she tear through this &#34;indestructible&#34; teddy bear.  Lasted all of 5 minutes and she had both ears off and the legs torn off... What a joke.  KONG should not be allowed to sell such garbage.  I read the reviews and thought &#34;well they must have a pitbull or a larger dog&#34;... NOPE, my 25 pound doodle ripped it in minutes.  Stay away from this one and go with the fire house toys.	19
As a big fan of the Dr. Noys toy line, I was quite disappointed when this bear arrived. After searching in the bottom of the box for it, I found it drowning in the peanuts (just kidding). This size is seriously more appropriate for something like a Yorkie or chihuahua. It's too small for our 20lb. mix, and definitely not ten inches tall as the description stated. Still, our dog has tossed it around, and I've found Dr. Noy's toys to be quite durable.	19
I purchased this for my cats to try after a recent flea incident in the house.  I tried to mix the suspension with their food (I tried dry food and wet treats)... they sniffed it and walked away.  I then followed the instructions and had to hold the cat and squirt the suspension into their mouth.  It was messy, they hated it.. and I felt horrible trying to get them to take all of it.  I'm sticking with Frontline Plus...much easier for my cats.	19
I'm disappointed to say that there are very few bubbles, mostly very tiny and they pop as soon as they touch something.  I gave it a thorough test, blowing air at different speeds and angles, shaking the bottle before using and then using it when it hasn't been shaken in a couple of days, etc.  Total letdown.Important to note: both I and another person who gave this a shot felt stinging in our eyes when the bubbles popped close to our faces.  Not good!!!	19
Despite some of the negative reviews, I purchased this item anyway because there were far more positive reviews.  WHAT A MISTAKE!!!  We went away this past weekend where on Friday I set up the timers to open on 2 separate occasions during our absence.  We returned Sunday morning to see that they never opened.  My poor cat is 8 and a half years old and he went without food for 48 hours!!!!  We feel so terrible and guilty.  I'm returning this piece of &#$*$*#	19
Cheap 'n' cheezy, just like all the newer LitterMaid receptacles are.  Sure wish they would bring back the older, sturdier ones.  Really makes you feel like a captive market, since you don't have much choice but to use these if you want to use the LitterMaid.  I line them with bags, but the receptacles are so thin that they crack and split after about 3-4 uses just from putting them into and taking them out of the LitterMaid, so have to be replaced despite being lined.	19
This 11-12 quart container is exactly right for the size bags of cat food I buy--not the huge bags, but the eight pounders.  The profile is slim and unobtrusive and while I could wish it was sturdier, I think the unit will survive average domestic use.  The top locks securely, but isn't a nail breaker to get off; the latch just kind of rolls up.  The non-locking side is hinged which is nice for keeping everything together.I'm very pleased with this.  So, apparently, are the cats.	19
I've been using Stress Coat since I ran out of my other water conditioner.  Stress Coat works fine -- at least the fish look well.  The cap can be used to measure out the conditioner, but I have a five gallon tank.  I change about two quarts of water a week, so each batch of water gets five drops.  That's been working for me, as my fish have lived a few years and they're getting big.  One 16 ounce bottle will probably last until they die.	19
Hey if my dog loves this thing that means is good! I know, you'd be like all dogs love food, but mine is different. He eats mostly meat, and this is just like something to be over there. I usually give him a coup and a half, and will last him 1 1/2 day. He is very picky when it come to dog food, and this was the first time when he actually eat that just like that. I have an old school pitbull, 67-68 pounds average.	19
I typically pre-treat most stains prior to carpet cleaning.  This is a ok pre-treat but I likeBISSELL Tough Stain Pre-treat for Carpet & Upholstery, 22 ozbetter.  I have beige carpet and this cleaner seems to occasionally leave a residue that leaves my carpet with a pink tinge.  I've been able to remove the substance by waiting until the spot dries and going over the spot with the carpet cleaner a second time.  For lighter carpets, I would recommend theBISSELL Tough Stain Pre-treat for Carpet & Upholstery, 22 oz.	19
I bought this for my 10lb mini doxie and she has little to no interest in it. It's super rock hard! I may try to put some peanut butter on it to make it more appealing but probably will give it to my parents' golden retrievers to see if it interests them. Also, I was unable to choose which dinosaur shape I wanted at checkout. Kind of inconsequential but I really wanted the Tyrannosaurus Rex! Instead I got the Stegosaurus. Perhaps that's why she doesn't like it :)	19
Frontline Plus is the only product I've used until present when we started using a multi-purpose Heart worm topical that includes some tic and flea protection.  Seems one still needs Frontline type protection anyway..Consider getting a syringe and small container (available on web) and splitting larger does Frontline over two or more applications.  I'd not be comfortable using one so large that it took more than two or three months to use it all - and keep the unused portion in a cool/dark place I have been told.	19
keep it clean and i would say it works  if rite from factory. I have.  deep 6 hydrometers  that are 15 years old maybe older that still work well.  That's 5 star in my book as long as its accurate when new  keep it clean with fresh water and look close for air bubbles ...i have had 4 Instant Ocean SeaTest Hydrometer that the counter weight fell out with no way to fix  and 3 instant ocean testers that didn't work at all  ThoseFishGeeks. comCounter weight falls out	19
Charlie, our maltese/pomeranian mix is happiest when in the car with his head out the window. I got these googles to protect his eyes from the wind and debris.  We've got great pictures of him in the goggles, but they have to be snapped very quickly because he won't keep the goggles on for more than about thirty seconds.  I'm not sure if anything can be done about this in terms of product design.  But unless your dog is completely docile, this will likely be a wasted purchase.	19
It works very effectively. I had one of my cats with the tale, tale signs of tapeworms, the rice pods (eggs) in its fecal matter. The gas it passed was enough to make me gag. It was quite unpleasantly odiferous. After 1 day of administration of the medicine, she passed a tapeworm about 9 inches long. So I treated the rest of my cats. They are all fart free. Indications are, if one has tapeworms, the rest do too. Now, time to get some good flea meds for them.	19
"Normally, I love Frontline Plus for my dog. However, I chose to order this from Amazon because the price was cheaper. This frontline did not work at all. Something was wrong with it. I order alot of ""thinks"" from Amazon and never had trouble before. I have had dogs all of my life, used frontline plus ever since it came out, and it always worked. I ended up buying Frontline Plus from another reliable place and it works ""great"" just like it always did. This was a bad batch."	19
I ordered these to use in a deep water culture hydroponic application.  They produce a good flow of bubbles, but will vary depending on size of air pump.  Heavy enough to stay put and wont float in my buckets.  UPDATED.  After a summer of growing awesome cherry toms these stones held up to roots and nutrients.  Amazing roots like spaghetti noodles, I definitely attribute this to good air flow in the buckets.  I put one in my Aquarium after and I like the bubbles and so do the fish.	19
Like other Planet Dog toys, this ball is good, but not the best.  The knot in the rope comes undone quickly, so you will have to tie it again.  Also, if you have a constant chewer/mouther on balls (and don't just use it for fetching), the outer shell of the ball can come apart off of the inner shell that has the continents on it.  But that is usually after lots and lots of chewing.  Other than that, my dogs LOVE these balls.  They love the softness and the chewability.	19
Our dogs love it.  We rescued two woofs and one of them was severely abused.  Mange, fungal infection, abuse, no fur...horrible skin.  Dr. told us that he probably wouldn't get his fur back.  The rescue folks suggested Nupro Gold as they've seen wonders with this product.  It's hard to say if his fur would have grown back on it's own (and some of it on his face did not return) without the supplement, but we did use it and his coat is now beautiful.  We are continuing to use it.	19
I picked this up for my brackish 46 gallon tank.  I liked it because I could replace the media with bulk media (using a drawstring mesh bag). It's a little overkill for this setup, but it keeps the water super clean.  I've got 3 puffers and a load of guppies in there and 0 nitro, 0 nitra, and 0 ammonia.  Water changes every 2-3 weeks and no issues.  I had a puffer die and when I took it to the store, they were confounded on how clean the water was.	19
"What's to say, a replacement convenient cartridge?Please note that when it first slows the water down I canclean it out with pure water a few times to extend the life.Another neat idea, if you tank gets at all dirty or you reallywant to get your water super clean, get ""old school"" fiberglass and spread it out and put it as a pre-filter beforethe filter.  It's has much more filtering capacity thanthe cartridge or cotton.  You can find fiber glass in laboratorysupplies.Don't know why they no longer sell it for filtering."	19
I have a very active and sweet Border Collie mix who loves chasing and chewing. I try hard to match his energy level, and for the most part succeed, but there are times when I just can't. This Nylabone is perfect for keeping him busy during those times when I can't be playing fetch or chasing him around the house or yard. My only slight concern is whether a hard chewer can crack or break their teeth, or damage their gums during excessively hard and long chewing sessions. Excellent product.	19
This is a durable and soft plush doggie toy - The dogs have a small basket full of toys, but Lambchop is one of their fav's to pick out of the box and tussle around.Has a couple squeaker's - so if that drives you crazy you may want to consider something different.Lambchop has also been machine washed and dried in the dryer (on low temp) several times and survived just fine.I have even purchased them a replacement for when the old one does bite the dust, they will have another -	19
This product has better ingredients at a better price than some lesser quality foods. I'm still debating making my own dog food. They suggest not giving dogs table food, but cheaper dog food typically costs $1/pound. I have a difficult time purchasing food for my family that's $1/pound (we eat A LOT of chicken for that reason). Chicken is currently $0.49/pound. Homemade dog food is looking very cost effective these days. Either way, apples to apples, this is a reasonable purchase. It doesn't cause my dog flatulence like some other brands.	19
The previous dog I had, had gotten this toy and just loved it. She would love to squeek it and throw it into the air to catch it again. When I got another dog, I gave her the toys I had saved and she picked the hedgehog out and for some reason, she loves this toy too. So when I wanted to get a 'welcome' gift for a friends new dog, I bought this. He loves it!!  And it lasts thru many hours of play. Very sturdy..even thru tug of war.	19
"Then this is the kit for you! Kit includes everything you need to make brightly colored fluids out of your fish tanks' normally clear-ish water. Made me go ""mwah ha ha ha haaa"" the first time. Quality kit, the test tubes are great and having 4 allows for simultaneous testing of the key parameters. Extremely helpful as I did a fish-in cycle and needed to monitor closely to make sure no one died. ;) Thanks to the kit, all 3 fish survived the cycle, and we are now a mature tank!"	19
"I have purchased this item frequently over the years but this time the liver bits were fractured and mostly too small to handle. Using treats for dog training requires bits that can be held in the hand and fed. If they are too big or too small it is hard or impossible to work it. Perhaps I got a bad batch but about 20% of the container was ""powder"" while another 30% was too small to hold. About half the bin was useful. Win some, lose some. This was a loss."	19
I've read some bad things about cloth perches (dangerous because of potential tangles with feet, dirty, etc.) but I know that my birds prefer these to any other kind of perch and I've never had a problem with them.  I keep 1 of these perches in each of my cages as the upper most perch, so that they don't get pooped on when birds are up higher.  I've noticed that my birds like using this as their sleeping perch.  It must feel better on their feet than cement nail filing perches.	19
My 70 pound Lab loves this toy! She is a bit scared, but still interested enough to play with it. She is a chewer so I had to cut off the nose because she was trying to eat it, but other than that she has not chewed the toy up. She got one for Christmas and accidentally broke it when I threw it and she caught it and her tooth hit the box that makes the noise. I ordered 2 more for her. This is her favorite toy and it is durable.	19
Our 90 pound husky just had ACL surgery and I bought this so he could get in and out of the SUV.  It is a great ramp, easy to use, very sturdy, a cinch to unfold and very lightweight.  The tread is very good and provides for sure footing.  We have used it outside over a few steps for him and it has been left outside in the rain overnight.  It is plastic, so being outside doesn't hurt it and the water runs right off it.  I am really happy with it.	19
I'm suspicious of the packaging because I've never seen it, and it does not match the picture shown.  The package I received has a different dog on it, and the UPC has been replaced with a sticker with a different UPC on it.  I am returning this because it does not match the packaging at my vet, nor at other pet websites that sell Frontline Plus, approved in the U.S.Update: Surprisingly, Amazon will not allow a return on this item because it's considered hazardous. So with that thought in mind, buyer beware.	19
My box was definitely genuine because I bought it at Costco. Did NOT get rid of adult fleas and the infestation is as bad or worse as ever. I have to find something that works because my pets are miserable and the house has fleas now too. Too bad these medications are all becoming useless. They used to work so well. Does anyone know which one actually works nowadays. All these meds are way too expensive to fool around with duds. I need something that works and is safe for my dog.	19
My 18yr old cat has had CRF for over 2 years. She  has never really liked her prescription renal food but tolerated it. Recently she has been losing weight and not wanting to eat her food. I thought I'd try the Hi-Tor after reading good reviews on it. I'm so happy I did. My cat loves it!!  I'm so happy to see her eating again. The food is very moist and she just digs in. It smells tasty too compared to that dried out canned prescription food. She is one happy kitty.	19
I'm only giving this three stars, not because of the product but because of the way it was shipped. The box on arrival was smashed, when I opened it, the tray and cover for the kit were totally destroyed. I've thrown away the tray container, ordinarily I would have sent it back but I needed this kit badly...I've decided to keep the rest and will make something to keep everything together with. The product is easy to use and accurate, I've been using API products for a while and I trust them.	19
First Impression: Nutri-Vet heard about my website! They decided to send me a bag of their Peanut Butter flavored biscuits. Well what dog doesn't love peanut butter??? Right now my hips are fine, but I'm a young pup at a mere 13 months. I'm sure as time progresses I'll run into some sore joints, just like all large breed dogs do. So I'm happy to know that there is something out there that can help, and tastes as good as this!Conclusion: Tastes great, no animal bi-products, resealable bag, and it tastes like PB!	19
The pup liked this toy very much, but I do not recommend if you have any type of carpet in your house.  We don't even have carpet - just a few wool rugs, but the toy was soon the most disgusting thing in our house.  All the rug fibers and dirt and slobber matted around the nubs on this toy, making it very unpleasant to touch.  We tossed it outdoors, and it wasn't much better.  Those nubs grab everything gross and use slobber as glue to make sure that it stays that way.	19
I have a medium sized dog (king charles / bichon mix) and he is a big time chewer.  He's been working on this for over 6 months now and he's done some damage to the tail but still has not lost interest in it.  The only &#34;con&#34; I can think of for this toy is that it does have a large collection of sharp points which I suppose is great for teeth cleaning but a pain in *ss when you step on it running to the bathroom in the dark at 3am. :)	19
When our dog plays with this thing she throws it in the air and when it lands it sounds like she just threw a brick.  Minus the loud nature of this toy it is great, our dog is a powerful chewer and she can put bite marks into it but that's about all.  We have had this toy for about 5 months and it is still intact but with hundreds of bite marks in it.  I would strongly recommend NOT stepping on this.  Overall this is a durable toy that our dog loves.	19
This chew toy has lasted thru several strong German Shepherds.  The original lasted nearly 5 years.  No noticeable pieces of the toy seem to be laying around the house or in the dogs stools.  It really is a tough toy and although it's probably made in China (products that I detest), I've seen no adverse reactions to the dogs using it.  It is a bit heavy for the small German shepherd female that we have, our 125# boy plays with it like tossing popcorn.  I'll definitely purchase another when this one wears out!	19
I recently ordered three different Wellness Canned Cat Food varieties. I ordered the chicken, beef and chicken, and turkey. My cats LOVED all three and couldn't get enough of the food. I found the consistency to be perfect as well with the perfect amount of moisture or broth that my cats love. I did not have any problems with damaged cans that some users noted. I am ordering another case of all three flavors and I will keep this review updated if I come across this problem in future orders. Overall, highly recommended!	19
My 13-year-old Persian thinks this stuff is pretty good.  He has that disease, Lymphocytic-Plasmacytic Gingivitis Stomatitis, which means he had to have all of his teeth removed since they attack his body, but doesn't have any trouble getting these down.  He usually eats mostly wet food but he enjoys this dry food quite a bit.  Plus, he doesn't toss up his lunch anymore since buying these which, in my opinion, is the best part.  The price is fair here on amazon too - it's higher in the local stores here in Ohio.  Recommend!	19
I bought the first one and the cat liked it. Do not over microwave, it will melt. The trick to having it last 8 hours is the pets bed.I am using this for a mini doxie, 5.5 lbs, I bought her a tunnel bed, and she wears a light sweater, with the snuggle in her bed she is not waking me up to put it inthe microwave at 3 am.Mini dogs have to be kept warm, they die fast. I micro this and put in her car crate when we travel around town.	19
i was having a lot of trouble with my hip this summer and my chiro suggested i try this in addition to taking it a little more easy in the gym.  i was happy to try it since i was popping ibuprofen like pez.  it wasn't immediate, but, the pain has pretty much subsided. i'm finally running again and the only pain i feel are in the muscles that are still tight around the side of my hip. i am making sure to gently stretch and foam roll to reduce tension and soreness.	19
My dog loves hedgehog stuffed toys. She carries them around and then lays with her paw on top of it, as if to show the world it's hers. Unfortunately, my other dogs are not as gentle and as soon as she looks away, they tear the thing to sheds.For non aggressive chewers though, this toy is great. It has the duck sound they love as well as a squeaker. I'll continue to buy these for her, knowing they won't last, but that's ok cause she is so happy when a new one arrives.	19
After reading the good reviews of the Booda perch I placed an order for one........what I received was an Aspenpet brand perch.  I wanted the Booda brand as all the reviews for other cloth perches were not that great......I looked all over the cardboard information that is around the perch and no where on it is the brand name Booda.......I will use it & try it but it is NOT WHAT I ORDERED!!!!!! The only thing the description said was COLOR may vary NOT brand!!! Did arrive on time and packaging was perfect.	19
"I should have read the reviews before purchasing.This is incredibly finicky about precise fill level. I must have overfilled by 1/4"" or so, because it stopped working properly after the first day. The scooper still scooped but the thing seldom opened the lid of the receptacle.With such shallow litter, my cats had trouble digging and covering.The fact that a scoop is included in the package is informative.I gave it two stars instead of one because the charcoal filter does a good job of odor control. And another clock in the house is always handy."	19
Puts Frontline to shame. It killed them initially, but they came back and/or didn't get rid of them completely. Other products worked at first, but more showed up only a couple of weeks later.Advantage started working immediately and has kept them away. The only disadvantage I see is that it doesn't kill ticks, but my cats don't go outdoors so I'm more worried about fleas. Put it on my cats and it also took care of the fleas on my ferret without having to put any product on her which was another big plus.	19
I normally buy the Large, super durable Nylabones for my 35lb shepherd mix.  However these were on sale so I decided to give one a try.  Both of my dogs LOVED this bone as soon as it arrived.  However, it is much smaller and softer than the bones I normally buy, and it did not take long at all before it had been chewed into something to small for my dog to safely continue chewing  on.  If you have smaller dogs who don't have a shepherd's powerful jaw, then this bone is for you.	19
I used this to diagnose a water quality issue with a tank I set up.  I seeded it with filter media from an established tank and thought it was cycled after a couple weeks.  This kit allowed me to monitor ammonia, nitrite and nitrate to determine it wasn't cycled at all.  After several more weeks, levels were good and stable and my fish are doing great.Get this and some cheap pH strips for quick checks.  It can save a lot of time and money avoiding having to guess what's going on with your water.	19
He LOVES dehydrated liver.  I make it for him all the time, so I thought he'd love THIS, too, and it would be good when/if I didn't have my homemade dehydrated ready.  I bought two big containers and he won't touch it!  I ended up giving it away. I think it's the freeze drying process.  Dehydrating keeps the flavor better.  Have YOU ever eaten freeze dried food?  I have and it tasted awful. So, it you want to try this, get a small bag first, so you don't waste your money like I did.	19
I have the Zoo Med Double Dome lamp. I use this bulb as a night-time heating source for my box turtle, in conjunction with the 100 watt, Powersun bulb during the day-time. I never turn on both bulbs at once because that would be too much. I have seen my turtle come out and bask on her log as needed while this bulb is on, so I guess she is happy with it. I have had the bulb (and the turtle) for six months. I have had no issues with this bulb so far.	19
I bought one of these and ended up using it for the neighbor dogs more than my own because of the fact that he would not bring it back to me to throw again. Recently, at the age of 2 he has now realized the point of fetch and loves how far I can throw the ball with this. He plays until he can barely catch his breath, so I have stop and give him breaks, otherwise he would just keep going. Also keeps the slober off you and on the ball where it belongs.	19
I bought this excitedly thinking that we would have another option for our heavy chewer (lab/shepherd mix) to go along with the Nylabone Big Chews we buy. Our dog had inch-long gouges in this bone within 10 minutes, and was pulling off pieces larger than grains of rice in 15. This was not a good fit for our dog, and I'd highly recommend keeping a close eye to make sure they're not getting big pieces off when you first give it to your dog. You just never know. We still buy the Big Chews religiously.	19
My female kitty had an UTI and the vet ordered her the VET-only supplied UTI food at a very high price. She didn't eat it at all, neither the dry nor the wet kind.So I bought some of this Pro Plan UT Focus formula. She eats it - not exactly with great pleasure - but she eats it and since weeks we had no more problems. As mentioned by many other customers, the &#34;cheaper&#34; food is as good as the one that the vet tries to sell with a big profit. I recommend it anytime.	19
Cat food storage solution.IRIS Airtight Pet Food Storage Container, 11 Quart, GreenOur curious kitty decided that her food bag in an extra large ziplock to deter ants was something to chew on when bored.  Needed to keep bag intact and ants unable to smell food.  This does the trick.  Just poured the food inside the container and snapped the lid shut.  Kitty has knocked it over, but not opened it.  And it's easier to use then the ziplock was!  Plastic isn't flimsy and the flip snap latch is holding up well on the hinged lid.	19
I have quite a few tanks ranging from 5 gallons to 65 gallons. Our local water supply likes to juice up the lines with ammonia every now and then to clean them. This much to my dismay almost killed my entire tank of breeder cichlids. This stuff is way better than anything out there and keeps it all humming along happily with the oodles of water changes I do.I've used them all...this works best and I notice the least amount of disruption to the cycle of the tank and the overall happiness of the fish.	19
I bought this for my Betta Fish and found it does not keep the water clear longer. I suggest using distilled or purified water when cleaning a Betta Fish tank. Once you've transferred your Betta to clean water (do not use tap water), rinse and clean tank, gravel and fake plants with HOT water. Refill 1/3 of tank with distilled or purified water, Pour  fish back in tank and fill tank to 3/4 of distilled or purified water. If you have a Betta, you don't need this. Do you best not to over feed them.	19
My cats got infested with fleas and I had a hard time getting them under control, as a result I had many outbreaks of tapeworm in my three cats.  The vet bills got expensive after awhile, and since I had learned to identify tapeworm infection, with some research, I deemed these safe.  I am an infectious disease researcher myself, so I do have some experience.  These do work, BUT please ALWAYS check with the veterinarian FIRST before you try to self treat your pets.  The wrong treatment for the wrong diagnosis can lead to damaging consequences.	19
"This is the only ""hard"" synthetic chewy my dog is really interested in. It is slightly pliable rubbery material - but he's had others with a similar feel that he wouldn't chew as long as this. Not sure if it's the nubby texture? I bought this size hoping he could hold in his paws, but it's still a little short (he's a 20 pound dog). We end up holding one end while he chews - with his eyes closed and an expression of pure joy. He works pretty hard at it for 10 minutes or so."	19
This (Aquaclear 20) is also the same filter included with Fluval Edge tank, and is very quiet and does it job cleaning the tank.I bought AC20 for my hospital tank and cleans it as it should.What I like about aquaclears compared to other hang on the back filters, is that you don't need to keep on buying filter cartridges. The included foam and ceramic filter should last you a couple of years. Just wash them gently form the water from your tank, or water treated with antichlorine stuff, to preserve the beneficial bacteria.Enough said, highly recommended!	19
I ordered this product and the bottle I received had a completely different label, I got Mardel Quick Cure with a blue label, it looked nothing like the yellow label pictured here, perhaps its the same thing and the company was sold, but who knows. I tried the product for &#34;cotton mouth&#34; on a few of my cardinal tetras, it looks like the fungus has shrunk in size but after two weeks of the 1/2 dose recommended for tetras they still have the white growths on their mouths, i will move on and try something else.	19
I bought this mainly to add variety to my Betta fish's diet.  The fish love to eat this and it does not seem to cloud or otherwise pollute his water.  The worms are a bit small and hard to feed to your fish.  Also some people have reported allergic reactions (there is a warning on the product about this as well) so keep it away from small children.  The container has a child safety lid which can be a bit frustrating for some. Other than that this is a great product that your Betta will love.	19
It arrived in different packaging, but as far as I can tell, the product is the same. It came to me in a non-transparent red bottle. It gets the job done and it doesn't irritate my kittens' skin. It's a bummer that this is an add-on item, but I ordered two bottles and so that should be enough to last me for a long while. Doesn't have any noticeable odors, either.4 stars because when the bottles arrived, they had both leaked all over the place. Luckily the other things in my package were wrapped in plastic.	19
This product has worked wonders for me with small, external fungal growths and bacterial infections that developed on many of my fish during a columnaris outbreak.  I prefer to use it as a 10 - 30 second dip at a high concentration, or as a 30min - 1 hour bath at double concentration.  I've even dropped it directly on the fish's infection and the fuzz was gone right away with no adverse affects.  It's nice because you can mix it with Kanamycin, Nitrofurazone and/or Metronidazole for an even more effective bath when treating severe bacterial infections.	19
My dalmatian just loves her dino. it was her fav nylabone that she got for christmas. the only thing i don't like is that the ends are easy for her to chew up and become sharp but other than that it is holding up well. she is a power chewer and we haven't had any problems with it breaking apart (note-she is only allowed to use most of her toys under supervision. just incase). she also has a large slection of treats and a couple of kongs so she doesn't chew on just one toy all day.	19
"All 3 of our dogs love the various vitamin-enriched ""tasty pastes"" available from Kong.  Although they loved to chew on their Kongs before, we found that they really got into it when we inserted some of the paste into the cavity.  All of them go ""nuts"" when we put down the ""pasty Kongs"" for them to enjoy - and enjoy them they do!I would highly recommend all of Kong's ""tasty pastes"" - it's easy to use, doesn't seem to make any mess, and is a great extra treat for dogs.  Our 3 give it ""2 paws up""!"	19
We purchased this to keep our dogs food in. It's very convenient and much easier than having to sift through a big bag. This container easily holds her 30lb bag of kibble with room to spare- in fact I'm betting almost an entire second bag would fit too. The wheels make it easy to move and we can store this in the pantry. It has kept the dog and 2 cats out of the food so far. I only wish we had opted for a smaller size to fit the pantry better, but I really can't complain.	19
These amazing beads really clean up my aquarium tank to a clear crystal quality.  It would be nice though if the manufacturer had included instructions on how to clean and recycle the beads (I had to call customer service to find out).  Also a pouch to put this stuff in would be nice.  Tried it with my wife's old nylon panty hose; after several uses, the nylon breaks up due to the bleaching agent required for cleaning.  Overall though, the product is truly amazing.  I gave up using charcoal filter altogether.  Your fish will be happy too.	19
My little dog likes these toys and I like the fact they have no stuffing.  They provide an extra squeaker but she will quickly kill both the squeakers and then just drag the little bear around with her.  This is her second one of this same toy because she liked the first one so well that it eventually just started to fall apart.  It did last for quite a while though as she normally can destroy a toy in a day.  She just kept looking for the stuff on this one which was funny because there is none.	19
I bought this for my very enthusiastic lab who was OBSESSED with chasing balls. She LIVED to chase a ball. This one was more economical, I didn't have to pay shipping due to Amazon Prime and it was quick delivery. Unfortunately, Maggie passed away at the age of 3 in her prime. She passed due to complications delivering puppies. The breeder offered me another dog. We will be going to get her on Saturday. She will be enjoying it in Maggie's memory. Our new dog won't replace Maggie but she'll fill a hole. God Bless you Maggie !	19
My cat Foutchie is heading toward 5 now and no one told her the trouble with a kitten is it eventually becomes a cat (so take that Ogden Nash!).  She still voom-voom-vooms around at a pace that makes me exhausted.  She loves toys, especially stuff she chases.  So the bubbles are great full.  Especially since they are catnip bubbles.  You don't have the worry about them getting soap on them and making them sick.  She love jumping high to pop them.So if you are looking for something to awaken the kitten in your kitty, you might try these.	19
Unlike a lot of other filters, this one lets you use your own media. BUT you may not even need to because unlike other filters, the inserts are super cheap. I got the surface skimmer attachment, it looks a lot nicer than the green intake tube and cleans up film on your tanks surface.I got this 50 for my 30 gallon salt water. If you are doing salt water you'll want a higher rated capacity filter than what your tank actually is. If I were to buy again I'd go even another size up to the 70 though.	19
I made the mistake of going for large capacity. These work to good and seem to suck some the gravel past the grates and eventually get clogged. Also the red adjustment to reverse the flow requires dismantling the pump and remove the red insert to get the arm to move back to full suction.Other than these negative this pump is great. I would buy them again but in a smaller size.Vent tubes absorbed water, turned white and shrunk within 6 months in fresh water. Mount design is excellent and strong and input funnel has good range of adjustment.	19
I was disappointed in this one - Nylabone Durable toys are the only toys I buy for my powerful chewers because they are the most durable I've found to withstand their chewing. This one did not live up to the Nylabone Durable name. I gave it to one of my dogs, who is not the most aggressive chewer in the pack and I had to take it away from him the first day because he was able to destroy part of it and chew off pieces.  I will go back to the Nylabone Durable Souper bones from now on!	19
Our dog is an American Eskimo and we live in Miami, Florida. We have exterminated the yard, his bedding and had been using the Preventic Collar.  We also used Rose Geranium oil, all with no success of the tick infestation on our dog.We finally tried Frontline Plus and it has been a couple of weeks now and we are still having the same tick problem.  Adult ticks and baby ticks.  It's not doing a thing to help get rid of the tick problem so far.There are no fleas at all and plenty of ticks on the dog every day.	19
I got the 2-meal version of this product. I have two cats, one of which is very food aggressive and will do his best to get into any container that smells like it has food in it. He was able to get into this pet feeder within an hour by prying open the flimsy plastic top.I like the idea behind it, however. The timer works well enough, but is not for precise timing (you can get it within a half hour or so). This would be excellent for cats that aren't food-aggressive or clever enough to figure it out.	19
I went through a few other brands of training treats in my day - but I would stand behind Stewart's before any others.  simple, freeze dried liver... no additives, minimal calories means I can give many a day to satisfy my training needs.I do cut these up into about 1/3 size for my puppy initially, means I can give him 3X more per day then what is recommended and again, is great for the constant reward system of new dog training.Just saw they have a Pork flavor released too - looking forward to trying it in the next order!	19
I have been giving this to my 2 dogs for about a month and their hair is so much softer than before. My pug hair was kind of rough on the back and now it has become super soft. My boxer hair has become shinier as well but i have to put him on less amount because it was too much for his digest system. He was having diarrhea until i cut back on this to half and now he is all good and healthy. Both dogs appear to have more energy and i would definitely recommend this to anyone.	19
We bought this because our cat liked to get into our other container. This container is well built and seems to be fairly adorable. The lid has a nice hinge on the rear of it and they Latcha on the front to keep everything tight and seal. On top of that inside of the lid is an O-ring that will match up against the whip of the container to keep the food fresh inside. This container fits a full bag of cat food with just enough room to put a little scooping cup in the top. Highly recommend this container.	19
Okay so these Vitamin C wafers are delicious! A great way to boost your immune system. They help me get over a cold and relieve scratchy sore throats. My only complaint, and it's not really a major complaint, is that when I bought the Blueberry, Raspberry, Boysenberry flavor I was expecting there to actually be 3 flavors in the bottle. As it turns out there is only one flavor and it is a MIXTURE of Blueberry, Raspberry and Boysenberry. The flavor is good, mind you, but still I would have preferred there to be three separate flavors in one bottle.	19
I've seen the comfy perch in the local pet stores, but was hesitant in buying until I had read the reviews on Amazon.  Therefore I decided to order the item to be delivered, and not worry about the crowded local stores.  I just received the comfy perch, and my 3 year old cockatiel gave me a like tweet.  She always looks like she's smiling, (lol).  I attached it inside her cage, and she step onto the perch, and seem to love the feel.  I'm completely satisfied, and love that it's makes her happy.  The product was also delivered super fast.	19
Quote Ziggy on this bone.My 60 pound boxer/pit mix is a fan. It's no stick or real bone, but it seems to be the next best thing.  He's been chewing on it on and off for a few weeks and hasn't gotten far which is nice.  I guess he likes the different textures and shapes, but I can't telepathically talk to the pooch so I just take the chew marks for what they are.It doesn't smell and it doesn't get slimy. 3 weeks of him chewing on it and it's still in great shape, so it's lasting a while too.	19
We have a one year old shepherd, boxer, pitt mix and he liked this toy a lot.  But then we left him alone with it one day (as we often do with his Kong toys) and he ripped it to shreds.  I didn't know that was possible with Kong Toys.  We'll stick to black Kong toys from now on. The good news, my husband put the bulbous end of using a saw and now we use it as a somewhat durable ball for play in the backyard.  So we still got some use out of it, just not its intended use.	19
Purchased Diamond Beef Meal and Rice - dogs loved it at first....  I mixed it in with their old food and all was well for awhile, then I noticed that after about a week they stopped eating it all together.  Even when I left it in to bowl and didn't give them their old food for a short period, they wouldn't eat it.  I noticed vomit on the floor and saw my dogs both start to drink LOTS of water.  Bad sign - giving up on this stuff.  Read about their problems with recalls - bad choice to buy this product!!!	19
I have used one of these for years and bought this one recently.  The quality is the same.  I am the caretaker for a spayed/neutered & vaccinated small feral cat colony.  I heat these in the microwave one at a time before I take the cats' water and warmed food out to them.  The water goes on top of one disc and the food atop the other.  In this cold weather, minus 10 to 20 degrees, these discs keep the food and water from freezing for about an hour, long enough for the cats to get there and eat and drink.	19
Love this product!!! My old dog has been taking this human grade form of Cosamin DS for years and it's kept his joints limber.  It's cheaper to buy the human grade than it is the pet grade for him.  I like this seller and as long as the prices stay reasonable I'll stick with ordering from them.  I also give him Earth Animals holistic : &#34;Aches/Pains drops directly into his mouth 2 x a day to ward off any pain from old age. (don't give your pets drugs that will destroy their organ's)  He's doing great!  Hope this helps someone else.	19
This dish is too deep for cats but what really annoyed me was the 45 minutes I spent trying to get the label off. I tried peeling it off, using soap and water, then Goo-gone, and then Goof-off. I scraped and rubbed and there is still a ton of adhesive stuck to the side of the frame. Now there's cat hair stuck to the adhesive. Lastly, when you lift the feeder up you have to make sure you hold it by the frame, otherwise the bowls pop out onto the floor. I threw it in the trash after about a week.	19
we got the 47-quart capacity container and it holds a 40 lb bag of dog food just perfectly. almost too perfectly...if you constantly buy 40 pound bags, maybe consider the next size up so you don't have to wait until the last minute to refill (because 40 pounds fits just right, you have to wait til its literally out of all food). so far it's been great for us, but in retrospect, i might have gotten the bigger one. great container though, lid opens easy, it holds up, locks freshness in, and keeps the dog food smell inside where it belongs.	19
Simple review; I LOVE IT! Believe me, I looked all over the internet, looked at all those Youtube reviews etc etc. This is what I found and what I purchased. It 's the best!. Buy it, no hassle, easy to use, comes in a handy bag with all the goodies. The steady view (IS) is AMAZING!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! It 's like a digital camera that you focus.	20
I got the 10ft model---This is a throw away rod,it breaks,oh well,go buy a new one....except mine won't break,I treat it like a red-headed step child...So the guides are off,it sticks together sometimes and the craftmanship ain't all that great..IT'S 25 BUCKS!!!! Go buy a Croix or any other high end rod....500 BUCKS!!! Find the cheapest reel you can and put it on this rod and come over to Castle Island and we'll do some fishing	20
This is as pictured.  This holster is excellent for UNconcealed carry such as hunting.  I can't see it being concealed with a full size firearm, like my Ruger.  It fits the firearm well, but it you push the firearm into holster, it has kicked out of safety while walking.  Hence the 4 stars.  I have tried different angles, but always seems to fit same.  Maybe other firearms, with a different safety system, have no problem.  Great seller,great price.	20
My son is a basketball fanatic.  And at 15, in just a year and a half of playing seriously (pickup games, etc.) he has become quite the fanatic.  He already had 3 previous balls he plays with.  But when he saw this one he said 'yep, that's pro quality' with a long smile.  The grip is so good, the response is up there also.  If you want to bring a smile to your players face you can't go wrong.	20
I'm XL in everything else, but in these, the Large fits properly.Unfortunately, the pad seems to be one size, and that size is XXXL.The fabric is smooth and durable.  The stitching is clean and looks nice.Unfortunately, there is a stitch in the very front and center, most of the way down to the pad.This chafes way too much when riding.  It's a severe design error that should never happen.Basically, I think these designed for women, and sized for men.	20
We had a rip in our aerobed on the bottom-middle.  I used this to repair it and it's held up really well!  We even had my lineman brother sleep on it for a week (without deflating it once) and it was just fine!  (For non-football fans, that means he weighs somewhere between 275-375 lbs.)  Both of my parents slept on it for a weekend, also, and it stayed inflated throughout the entire time.  Bonus: it's super easy to apply.	20
"I bought this for a Remington 700 XCR Tactical with the Bell & Carlson green/black stock.  The green cammo sling color is identical to the stock color.  My stock comes with two mounting studs on the foregrip so I also have a Harris Bipod (3-9"") mounted.  With the bipod mounted it doesn't give the sling much freedom of movement so I end up removing the bipod until I need it.  Like everyone else said, this sling doesn't slip.  Highly recommended!"	20
The assembly was relatively easy.  It does however stink to high-heaven until you air it out.  We left it outside overnight, and by the next morning one side had a rust stain on the blue cover.  I don't know how that happened, but oh well.  My daughter likes it, and does use it frequently.  It is a bit small, so you must put it somewhere with at least 3 feet perimeter for safety.  I still recommend it despite the horrible smell.	20
This is a way fun sneaker for tricking or Parkour.  I also use them for gymnastics, they fit well, surprising, I wear a 10.5 and they are surprisingly well fitting.  They are lightweight and fun, really cool for flipping and trampoline follies (literally in my case).  They don't real have the right structure for suspension trainers (I'm a TRX Qualified Trainer), I'd use minimals for something like that.I don't know wushu from mushu, but they are comfortable and fun to wear.	20
"This is a nice little speedloader for the price.  The rounds don't fit 100% secure when locked in place, but this hasn't been a problem for me.I will be buying another.  4/5 stars, and I only took one star off because of the slight ""jiggle"" of the rounds when it is locked in place.It feels like quality material, and it works quick, releases the rounds when you want it to, and is a good fit on my S&W; model 10 .38 special."	20
I've been using Hoppe's products for more years that I will admit and have always been pleased with them. Of course their #9 is a classic, but their brushes, jags, rods and patches are all top quality as well. Sure other companies make good stuff too, but I know I'm not ever going to be disappointed with anything made by Hoppe's. Check out their new Viper bore snake, by the way. Just when you thought there wasn't anything new in gun-cleaning technology!	20
"I have used lots of traditional and not-so traditional frisbees and this is the best yet.It is just the right weight and size, flexes nicely during catches and flies very, very far.It also slices through strong winds really well and doesnt seem to ""Float"" as much as other disks; so goes where you want it.My children, 5 and 7, have finally learned how to throw and catch because this is easier to throw and catching it doesnt hurt their hands.I recommend this product."	20
I'm speaking only for using for Ruger SP 101 . It works perfect & flawlessly.I recommend for SP101 users to go with &#34;Star shape&#34; one.A little more expensive but those cut out groves on &#34;Star style&#34; will help to not get engaged with the grip when it's in use.HKS 36 does the work if you know how use them .If you try the HKS and the Star style,you'll get the point.I do have them both styles and use them all time.Satisfied after all.DT	20
The first time I ever used a bore snake, I had my doubts.  After all, I've been cleaning firearms (large and small) with a rod, for years.  But the first time I used a Hoppe's boresnake, I knew that I would never, ever go back to using a rod.  Boresnakes generally get the barrel clean with ONE PASS, don't scratch the bore, and are easy to clean and reuse.  And, as always, if it's says &#34;HOPPE'S&#34; on the label, there's quality to spare.	20
"If it's 20lb test, SAY that it's 20lb test.  Don't do the ""20/8lb"" nonsense.  It means it's 20lb test with the same diameter as ""normal"" 8lb test monofiliment.  What's up with that?  When did fishing become a techno-weenie adventure?Not at all what I wanted.I'm dropping the staars for a very confusing product description.  I can't use it on my reels, and can't rate it as a fishing line, but the guy I gave it to was very happy to get it for salmon fishing."	20
Love the fact this scooter can fold for storage or when taking with us in the trunk of the car.  Though I think the clip you flip to fold this could be easier.  (My ten year old doesn't have the finger strength to push the clip down to fold it).  That's a little disappointing, but Razor's use of quality metal, foam and plastic more than makes up for this little annoyance.If you're in the market for a child's scooter - Razor is the best.	20
Everlast is a well known name and they make good products.  I wanted something cushy for my exercise class so something a bit more thicker than a yoga mat.  This is definitely thick and cushy.  But.... it's kind of bulky and heavy to carry.  It does have handles but it is still kind of cumbersome and I am pretty strong.  It was not worth returning so I will deal with it.  But if I had to do it over, I'd buy the yoga mat.	20
1) To replace the batteries in them, get ready for a battle.  DUMB way to do it.  Just dumb.  Have to pull off or pry off the soft rubber circle, with hard insert the rubber circle attaches to, which NORMALLY means you will rip or tear the soft, rubber circle....2)  Turns on accidentally WAY too easy when folding them up, or throwing them around, thus dead batteries, thus having to replace them MUCH more often then you should have, thus, enduring #1 too frequently.	20
I've had this for a few days so far. Fairly easy to install, seems about as durable as the original Casio strap (i.e. it should last for a few years and then break, just as all my Casio straps have). It's a good match for the Casio watch. Good thing it came with spring bars, since this watch has solid non-spring bars. One oddity - the strap is slightly wider than the inside of the buckle, so it's a bit hard to pull through.	20
This little boresnake is great for .22lr rifles, especially the Ruger 10/22.  With that rifle, you must clean from the muzzle to the receiver when using a traditional rod and patch.  This is not ideal as you can damage the crown of the muzzle.With a boresnake, however, you can clean from the receiver and exit the muzzle.  Quick, easy, and does the job on the Ruger 10/22.I gave this 4 stars instead of 5 simply because I think this should sell for approximately $12.	20
Works great on firearms with a fixed trigger guard.However, on my two lever-action rifles, it's not very effective -- probably no surprise, given the design. On an older Winchester 94, I can get position it to lock the trigger guard and trigger together, with some effort. On a Winchester 9422, it attaches itself to the trigger guard, and it just slides off of the trigger itself when the lever is used. The rifle can be loaded, cocked, and fired with the lock still in place.	20
This was a great surprise for the money.  I looked at resistance band workouts on YouTube and decided to try it out. At this price why not?  I really feel like I had a good workout after my first try.  The door anchor worked great.  I'm 71 and keeping big equipment around the house is just not possible.  This I just keep in my night stand and any time I've got some extra minutes I do a little workout.  Pleasantly surprised and pleased.  I highly recommend.	20
It is hard to assess a product like this.  If it does what it claims to do - namely provide UV protection - then it is a superior product to others products like Armor All, which makes stuff &#34;look&#34; pretty but provides no UV protection.  UV rays murder things exposed to sunlight, esp. rubber, fiber glass, etc.  I regularly apply it to my trailer cover, tie down straps, boat hull/deck and the likes.  Until proven that it does not work, I will continue to use it.	20
I have owned three of these stoves over the years.  i gave the first two to my kids and ordered this model.  The windscreens are cheaply, made, fall off the stove which then doesnt  support the rear screen.  Once closed it required a hunting knife to open because the inner deck stuck to the lid.  The right burner worked fine but the left burner flamed inefficiently.I feel this stove is a piece of junk and Coleman ought to feel ashamed of the sheet metal worksmanship on it.	20
If you have the extra money...buy this for the fun of it. It shoots a bullet of air that is strong enough to catch any unsuspecting soul off-guard.Initially saw one in use at DollyWood; one of their magicians used it in his act, and it was hilarious.It makes a bit of a &#34;pop&#34; (thats obvious) when you pull back to shoot it, but if you're in an area where unsuspecting folks are its too funny not to use.Safe, fun, easy to assemble, kids and adults will enjoy.	20
I had one for my XD and now have a few more items I wish to keep SAFE from others using.  Not only a great price they are awesome to use and easy to change the codes for locking/unlocking.  I had lost the directions form my years ago one and nor have the easy instructions to change the codes.  Insert a pin into the opening and change the codes, how easier can it be, I could of had a V8 moment when I saw this....Silly me for forgetting...	20
Just so nobody gets confused here, this is a very small pocket knife. To be worn on a key chain. Nothing remotely what is considered EDC (every day carry). But here is why I got it: You get a small blade which is good enough to cut open little packages/string/etc. Scissors, a nail file and what I like the best....tweezers and a toothpick. None of the high priced Leatherman etc. multitools have tweezers, and if you ever had a nasty splinter you know how important tweezers can be.	20
Was going to install a Yakama rack to my car, and instead of buying it as a compete kit ($1400 out of the box), I searched the Interwebs and found the items piecemeal ($375), so I thought I needed these plugs.  Turns out I didn't need them as they already came with the &#34;Yakima Round Bars Roof Rack Cross Bars (58-inches)&#34; which I had ordered here on Amazon.So, for quality, can't really tell ya.  They are a rubber end cap--they aren't going to rock anyone's world (I hope).	20
"Although the description says ""One size case fits all speed loaders"" it should say that ""one size case fits all HKS speed loaders"".  Other than that caveat, the product does just what it promised to do.  If you have a different brand speed loader, then you might not be able to use this case.  Since HKS makes speed loaders for almost every caliber, this should not be an issue.  I have both HKS speed loaders and non-HKS speed loaders so I won't be able to universally use this."	20
I got one of this knife as free item from Swiss army gift pack. I gave it to my 10 years old daughter who is a town boy loves it. It's very easy for her to use and carry it with her. Most likely she use it for craft work. Then she wants her friends to have it, so I bought all different colors for other daughters as birthday gift, even very girlish girl (she got pink one) likes the knife too. It's a very cute and excellent tool.	20
"I have owned many different Swiss Army and leatherman knives.  In the end, the only things you really end up using are the scissors and the blade.  This has both of them - although they are quite small.  This is not one of the full size knives.  This is more of a ""keychain"" knife.  Although you will need to be careful not to take this to the airport.  I keep one of these in my desk drawer at work and another near the front door (for use opening packages.)"	20
What I like:Aesthetically pleasing to look at, handle and use.  The stainless steel is very appealing, and holds a nice shine.  The tools opening and locking have a very substantial, visceral click.  The curve of the plyer handles are very comfortable.It comes with a very nice, light-weight nylon SNAP pouch (I hate the velcro ones).It's lighter in weight than a Leatherman Surge, which is what I carried for the past ten years.What I dislike:Nothing.  I'm willing to sacrifice one-handed blade deployment for what I consider an aesthetically superior MT.	20
Arrived fast. I blew it up to check for holes since we don't plan on using it until this summer. The oars were fairly easy to assemble. The pump is cheap and fell apart easily but we have a nicer one that we use anyway. The kids loved playing in the boat once it was blown up (even if only in the living room). I can't wait to take this to the lake this summer. It's going to be a huge hit with the kids. Deflated easily for storage.	20
Not much that I can say in a review for a weight tree.  This thing does exactly what it's supposed to.  It's sturdy, wasn't too hard to put together, and holds a solid number of plates.  The bars are a little close together so it can be difficult to maneuver too many larger plates, but for most collections it should be fine.  The bottom peg is too cramped for anything larger than 2.5s or 3s in my experience, though some 5s may be small enough depending on the brand.	20
I purchased this to clean my ruger 10/22 since it can only be cleaned from the muzzle end. I apply solvent, in this case Hoppes 9, let it sit for 5 minutes while I service the rest of the weapon then I run this bore snake through two times, then apply more solvent and run it through again twice.You take the brass weight and drop it through wherever you wish to clean, and pull the snake through.Good product, I wish it were US made, it is made in China.	20
What can I say, it's a BoreSnake, it does the job. Not as thorough as a standard cleaning rod with patches but in most cases it is good enough for a light day at the range or a routine maintenance-cleaning of stored guns. If I have a heavy day at the range I usually run this BoreSnake through a couple times with CLP to get the big stuff and then finish-up with a standard cleaning rod. I would highly recommend. I also have these in 9mm and 30 caliber.	20
Great knife.  Not sure about the mixed reviews on the sheath.  I optioned for the Nylon with a plastic insert (where the blade goes in).  Works great and feels like its built to last.The knife and blade are everything I was looking for.  Although it is a bit smaller that I thought it would be.  BUT I have no plans on returning it, just planning to pick up the full size version as well.I did shop around after deciding on this knife and by far Amazon has/had the best price	20
These earmuffs are amazing. The price is the best on the internet.Do not listen to the other reviewers who claim that it is impossible to install the batteries.Any competent person who reads the directions can do it in 1 minute.As for the complaints regarding the on/off knob, when you take them off and are about to place them in your range bag make sure they are switched to off.These earmuffs work how they are supposed to, they are low profile and look nice and at this price are extremely affordable.	20
I am shooting these into a Yellow Jacket target at 30 yards distance with a Barnett Wildcat with a red-dot scope (came with the crossbow) firing at 350 fps.  The only reason I need to buy more of these is that they fly so consistently true that I need to replace them periodically because of damage inflicted by hitting them with other arrows.  Not bragging, just commenting on the quality of the arrows!BTW, you cannot buy Barnett 4-arrow quick-detachable quivers without 4 arrows with it as part of the package.	20
I applied this to a new boat cover to waterproof it using a hand spray pump. I think they key is really saturate the fabric with this product, allowing it to penetrate. The first rain has come, and the water is literally rolling off the cover in huge drops. Cover still looks perfectly dry. I have a 20' boat, and used almost the entire bottle to waterproof it, so it does take quite a bit.It's expensive, but it has worked great for me so far so it's been worth it.	20
I like to use them after my range time to give a quick wipe to the pistol so it doesn't go in the bag totally dirty. When I do the strip cleaning and further clean the gun, it leaves the Teflon coat on the finish and don't quite like the look on the black so I further wipe with a blue towel or a micro fiber cloth before I put the weapon away. I'm going to buy the other brand just to compare.  I'll post my review when I'm ready.	20
This must be more ideal for a handgun.  The locking bar did not fit behind the trigger on my AR-15, Remington 12 gauge, nor my Reuger .22.  The instructions state that the bar does not have to go behind the trigger, however, when I tried that, I could still manage to pull the whole thing and activate the trigger on the AR and shotgun.  The .22 was the only gun I had that this would absolutely stop the trigger from being moved.  I should have returned it, but I was lazy.	20
Got it today, way quicker than I expected or was said, it's so cute, it's tiny, got it as a gift for my fathers b-day who has all mac stuff, laptop, phone and think ipod, so this goes along with his style, didn't take it out of the box so as not to finger print it up, though it is really cute and think he will like it.  Has toothpick and tweezers.  Assuming like my old faithful swiss is sharp as can be though won't find out till he gets it.	20
I've been using Dr. Bronner's for many decades. It's my favorite camping soap, but is a refreshing wash-up anywhere. I use it to freshen water bottles too. It gets rid of that funny plastic taste and smell. Larger quantities are cheaper than the smaller bottles you might find at your local mountainously overpriced sports stores. I gave it four stars because I do prefer the original formula that was stronger and left a size-able tingle on your skin, but even toned down it's a great soap. I'll continue to buy it.	20
"This Spalding Tack Basketball is very tacky. It makes it easy to palm the ball and provides a light soft touch. Using the ball mainly on indoor courts, it holds up well. I'm doutbful that the texture could withstand a lot of use on an outdoor court, but after a few uses outside, it is still in perfect condition.I like this ball a lot, but I only gave it 4 stars, because I noticed that whenever we pick the ""game ball"" for our pickup games, everyone shies away from these balls."	20
"This Airzooka Air Gun is awesome!  This was a really cool Christmas present for both the 17 year old, and the 13 year old boy!  It was a really fun way for them to ""fight"" each other, and have a war WITHOUT anyone or anything getting broken or injured.  Even the adults seem to love shooting it at each other.  But if you're worried about messing up your hair I wouldn't recommend getting shot.. It really does shoot a blast of air.. nothing to forceful.. but will mess up your do!"	20
I got this as a backup reel because my ancient Abu Garcia reel I have used forever is getting to be a little ragged. For $13 you cannot go wrong at all with this reel. The weight is perfect, the reel is SMOOTH as can be, and I was able to use it with ease as a left handed caster. I put Cajun line on it and had no problems whatsoever. I like this reel so much, I might buy another one! For such a low price, this is great quality!	20
So I specifically purchased these patches to clean my guns after range use.  I paid more for these because I wanted an absolute lint free patch, that would not leave traces of lint on my gun after cleaning.  Well, I still havent found the right patch.  When I clean the outside of my black gun with oil, these patches leave lint on the gun.  I then have to get a microfiber cloth to wipe of the residue from the patches.  These dont absorb oil like other patches, but they are strong.	20
Exactly what I needed, a belt that holds rounds for my shotgun and doesn't poke or prod me in uncomfortable places. It holds more than enough rounds for a belt piece and adjusts on the sides nicely, but what belt doesn't? The side adjust cinch is tight and doesn't stretch or come undone, however this may become less sturdy as time goes by but we'll see. Not a lot of bells and whistles, which I like. Straight to the point, exactly what I needed for the coming apocalypse ;) good hunting.	20
These pads are all rubber and roughly 1/8th inch thick. They are easy to carry inside the original box. The white color gives maximum visibility which helps when placing on grass or on a dirt field. Because it's real thin, it's better to flatten / trim tall grass to avoid bending too much.All in all it's a serviceable set of pads when playing in a park or patch of grass. But for more serious games I think it's better to look for base with more height to the pad, like real bases.	20
"This is my 3rd or 4th Spartan.  It cuts, opens drinks, corks, screw drivers...  It remains flat in my pants pocket.  It's not particularly heavy for an everyday carry knife.  The only thing that could make it a better knife for me, would be a single hand opening main knife blade.  My other everyday carry knives open with a flick of my thumb, so when I go to open this, ""oh yeah... 2 hands...""  Other than that, I cannot recommend this knife enough.I tend to buy the red one for loss prevention."	20
I&#34;v read many articles and checked blogs and there is a lot of talk about how easily the remington tactical contracts rust.  With pump type application I think you don't waist as much as using the spray can.  I have the remington cleaning towel and I use the pump bottle to add a little more rem oil to the towel.  I haven't noticed any rust at all,  yet.  I suppose I'm a remington fan and I like everything remington to far.  But I&#34;m open minded to any product that does the job.	20
In my opinion, bore snakes are a must when cleaning.  I don't recommend this to be the ONLY method to cleaning but should be a supplement to the cleaning rod and patches.I typically use the bore snake after the rod and patches to make sure I really purge whatever junk is in the barrel.  Then I would run a light coat of oil afterwards.  That may seem excessive to some but with the possible threat to our gun rights nowdays, we must take good care of the wonderful firearms that we have!	20
If you are engaged in speed shooting, these are just about perfect. I had my seamstress aunt make a band that fits around my left upper thigh. I thread this on, fill the carriers and stick 'em in. I can flip the cylinder out of my 686 with my right hand and push the empties while I grab a new set and drop them in with my left in about two and a half seconds. I normally set the flaps so that they're only holding on by about an eight of an inch.	20
To me, these knives are like socks in the dryer. Every so often I just lose one. But like socks, I use this knife daily. Not as a knife proper, but to pick on things, open this or that, fasten or tighten a screw. I finally learned not to use my teeth to rip on packages and find this knife in my pocket instead. The small jeans pocket. This should be a standard issue, everybody should have one and the TSA should lay off. Nobody is going to highjack a plane with this one.	20
This knife is perfect for on your keychain carry. I went to a bbq this weekend and it was used multiple times for three different things. I had to pull it off my keychain because everyone needed a bottle opener for there beer. The scissors were used to open a capri sun that the straw was lost for a kid. And the knife was used to open a present. And when I told people it also has a pen they were shocked! awsome little knife just get it and put it on your keychain.	20
These pads are made nicely. I like how you can put on the pads without having to slide them up the limb. This helps if you already have the rollerblade on.The sizing is way too big for my 3 year old. The elbow pads barely fit my child's knees.The main drawback of this set is that it is missing wrist guards which I think are extremely important. The most likely fracture point is the wrists.Overall, I prefer theRollerblade Pro Junior In-Line Protective 3 Packwhich are smaller in size and come complete with wrist guards.	20
Originally I had bought the Howard Leight Impact Sports electronic muffs but had to return them due to fit. I bought these to replace them and I really like them. The fit is really nice and they are comfortable. The noise cancellation works well too in outdoor and indoor ranges. I didn't find the battery compartment too difficult to get in to using a flat head screw driver. The negative thing I found was that the on/off button knob fell off when I first turned them on. Perhaps putting some locktite might help there.	20
For the price the rod is worth it, but its a cheap rod that performs on par with its price. Not something I will be taking out fishing anytime soon. Barely flex the tip and you can hear it crack and pop.  Im afraid a decent size fish will destroy it. BTW, I ordered the 7' for channel cats. Ill keep it as a backup or loaner. But, if you buy it, you will get a rod that is worth exactly what you pay for it. Im going back to Ugly Stick Catfish rods.	20
This product is excellent for anyone just getting into the game of tennis. For the price range, this hopper is a great option compared to what you'll find in most sporting good stores. I've seen some reviews say it isn't very durable, but I've been using mine for several months now without issue. It sits in the trunk of my car and I only bring it out when I'm using it.I imagine it's not built to withstand hours and hours of teaching lessons with everyday, but for the casual player it's more than fine.	20
First off this review is just about the loader, not the supplier. THIS THING WILL NOT FIT THE COLT 38 DET SPECIAL. It is too big to get lined up with the cylinder  because it is agenst the frame of the gun. It will only allow the tips of 4 out of six of the bullets to be placed in the cylinder then you have to relice the bullets and guide them in the rest of the way after you move the speed loader out of the way. DON'T BUY IT FOR THIS GUN.	20
"This is the ""10A"" HKS speedloader.  It is skinny enough that it will load my Dan Wesson 15-2 .357 with the Hogue grip.  Certain other six-shot speedloaders will not fit because there is not enough room between the edge of the speedloader and the side of the revolver for the cylinders to line up with the bullets.  I am imagining that this problem exists with certain smaller revolvers and grips.  This one works well with my Dan Wesson and still does a great job with larger revolvers such as my Ruger GP100.  Recommended.  RJB."	20
I have been cleaning firearms for over 40 years and have never had a better aid for doing it right than the Boresnake. I have an aversion to putting a firearm away without cleaning it if it's been fired, and sometimes it seems a bit of a bother. With this gadget, half the work is taken out of the equation, and with the proper lubes, brushes and an air compressor with a nozzle (my personal secret for getting grit and dust out of hard to reach places!) the rest of the job is easy.	20
A solid, wide-web belt with a plastic quick release buckle. There's ample length for ample waists, and the 25 shotshell loops do not take up the whole belt, so there's room for accessories, if you choose. I wear about a 34&#34;, and I can fit two magazine and one pistol holster comfortably alongside the shotshells. Construction quality is good. 12 ga shells are held very snugly. They are readily removed from a full belt; an empty one is pretty lightweight and requires just a bit more effort to get those last 2-6 shells out.	20
I was introduced to Dr. Bronner's organic peppermint soap by a very health conscious girlfriend in California, way back in 1979, and I've been a loyal fan ever since. The tingly peppermint feeling I get when showering with this stuff is like no other soap product I've ever used. Just put a couple of squirts on a facecloth for a ton of super-rich lather that serves as both shampoo and body wash. Very refreshing. I ALWAYS keep a couple of big bottles in reserve. I never want want to run out of Dr.Bronner's excellent product.	20
These work for their intended purpose. I carry them on the belt with my S&W 357. Others have said that they don't have the form that the leather does, but once they are loaded and put on the belt, a little cheap hair spray will stiffen them right up. Besides, loading the speed loaders and putting them in the pouches isn't exactly where time is a factor. What counts is when you drop the empty cartridges on the ground and reach for the speed loader that matters. In that fashion, the velcrow works just fine.	20
This stuff is the bomb. I use after cleaning my guns and putting them away. It leaves a protective oil on the gun which protects against rust. Your firearm will look like new after you use it. Also safe on polymer, plastic, and wood. One wipe will clean about 6-8 handguns or 2 rifles. My only complaint would be the price. Remington sells the same stuff in an aerosol spray which can be applied to a lint free cloth for a fraction of the cost.  But I also buy these wipes for portability and convince.	20
The first time I fed this thing through the barrel and started yanking on it, I really thought it was going to snap because it fit so tight.  But then I realized, if its not tight its not going to cleaning everything.  When out in the field, whether you are lazy or just did not bring all your cleaning gear, this BoreSnake and a small bottle of cleaning solution will get you through your day of shooting.  I will agree with the other reviewer that cleaning rods and patches do a better thorough job, however.	20
This holster fits my gun perfectly and clicks in place.  The paddle fits well, the clip is strong, the materials are good, there is a surface inside the paddle that is grips comfortably against the body. The only draw back is that it has two bumps along the waistline that poked into my side.  You can either tuck in your shirt or smash the bumps down.  I got a vice grip and just squeezed the crap out of them - and now it fits perfectly. Other than that minor tweak - I am super happy.	20
We have a 22 year old son who loves being barefoot, but that's not always practical due to weather. He really likes the lightness and comfortableness of these shoes for his general purpose wear (not martial arts). We buy about one new pair each year. His use is probably about 6 months of HEAVY walking (3-6 miles per day). These aren't designed for this, but they hold up pretty well. He basically just wears through the soles.So, these can be used for more that just martial arts. As comfortable and light footware, they work well.	20
I like to have this small one in my pocket for daily use.  It's small enough so it is less bulky than my car key and alarm bob.  It has the basic knife, combination screwdriver and nail file, and a small scissor; everything I've needed in a pinch when at work or out-and-about.  There's a pull out tweezer and toothpick, but I rarely use those.  Unfortunately, I had to give my last one to TSA at the airport.  I've gotten so used to slipping it into my pocket, it's hard to purposely not take it along.	20
This is my third Victorinox Swiss Army knife.  (I lost the first and still have the second.  I only bought this because I wanted more tools).  These knives are incredibly durable.  I've never had one fail me.  With some imagination, the tools can be used for many more things than their intended purpose.  They are also much smaller and lighter than a Leatherman or similar tool, which makes them convenient to have on you at all times.  They're perfect for those moments when an unexpected need arises and you don't have full size tools with you.	20
Being new to shooting using a scope I have found this one to be simple, rugged and easy to adjust . I have it on a Ruger American in 308 and once I used a little loc-tight  I have no worry about it moving .  My only complaint if you could even call it that was there were no scope rings included with the scope .  But with this set up shooting off a bench I have a .75 to 1 MOA rifle with the right ammo so for the price I can not complain .	20
I'm not lazy when it comes to cleaning guns. I'll do it the old fashioned way with brushes, patches, Hoppe's #9 and a rod if that's what it takes. But this is a great additional tool that does a lot of that in one pass. It's very sturdy and well made. The brush part is exceptional. Plus you can put some oil on the end and lightly lubricate your barrel at the same time. I cleaned a 12-guage in no time with some foaming bore cleaner, a dab of CLP and this. Easy as can be.	20
WITH THE HELP OF SOME ON LINERS THEY HELP ME PICK THIS BRAND OF TOUCH UP GUN PASTE AND THE COLOR WAS WRIGHT ON THE MONEY, IT CAME OUT JUST LIKE THEY SAID, NOT A BLACK SHINEY  FINISH  BUT A REAL NICE FLAT BLACK MATTE FINISH, IT COVERD THE MARKS ON THE BARREL SO WELL THAT I DIDN'T EVEN HAVE TO DO THE WHOLE RIFLE. GREAT PRODUCT, THE ONLY THING THAT HURTS WAS THE SHIPPING, BUT IT WAS WORTH IT SO I DON'T MIND PAYING EXTRA FOR SOME THING THAT WORKS GOOD !. SIGNED :  DETZY	20
This shell belt is one good belt. holds the shells in place they are not coming out. i had no problems putting in the 25 shells was pretty easy. The belt is a strong stiff nylon belt. The only minor thing which is minor is the slack left over if your an average size guy 38inch waist or smaller. either cut the slack or like i did zip tied the slack. I use it for when i do outside shooting i have extra shells on me and i don't have to walk back to the table.	20
I bought the purple one to add to my Strong Man Set of 6 to make it a Super Strong Man Set of 7. This is one tough band. Great for high intensity bicep curls and door anchor exercises, such as back rows and standing chest press. But too difficult for tricep kick backs. It came with a door anchor and an instruction pamphlet. There's no BMP logo on either handle just like their orange band. Overall I'm glad Black Mountain is going the direction of making their systems better and stronger. Keep up the good work.	20
I can't stress enough how well these thermos koozies work. I own a can-am Maverick UTV and the cup holders in that thing will boil your drink in 5 minutes. Using these koozies I can set a drink in the cup holder inside this koozie and it will keep it nice and cold for a long time. Well worth the money! The only problem I had was that the bottom plastic piece fell off when I dropped it about 6 ' onto concrete, I just put some epoxy on it and it is as good as new.	20
Have six of the Ugly Sticks. They about the best rod you cam buy for the money.  Have a couple over 15 years old.  Although the finish is about gone on them they still get the fish in the boat.  The tip is a tad soft for long distance casting but they work just fine for most situations.. They are sensitive with a good backbone and hold up to abuse.  Don't care much for the reel holders on the newer rods.  But, haven't lost a reel yet.Would recommend if you want a decent rod for little money.	20
"I bought three.Don't be fooled into buying a cheaper product that includes plastic coated chains and hooks- they are crap and will last 6 months.  This swing is of a build quality you'll find at the finest outdoor park.  Swing seat is THICK 6"" black rubber attached to heady duty welded triangles riveted solidly to the swing seat.  After 8 months outdoors with heavy use (several birthday parties, multiple kids/adults at a time etc), these show no noticeable sign of wear or quitting.Buy these, and you can expect your grand-kids to be swinging from them one day."	20
My wingmaster's barrel has never been cleaner. Just put a little bit of oil around the diameter towards the end, and pull it through 2-3 times and you are DONE. Fast, cheap, and effective. Can't ask for more. I have one in .22 that was much harder to pull through the first time, but the 12 gauge one wasn't bad at all. I will keep buying these as I acquire new calibers.They also wash when dirty, just a little bit of soap and some hot water, then let them air dry and you are good to go.	20
I thought I would try this item instead of a normal brass Hoppe's brush and here's my results.  The brush was very tight even with the Hoppe's fluid on it, it was very tough to push through a S&W m&p 15-22 bore. I planned on using this on a .223 chrome lined bore but will not attempt it because it was so tight. It did seem to clean fine and probably was a little quicker vs. the standard brass brush. Overall I wasn't too impressed and will stick with the normal and cheaper brass brushes from Hoppe's.	20
I have used Tru-Oil on about 15 different projects (all firearm related).I have used this mostly over min-wax stains as a sealer.Use light coats it goes a long way.  I let my coats dry 24hrs between applications and use a 0000 steel wool lightly between coats.So far all the projects I have done with Tru-Oil over the years have held up great.  It isn't too hard to strip if you want to take it off (mineral spirits) and you can always touch up by knocking the top coat down with some steel wool and applying new coats.	20
"Its not a $30+ dollar belt,but for the price,you won't be disappointed.Shells go in tight,but that's the way I would expect a new shell belt to be.Leaving the shells in the belt for an extended period should loosen the holders somewhat.Lots of extra belt material left over after adjustment on my 36"" waist.I cut it off and melted the ends with a flame.This left over material will make a nice sheath for my survival knife.Waste not,want not.I got mine from OutdoorBunker and it arrived quickly and was packaged perfectly,with FREE shipping at that.Great item,thanks much O.B.and Amazon!"	20
After a traumatic experience with my old knife (also Swiss Army) that involved an impossible to open wine bottle, I was in need of a new knife.  I searched and searched with the following requirements.  It had to have both a small and large blade.  It needed a phillips and flat screwdriver.  It also needed the punch, toothpick, and tweezers.  I found what I needed in the tinker.  Its two blades wide, and the length in the description is accurate, no extra bulges in my pocket.  I can easily say that i use it 4-5 times a day.	20
I complained when I saw only 2 pads but upon closer look, they were not the same size. So doing some actually thinking, I took the package apart and lo and behold, there were 4 nested in two pairs. They are small but should fit up to a typical 12 year old. Quality is only OK, but a good deal for the price. They are not real comfortable as I would have expected with gel pads, but fit is OK. I suspect they will chafe with long wear, but I expect they will be fine for my requirements.	20
I was given one of these trailers by my son and daughter-in-law this past Christmas. Our grandson is now old enough so I took him for a little ride yesterday, he loved it!Yes, I'm sure you can spend a lot more money and get a better one, but this works just fine. Easy to put together, easy to attach to my bike (I attached it to an old mtn bike instead of my road bike)attaches very easy and seems very secure.Pulls easily enough and holds Will in place ... what more can you ask for for this price?	20
Ended up returning it and getting the Becker bk7 but it's really just personal preference vs any major flaws with this knife.  It is a whole different type of tool.  The Becker is massive, burly, tough, heavy duty and heavy.  The SOG is light, nimble, and low profile with a much smaller and thinner blade.  I just didn't care for the feel of it in my hand and I don't think it would make a good survivalist knife compared to the becker.  It's too fragile for chopping and hacking and prying.  Nice knife, just not what I needed.	20
As a rule I prefer the type of cast iron pan that has a machined cooking surface. I have managed to find a number of these but cannot locate new ones and do not have this griddle with a machined surface. That is my only gripe with the Lodge brand. However, this round griddle has worked very nicely. I have had to re season the cooking surface but it was my fault. The grill does maintain that nice slick seasoned surface that cast iron cookware is noted for. This type of pan is great for omelets and pancakes.	20
After looking around and by reading other reviews I established that the HKS 36-A is the one for my 5-shooter Ruger SP-101Amazon copies the description that HKS has and those descriptions needs some major review and corrections.- like showing and saying it is a 6-shot speedloader, when the SP-101 is a five shot gun!It feels a little chintzy (that;s why the 4 stars) but it works. I tried it many times by now and I can work it without any problems with my SP-101 (with original grips - I hear/read that the Hogue grips get in the way).	20
I purchased this set of hangers to display an antique rifle in my office.  The installation was easy into a wood panelled wall.  I think installation into drywall would require special fasteners which do not come with the hangers.  The finish looks to be polished brass but not polished to a mirror finish.  They are thick material and very strong so that if they are fastened to the wall securely they should be able to hold significant weight.These hangers are attractive but do not overwhelm the object being displayed.  All in all, I'm quite satisfied with this purchase.	20
fits almost all my firearms in one way or another (from one side or the other). easy to set combos great quality good solid feel and fit. much safer then keys that can be lost. i keep some of my firearms at my mothers house and now she can feel safe and still have access to them when needed. i have them on almost all my firearms. not cheap but nothing thats worth buying is. buy more then one and the shipping is worth it as the shipping is a flat rate for anything from one item to 100.	20
"For kids who aren't old enough to handle a skateboard, but still want to be out rolling along with the neighborhood kids, this is your answer.  The `Razor A Kick Scooter' is perfect for those 5 and older.  Made of aircraft-grade aluminum, with 4"" heavy-duty urethane wheels, adjustable comfortable handlebars, and a patented rear fender brake, this little scooter will make any youngster mobile and happy.  It comes in several colors and folds up into a six-pound storable package.  Scooters are almost an American tradition and kids love the feel of freedom when playing around the neighborhood or playground."	20
I suppose for the price these are good shorts but the problem I have with them is the seam for the chamois. It's just a normal seam with the threading exposed which can rub you the wrong way if not careful. I tend to do 10-20+ mile rides. If you're just cruising a few miles around town, these should work fine. But if you're doing distance, look elsewhere. I also have a pair of pearl izumi shorts which are expensive, but the stitching is hidden under the chamois instead of these shorts which have it going around the perimeter.	20
I was looking for an electric knife to make slicing my round loaves of bread easier. Unfortunately, the crust on my loaf was barely being cut by the sawing action of the blades.Maybe I was using it incorrectly. The blades sawed back quickly and smoothly, but regardless of the amount of downward pressure I applied, the action did not slice my bread.It was also much larger than I expected it to be.  I did not try cutting anything else with it, since I only needed it to cut bread.  And I did not try cutting a softer sandwich loaf.	20
pushers, get out there and make some moneyeasy to put together.  nice look.  Of course the stand never really works and will just get knocked down on the court the minute you try to set it up, but I already expected that.Nice looking, professional look.  Wilson impresses the kids.  Black is sleek.One thing.  I noticed that the bolts have a tendency to get loose over time and will fall off on the court if you are not careful and don't check every once in a while to make sure they are secure.  Otherwise, for $20 bucks with shipping, perfect.	20
These bore snakes are much easier to use and cause much less damage to the barrel than your traditional push rod and brush. I find that I can spray in, or simply add a few drops of, bore cleaner into the barrel and allow it to soak in for a few minutes and then just pull this through a few times and the bore is clean.  An extra wet patch sometimes if I have gone a few days from when I last shot the gun. I have them in multiple calibers and they all seem to work equally well.	20
When I started shooting at targets for more than a hundred yards to test the grouping of your rifle, this I found to be the best target to use.Depending on color of the foliage backdrop where you set up your target, time of day and level of dust and wind going around, some paper target hits get too hard to see from distance greater than 100 yards even with the spotting scope. These targets are awesome with the black on bright green. The hits are really clear but they don't bust out to wide to skew your grouping assessment.	20
This float was purchased to be a 'floating cover' as required by central Texas laws in regards to having 25% of your pool covered.  This float does not stay in the pool on even mildly windy days so I do not recommend it for that purpose.  Additionally I got the orange one which faded within the first week and now after a few more weeks looks absolutely pitiful.I have to put air into it every couple of weeks too.The kids do enjoy this one a lot because it allows their body's to dip into the water while relaxing on it.	20
This is a really nice pocket knife, hurry and get one before you come down with scurvy!The next time I buy some oranges I'm going to try out this orange peeler blade.The file is nice and the scissors are noticeably better than on the 58mm (smallest) SAKs, and those scissors aren't even all that bad.I think that this may be one of the best compromises in size vs utility - it is very easy to pocket but comes with some nice tools.It is also not a bad choice to pair with a SAK or multi-tool that doesn't come with scissors.	20
"My daughter said ""the grip wasn't the best, and it didn't bounce as well as other balls she has had in the past"". She is only ten years old but she loves basketball and the ball was for her so I thought you should hear her point of view. The ball has been serviceable and is very good for the price.  I must also say that it has taken a beating with all my children and the neighbors children as well giving it a torture treatment every day , yet it still bounces and it still is in one piece."	20
"Back in 2005 when i bought my 1st Bicycle i also got this light combo(Whereas my front light was gray in hue,unlike the black/gray one you see here)thinking it was a good buy,wrong!This product is as shoddy as most ""BEll products"" are.The rear light went out first,then the front light shorted out after a minor drop.Later after having my bicycle stolen while using a Bell bike lock i've learned not to trust the viability of ""Bell products"" ever again.That's why i'm now a ""Cateye's"" and ""Nite Ize"" product fan.Learn from my mistake and avoid buying this product at all cost."	20
As several other reviews have said - definitely a good idea - Of the various accessories for the DW708, the one I think should have been included with the saw (or at least priced more reasonably). If it was...I'd give it 5 stars.  Sturdy construction, particularly considering it's an offshore-built product. It is a bit wobbly until you clamp it down on the workpiece, but that's forgiven due to the ease of removal (for switching sides, removing for steep beveling, etc).	21
You just bought the best screwdriver possible. The Milwaukee. That is why you are looking at this offset. Well, the screwdriver's handle offsets. A little. But, that just gives you something to hold against when the torque starts. But now to get into the tight spots. Think about it, we've all been there..... This is built like a Milwaukee too, after being thought out like a Milwaukee. It fits in the carry case for the Milwaukee. You Need One, Right?  Right.	21
The title of this review says it all.  These blades have a separate set of teeth that cut each side of the kerf.  You can actually end up with cuts that don't need sanding!  These cut through everything I have tried them on  like butter.  They are particularly good on plywood.I use them in my  Bosch Jigsaw (see that review, also).  I suppose they will fit other brands  that have a bayonet mount.If you find a smoother cutting blade, let me  know!	21
Titebond I, II or III?  You want this one.  Plenty of time to apply and then clamp &#34;work time&#34; but still has enough tack for set-up.  It's water resistant where Titebond I is not.  If you need water-proof, get Titebond III, but it's a lot more expensive.  Just remember to use a wet cloth to remove any 'squeeze-out' after you clamp.  Sanding off glue residue is time consuming and frustrating.  There is nothing better on the market to glue wood than Titebond II.	21
Because of its size, this clamp does have some limitations; it cannot hold a great deal of weight or generate great amounts of pressure.  For small projects like miniature boxes, frames or models, it is ideal.  I use mine  for all of the above and on my N-Guage railroad layout.The one-hand  tightening and loosening mechanism is easy to master and is the same as  larger Quick-grip bar clamps.  If you scale your project to your tools, you  will have no problems with these.	21
I tried a leather holster for my Dewalt cordless, but was unimpressed.  Maybe I just needed to break in the leather, but I really had to force the  drill in the holster and make sure the strap was closed.  Otherwise, the  drill would tip out.The bigg lugg is great.  It clips on your belt or  waistband, and holds the drill excellently.  It also swivels to the side  and out of the way when not in use.  A very nice addition to the toolbox.	21
so it holds the bit.  My last collet got scratched or bent or something.  It wouldn't grip correctly and the bit would work its way up and down while cutting.  Aside from a bad cut it was dangerous.  This one does what the other used to do.  It holds the bit like it is supposed to.  Plus I like the retaining ring to hold the nut to the collet.  Makes it easier to change the collet size all at once, no finding parts and such.	21
This finish sander just isn't up to Makita's standards.  It works well when new, but lacks durability.  Even in a non-professional setting, it just doesn't last.  The clamps that hold the paper can work loose and are a major pain to get back in place.  The level of vibration will also increase in fairly short order.  It does sand well, I just wish it was more solidly built.  If you need a solid finish sander, you're better off looking at the Porter-Cable or Dewalt models.	21
This will organize your tools in one spot for easy access.  The material is strong, durable and wear resistant.  The pockets are generous and allow you to find a home for just about any tool.  The bucket interior allows storage for over-sized tools and supplies.  I use this for a mobile set of tools when making home repairs away from my home.  It's a great idea and it works really well.  Buy the organizer top to store small items and you have a mobile tool &#34;System.&#34;	21
Although I had to drill holes to fit my Craftsman drill press, the basic setup was reasonably easy.  The result was a very sturdy little stand -- perfect for many bench top tools.  Its weight and construction make for a very stable base.  Comparing it to, for example, a similar stand (sold by the same store from which I bought the drill press,) there is simply no comparison to be made.  This Delta stand is far superior.  I will probably buy another soon for my bench grinder.	21
I have owned this dado set for 8 or 9 years.  It has never cut very well, leaving rough bottoms with a lot of chip out.  It got to the point that I used my router or router table for most dado operations, avoiding the Freud dado set altogether.  I have owned other Freud blades for my table, miter, and skil saw.  These blades have done a good job at a reasonable price, but this dado set has been very disappointing.  I would not buy recommend it.	21
The Big Horn 19119 All In One Glue Spreader Kit has everything you need to glue a variety of projects, well, almost everything, you do have to buy the glue! Another reviewer said he would buy the kit just for the roller but I need to glue using a variety of applications so, I find the total kit very useful. Works with all types, Silicone Metal Glue And Seal,Franklin International Titebond II Premium Wood Glue, Carpenter Interior Wood Glue-4oz,Gorilla Glue Adhesive. I like it! ~ The Boss	21
This glue seems to be a staple amongst professional woodworkers.  I like the bottle design, which squirts the glue in a more controlled fashion and is easier to clean.  Here is my summary of pluses and minuses:1.  This  glue is very strong.2.  The glue sets very quickly, so you have less  working time.3.  If you get a lot of squeeze-out, it's difficult to  clean the glue off the wood.  Heavy sanding is necessary to remove traces  of the glue.But if you are careful, this glue pays off.	21
"Used with brad point bits it works well and with no hassles.  Seems to center pretty accurately and comes with some dowels to get you started.  The lines/marks for placing the hole are not going to be flush with the surface of your wood (unless its 1/2"" thick) so there is a little room for error there.  Most of the other jigs I've seen are the same way though and you can work around that by running a line across the end of the wood as well."	21
"I got these blades to use in a ""Rockwell Bladerunner"" saw.  They fit nice, cut good, and are a decent price.  They don't seem to be able to handle quite as tight of radius as the blade that came with the Rockwell for scrolling without the piece vibrating.  These blades are a little shorter than the blades that came with the Bladerunner but work fine for my needs.  If you are wanting to cut a thicker piece of wood you might want to get a slightly longer blade."	21
This is by far the best router that I have used, and I've used them all! It is incredibly powerful, quiet, well designed, easy to handle, and light. The soft start feature is a huge plus. The variable speed is very helpful. Heck of a deal for the money.I use this tool with the Bosch Deluxe edge guide to make trim and moulding. No question this is professional level tool that great for homeowner and contrator.I love this thing!  I have yet to find something I don't like.	21
I already owned ten such clamps when I ordered these.  Only two of the others are Irwin Quick-Grips, and the others are somewhat lower in quality.  I believe this brand is the very best, and it really is like having a helper right beside you.  One hand is all it takes to apply the clamp, loosen it if necessary for re-adjustment, or remove it.  And although this is called a mini-clamp, it is of a size that makes it perfect for countless uses around the house or shop.	21
Packs of blades like this are very useful if you are new to reciprocating saws. You can try a wide variety of blades without spending a lot of jack. Then when you decide which ones  work for what you need you just replace  those blades. I don't personally buy multi blade packs except when I get a  new saw and they come with it. But if you don't really know what kind of  blades you like, try one of these. You can learn a lot with one project.	21
I bought one of the $124 PL200 Stair Wizard that the factory was selling becasue of blemishes.  Well, I got it and used it on a stair job this week and I cannot find a blemish and the tool worked perfectly.Don't miss out on this deal or else you'll pay full price.  This is a needed tool if you're going to do stairs as part of your job.Not just for treads on enclosed stairways, but it'll do risers and even angled treads.  Other makes aren't as versatile.Dave M	21
I've used this for about six months now.  For the price I am satisfied. But you get what you pay for. It required at least an hour to true the sole, clean the paint from certain areas and sharpen the blade. And the blade doesn't seem to hold an edge for a long time. I think I'll ask Santa to put a Lie Neilsen in my stocking this year. For the weekend warrior, this is probably the perfect plane. But beware, the blade needs to be sharpened before use.	21
There are a couple complaints from people saying how the glue didn't work on some other materials... like stone or ceramic.  That's not what this stuff is for... it's for wood.  Use it on wood, it'll do well. Very well.The wood needs to be mildly moist, as this stuff reacts to moisture.  The wood needs to be clamped, as this stuff expands.  It's polyurethane foam, for the most part.  I haven't found another commercially available wood glue that works half as well as this does for it's intended purpose.	21
I've never used a blade stiffener in all the years of using other blade brands such as Freud. It's recommended with the WWII blades, so I bought one last year.It boils down to this, a Woodworker II blade along with this stiffener makes the best cuts I ever done in my life. The blade is quieter, vibration free, smooth and slices through sheet goods like butter. I use this combo on my Bosch 4100 table saw and wouldn't change a thing.Currently building mudroom cabinetry and next office built-in shelves.	21
I work construction and do plenty of research on tools. Skil currently makes less then par products, but with this exception. This saw is the industry standard. I see the MAG77 and the regular HD77 on every construction site. I like the HD77 because it is a little smoother then the MAG77 due to the heavier steel casing, which means no kickback and a stonger, more solid feel. Both saws are incredible and either purchase is an investment. Buy this saw if you plan on cutting a lot of lumber.	21
I own a Porter-Cable 15 amp (which I love) and one of these.  I've had the P-C over a year and this Skil, which I just got a couple days ago, blows the Porter Cable away!  I'm not a contractor, but I understand fully why contractors out West love them.  This is one beefy machine with tons of power to cut anything.  I tried twisting it in a cut to test it and it only slowed a little, while the P-C nearly stops!  A great buy for DIY-er or professional.	21
This ended up doing what I wanted but not as slickly as I hoped for.  The description didn't give me a complete picture of how this would work.  I had hoped it would slip over or into the 4&#34; exhaust on my bandsaw, it didn't.  It also is 4&#34; so I cut it down to about 3/4&#34; lenghth and duct taped it to the bandsaw.  My 2 1/2&#34; shopvac hose fits perfectly on the other end.  I'm happy with this arrangment since it kept the price down for the modification.	21
Ordered a set of these based on the almost unanimous 5 star reviews.  Packages came with the dreaded &#34;Made in China&#34; sticker applied to the box.  Sure enough, all 4 were mis-welded so badly that they would not fit a 2x4 into the top.  Every single one had the top bracket at all sorts of random angles so they were nowhere near parallel.  One had a gap of &#60;1&#34; where you insert the 2x4.No quality control.  Another quality brand down.  If someone knows of a good alternative, please post it.	21
I got this kit and it took me 15 minutes to disassemble, install and reassemble my Ridgid saw. Literally. I don't know why others have had such a hard time. The wrenching is tricky and you need a big one, but c'mon now!For my saw this was an EXACT match (the Ridgid branded one was $150! What???)If you are not mechanical or not very strong, you'll need help, but if you are... Just get it!I got another for the Jet saw at my company's shop and it unsurprisingly worked perfectly.Completely recommended.	21
I must have a different machine from the other reviewers or maybe I need less hand holding. The one I have is easy to set and accurate. In fact, it seem to be identical to the Lamello in design. The fence can be set crooked if you try but turning the handle to lock it pulls it in to parallel. For dust collection a shop vac is best but the bag does a fair job. I highly recommend this tool for those that want a machine like Lamello's without spending $400.	21
This is a standard push stick, of relitively heavy plastic.  Not to be confused with the modern versions engineered for use by woodworkers who are convinced they don't ever want their hobby to bite.  I once owned a shopsmith saw, it came with a couple of push pads and a push stick similar to this one.  I just wanted another like it for no apparent reason to speak of.  I just wanted one like the other one that married dear old dad. What?  Then you come up with your own reason.	21
Once a person uses this to wrap their cord, they'll wonder why they didn't have it sooner. This holds a 100' 12 gauge cord with ease. The cord does need to be wrapped like wire, tight and coiled. I have it so my tool plugs into the bucket. Rebar fits into the holes at the base, so if need be, I stake it where I need to use it and pull the cord towards the power source. If I need to uncoil more cord, simply unplug the tool and move the bucket.	21
This sander is very high quaility, and will last for years. It is very powerful, you can sand anything in about 1/2 time compared to a normal belt sander, because you can put so much pressure on it. It works great and the  dust bag is great, it holds alot of dust and has yet to rip. The sander is  also very stable, ive used it for hours with no fatigue. the speed is also  very easy to adjust, just with a simple flick of your thumb. I highly  reccomend this belt sander.	21
Milwaukee, again, has produced a superior product.  The tool is very handy and really does work in tight quarters, although I use it for a lot of different applications.  The trigger is one of the best I have used for controlling the speed of the drill.  It gives you a feel for the speed and is very precise.  It fits in your and perfectly and has never bogged down.  Ever.  It is a litle pricey but it's a drill that is used a lot.  In no way is it limited to tight quarters.	21
"I purchased a used one for a song on ebay with a few parts missing and a few contractor modifications (a nice way of saying paint splatters, missing parts and a nail being used as the safety button). I was delighted to see that the saw still cut like a champ with a new blade put on it and that parts were easy to find and buy online! The saw is accurate, it has to be the best 10"" CSMS on the market! Get one new, get one used -- but get one!"	21
My brother introduced me to Forrest Blades.  I bought one at a wood show and tried it.  I just could not believe the results.  Wonderful!  It put new life in my radial 9&quot; Sears saw.  The cuts were effortless and smooth as glass.  With this underpowered saw that used to bog down in simple 2 x 4s, I can cut anything with ease.  I was impressed enough to buy two more for my other bench saws.  That demonstrates it all when these cost the big bucks.  But these blades are worth every penny!	21
I used this blade for cutting pine but It did not impressed me at all. I found my Freud industrial blade ( combination ) giving more clean cuts on pine.I guess most of the reviews were for cutting pine, but most woodworkers don't use pine as it is weak / soft wood.After using this blade for one project with pine and Redwood, I did not felt the price was worth it. Nothing impressive at all..Save your money and get Freud combination at less than half the price or go for Oldham combination blade.	21
Very poorly constructed.  Flimsy sheet metal.  Catches on the underside of the jaws do not engage securely into the holes in the frame.  Adjusting screws were poorly aligned so that the first attachment of the moveable jaw left it crooked and required some disassembly and adjusting on my part.  Reasonably sturdy with all 4 legs on a flat floor, but I suspect it will prove wobbly on an uneven surface.  Definitely not for the serious DIYer who works with heavier items.  Next time I would look for something much sturdier.  Made in China.	21
Top Quality tool! Made very well, works like a charm. This is a precision tool so you'll want to find a safe place to store it and not toss it in your toolbox. We all know that there are very few true 90 degree corners, but you'll be surprised just how far off many corners really are. This tool brings a new level of accuracy to your work and it shows in the finished product. Don't know how I got along without one for so long. I feel it's well worth the price.	21
I hate it when my shirt collars, not otherwise secured in place by buttons, end up in weird places throughout the day. I purchased some steel collar stays to use with these magnets but they were only vaguely magnetic. I ended up using 2 of these magnets - one in the collar with the stay and the other inside my shirt, to lock my collar in place. They work flawlessly. They are the perfect size, and there are plenty of magnets in case you forget to remove them at the end of the day.	21
Not packed badly, but the product arrived scratched in numerous places and dented in a few areas. I decided to keep it and just painted over the scratches with black spraypaint and then coated it all over with a high gloss protectant. There is no way a product should be shipped looking like this one did. It was obvious that it was already damaged before it was packed and mailed! The stand seems sturdy enough, but I am still waiting on the saw to arrive to check fitment and utility.  Also, MADE IN CHINA.	21
This is the third finishing sander I've owned (I got it free when I bought my compound miter saw) and of the three its the best in terms of sanding quality and noise.  However, I'd go with a random orbit sander to get better quality.My biggest complaint is that the dust attachment (DW4111) comes separately (and is not carried by very many suppliers, including Amazon).  The dust bag that comes with their random orbit sander pulls apart and fits a standard 2 1/2 inch dust hose.  Why couldn't they do that with this one?	21
Was going to just build my own originally but for the price I figured I would save myself some time and buy this with the saw.  Glad I did.  Well built and works very well (can't say the same for the extension table that came with the saw). For the time I would have spent making my own it would not have been worth it.  Use this every time i use the saw.  I very rarely collapse the table down but when I do, it collapses easily and always returns to the same position.	21
Bought this router with the idea of using it in a table exclusively. I Figured it would be too heavy for using it without a table, but I was wrong: the smooth slowstart feature and the router having no vibration makes it easily controlled.I did end up mounting it in a table and it works great with large style and rail cutters.I compared this against the larger DeWalt, but this one won based on price. As to performance, they are probably equal.If you need a larger router for a good price, get this one.	21
I have bought may different grits of the Mirka sanding disks for my orbital hook and loop sander and I must say that these are the toughest and most long lasting ones I have ever used. I had always purchased other brand name disks so these were the first Mirkas I had ever used. Believe me, there is NO comparisons between the other brands I have used and Mirka's.  If you can find a supplier who offers better longer lasting sanding disks, I would love to know their name and where to get them.	21
"Small and looks flimsy. However, this router table is very impressive. Fence is sturdy and is as much flat as 0.002"". Table is also super flat and does not bend even when 50 Lb board is sliding over it. I integrated this table within large homemade one, bought Woodpecker's router lift and now long and wide boards can be routed easily and accurate.Finally, this table obviously will not match Incra systems; but it is good enough for literally every type of routing, except generation of complicated joints such as box, dovetail and so on."	21
I bought this Bosch at the beginning of a major remodeling project to replace a tired, 30 year old ... sander. I haven't been disappointed.For two years I fnished molding, leveled countertops, stripped old paint, sanded out difficult flooring stains and bevelled edges with it, and it's still running like new. It's light enough to use all day, the belts never need adjusting or wander off, and the variable speed feature makes it easy to set it for the job at hand. And the dustcatcher really works. An excellent choice for the pro or handyman.	21
After years of cheap drills, I finally decided to try a nice one.  Wow!  Not only does this drill do everything I need a 3/8 drill to do, it is so smooth that it is a pleasure to operate, even after two years.  The keyless chuck has never slipped; the motor will stall first (but only on ridiculously long drill bits designed for a larger drill).  There's no turning back.  I wish I would have bought tools like this years ago.  They are actually a better value, after you have smoked a few cheaper tools.	21
"I just built a 650 sq ft deck with this bad boy. I already know its great for trim but cutting a 1"" X 6"" on a 45 degree angle was when i needed a slider. it made probably close to 500 cuts in Ipe lumber which we know is some hard wood. Oddly enough the dust colector worked pretty well also which is not something you see everyday on a slider.Highly recommend12/5/2006 - Update - I just added the IRWIN 3061001 Miter Saw Laser Guide. fits perfect. Read my review of that product also."	21
I rate this half-a-star simply because it was a 'set' as advertised.  That is the only thing the manufacturer/distributor got right.  The push block and the stick can be made at home for cents.  The featherboard mounting system is a total failure.  There is no way you can lock the featherboard to the table slot and have it be a reliable, working accessory. I'm amazed this set is still offered for sale.  In my opinion, the loose and unreliable featherboard is quite possiblly an accident waiting to happen.  Not mine.  It is at the landfill.	21
If you want to install cabinets without a helper then you definitely need this set of clamps.I installed a set of five upper cabinets I made without a helper. The line between adjacent cabinets is barely noticeable. I give the product 5 stars because it does exactly what it is suppose to do. I cannot comment on how long the clamps will last, but for me it does not matter because I do not install cabinets for a living. I assume that plastic will break eventually if you use the clamps on a daily basis.	21
"Only comes with router bit for 1/4"" radius hinges which are virtually non-existent. Almost all hinges today are 5/8"" radius. The 5/8"" bit is impossible to find even on line, and as another reviewer noted, the manufacturer has no intent of making the bit available with 1/4"" shaft. So, tool is basically useless unless you happen to be installing 1/4"" radius hinges. Shipping back to Amazon. Guess I'll revert to hammer and chisel. Makes me wonder what genius at the manufacturer (DC Precision Tools) is making the decisions (so much for buying ""Made in USA"")."	21
I did a lot of research and many people complained about &#34;the tolerances&#34; or the machines being &#34;off&#34; by a micro millimeter.  Here is my experience: I'm a dowel guy, but i recently purchased this tool to speed things up that don't need the strength of a dowel.  I'm quite happy with it.  There are some big advantages in assembly of cabinetry to have a plate jointer!  When you place a biscuit, you have a little play to work with so even if the machine were 'off' by a millimiter, it's really no issue at all.	21
I accidentally ordered the wrong size adapter, but did not realize it until after it was shipped. I figure oh well it is only $5, write it off. Then I checked into how easy would it be to return it, being I never had to return anything back to Amazon before, I figured this would be a good trial run. But Amazon was having none of that, they told me to keep the part and they will refund my card anyway. Now thats is customer service.. Thanks Amazon for fixing my mistake for me, so easily.	21
I purchased four of the gates to use on my collection system.  They are very easy to use and install. The only thing that I wish that they had was a stop built into them to keep them open when in use in the vertical position.  I had purchased a competitor's gate to finish the system that had this stop in them and it really helps to be able to mount the gate vertically and not horizontally to help keep it open. All in all, it is a great item and recommend it's use to anyone.	21
ordered one some time ago, and just ordered another. I used one for a first aid kit. the other for my leather working tools and gear, this bag holds a lot! well built and sturdy. the side pockets are very large. holds 2 large storage bins 14&#34; x 9&#34; x 2&#34; deep and has room for tools.down side- the bottom isn't very thick, so it doesn't hold up well with a lot of very heavy tools. tends to bulge and fold.if you need a bag with lots of room for mid weight tools this is it!	21
The nice thing about the Bessey Tradesmen's is that they are heavier duty than the competition, in the medium duty class, and you don't have to take out a second mortgage to afford a set of them. The locking mechanism works without any hassles, and the grip is strong. All in all a nice piece of equipment. A major competitor sells this model for less money, but it is also a lighter weight clamp. I like them all. Bessey makes great stuff, you can't go wrong with these. They are a great general-purpose clamp. Highly recommended.	21
This is a fine quality tool that's not afraid to work hard or get dirty.During a recent roofing job while installing some flashing. I used my grinder with a masonry blade to slot the chimney. It worked flawlessly.With it's small size and 3 position handle you can really get into some tight spots.Add the switch lock and the spindle lock and you've got a real winner.My yellow grinder is now orange from the brick dust but,it's not complaining.I do recommend this tool it's works as hard as you do. Now get out there and grind away.	21
Great product. Very accurate and easy to set up. If you use the supplied plastic shims, you can even use it to mortise the lockset plate, as long as you only do one half at a time and then flip it around to do the other half. In the past I had used the plastic Porter-Cable template -- which was terribly frustrating to line up properly, and had to be nailed in place! The Hinge-Mate has clamps, though I recommend attaching some self-stick felt backing to the clamps to avoid marring the door surface. Highly recommended!	21
I saw this advertised in a tool catalog ten years ago.  I kept thinking I should buy that, it is a good idea, I hang a lot of doors, and that would save time and make my radius jig cuts clean right up.  I remember the torment I felt when I would cut a corner off square, too vain to fill it, I made painters come behind me and make me look good.  Not any more... I am now perfect with my perfect corner maker. Buy it now don't wait the ten tormentuous years I did.	21
Like some of the other reviews, this air hose does what it's intended to do - bring air from a compressor to a tool - with no problems. The problems arise when the air hose is subject to cooler weather. This hose is difficult to coil in warm weather - FORGET ABOUT trying to coil it when it's cold out - unless you really want to fight with it for way longer than any working man would want to. I'll keep it as an extension when needed, but I'm done fighting it; I'm switching to rubber.	21
I am a remodeler. I am not committed to any brand of tools, Some brands do better on one tool, and some do better on another. Overall Milwaukee is the brand I use the most, but a drywall screwgun I went with DeWalt. I have no complaints with this gun. It is fast, powerful, light, and has easy depth adjustment. I have been using it for the last year+ and havent had any problems with it.If you have drywall to do, and you dont have a drywall gun you are wasting time. It is worth the money.	21
"I like this plate jointer.  I have about 500 biscuits cut with this now, and I am happy with it.  It's not made like a fine swiss watch by any means, but it does work well for me if I take a little care setting it up, it performs as expected.  You have to be a little gentle with setting up the depth ""fence"", but it lines right up if you use reasonable care.  So far no problems that would change my satisfaction with buying it. I run a lot of makita tools and love them all"	21
It's hard to say anything that hasn't already been said, except that the author of the single negative comment obviously never used the MS-2000 stand.It rolls easily over rough ground, sets up in seconds, knocks down almost as fast, provides solid support for lumber and cutoffs.Mounting bolts for the DeWalt miter saw are a wee bit tight between the frame members.  I liked the suggestion here to cut a new, deeper MDF top to allow the saw to straddle the rear frame member and provide more wing support in front of the saw's fence for wider material.	21
No wait, that was my Stanely.  Come on, these speed square are the best!! Regardless of the price, this speed square is the best one you could buy.  For under 10 bucks this is a steal.  The Swanson Speed Square is a must in the tool belt and tool box.  I ran this thing over numerous times with a Bobcat, left it outside, hit it with a hammer, and it remains unphased.  Do not even try another brand.  It is a huge help when roofing, cutting lumber, framing, etc.If you need a speed square BUY THIS ONE!	21
I bought this light for my wife not myself.  She has a hard time sleeping when any lights are on (all in her head I think but I can't convince her of that).  I like to read in bed but I often come to bed later and this little light lets her sleep and lets me read.Brightness is good, I think they could use even a dimmer setting though.  Clip holds to books just fine.Also, this light is good for the kids in the back of the vehicle at night when they want to read on long trips.Recommended.	21
When I first used this blade I expected perfection and was not disappointed.  I also have a Forest Woodworker II, and it too is as good as it gets.  As the old woodworking axiom states; always buy the best tool you can afford.  I have worked my way up the ladder of being able to afford better and usually more expensive tools to the point where I can now buy the best.  That's not to say that there are not several other very good blades out there, there are.  But Forest is in a whole different zip code.	21
The light went out on my goose neck halogen music stand clip-on light. Looked at local brick outlets and thought replacement bulbs seemed costly. Checked Amazon and found this pack for what was being asked for 1 bulb. Wanted a replacement and a spare. Got that pair and 4 more pairs in just a couple of days which was before my nest public performance. Put in the replacement and saw the light!Placed extras in strategic locations for my next emergency blackout when I would have forgotten where I put my spare bulb.MORE than I Needed: BETTER than I expected	21
These sanders are nice, light, powerful and last forever. Many idiots have my sander and it has taken a few falls, but still works with no unusual noises  and i like the hook and loop, but if you dont you can simply un  screw the pad and put on an adhesive backed pad. You dont realize how  useful the varible speed is unless you sand in tight quarters or alot of  refinshing. Also the hard dust cup is great better then the stupid bags or  little dust boxes. I would by this over the bosch or makita any day	21
Most of the big box stores used to carry this paper, but they have switched brands. I have been using this paper for general purpose sanding of pine, and it works great. For a while I was buying paper from HomeDepo and I was using more then one sheet for each cabinet door. With this paper, I can sand three doors with one sheet. I use different cloth backed disk for hard woods, but most of my sanding is done with Mirka paper. Put this stuff on an air sander and you can cut your sanding time in half.	21
My old Chopmaster blade was worn and I needed to send it in for sharpening but I had nothing to replace it while it was out. I use the miter saw all the time. So I bought a second Chopmaster. I forgot what an amazing blade this is! (and I didn't realize how dull the old one was!)I've put this up against 8/4 African mahogany, 5/4 Jatoba, 5/4 hard maple and 6/4 red oak and it cut through all like butter leaving a satin smooth finish on the ends.  I will never consider another blade for my miter saw!	21
"A bench grinder is not a precision piece of mechanical equipment.Most of my grinders are Baldor.  The Baldor is quite a bit more expensive.  Another feature of the Baldor is that the motor is long and ""slim"".  That is nice for someone who wants to grind on a 3-foot long blade, for the motor does not get in the way.  The Dewalt motor will interfere with the sharpening of a 3 foot long blade. However, a bench grinder is not the tool to use for a long piece of metal.  The Dewalt is certainly adequate for general shop use."	21
"I bought these for my Milwaukee M12 (12-volt) products since Milwaukee, unbelievably, does not make 12V bulbs and puts 14.4V bulbs in their lights which appear dim and yellow.I take away a star for either Amazon's poor packaging or DeWalt's poor protection because, in my first shipment, one bulb was exploded with glass dust all inside the package.This is an ""XPR"" = xenon PR bulb rated at 0.7A.  I noted that one bulb had the filament centered, while the other was off-centered and did not give as uniform of a pattern as a result (contributes for taking away a star)."	21
I use this tool weekly and it's well made as most Dewalt tools are.  This saw can be found elsewhere including the stand for less money.  A MAJOR FAULT in the design of this tool is when you go to switch blades or reposition the blade whole doing delicate scroll work is that the arm will not stay up and you have to find a 2x4 or something to hold it in the up position!!!  I have heard that there is some sort of retrofit available to solve this problem but can't find it.  Otherwise this is a great tool!	21
I purchased this guide for Dewalt's new trim routerDEWALT  DWP611PK 1.25 HP Max Torque Variable Speed Compact Router Combo Kit with LED'sand it works as advertised. The guide only works with the plunge base but that isn't a problem for me because the plunge base is more stable in my opinion. You should attach a wooden fence to the guide too to get more accurate results and so you don't mar the piece you are routing. My only complaint is that I now need to find and purchase a hose and/or adapter that fits this guide and my shop vac.	21
I purchased the Dewalt because their tools are historically of good quality. This sander does not seem to take too much off even if you use 80 grit paper (my little mouse sander does better job) and as for other features, I agree with the others that the dust port keeps falling off and the switch is suspect. But my variable speed option still works though.  After using it on a project for about 20 hours, the bearings went and I had to get it fixed.  Once this sander quits on me, I think I'll opt for the Porter Cable.	21
"I own a home remodeling business, and I've owned this saw for over 3 years. I have other miter saws that I use specifically as ""chop"" saws for rough framing duties; however, when I need to do finish work or flooring, I always reach for this saw. It is rock solid, durable and very accurate, and seems to be owned by every trim carpenter I know. Sure, 10"", 12"" and 15"" miter saws are easier to use for fat crown mouldings, but who wants to lug those things around all week. For its versatility, portability, and overall quality...Get This Saw!!!"	21
The noise is aweful. There's something to be said by doing things silently with fine handtools. Then there's doing things with good power tools and smooth running motors. Then there's my sons push mower that ejects plastic balls within plastic that clicks and clatters. This motor is maybe more annoying than a plastic mower.It does the basic job, it's cheap. If you're not doing many joints or are sticking to the basics it's fine maybe give it another star for limited use. Or get a 557 for twice as much, do more, and not be annoyed by that aweful motor.	21
I love this table. Had a craftsman before so it's not a fair comparison. Using a dewalt router in a Jessem insert to raise and lower the router by crank. I assembled it by myself ( paralyzed in a wheelchair from the chest down). Very easy. I did cut about 4 in. off the legs to make it shorter and built it in to make a cabinet with doors.  I recommend the Kreg casters and the Kreg on and off switch. I don't  use the micro adjuster. The table is very sturdy and well made. High quality. I highly recommend.	21
I can not stress enough how much I love this table!!!!!!  Initially, I'd bought a different (cheaper) table.  It was plastic and whatnot, but low and behold it got STOLEN!  I know, right?!  I hope that guy's lying in a ditch somewhere.  Anyways, joke's on him because that table was a piece of crap compared to THIS one!  It doesn't take long to put together, but once it's done you've got a very NICE table!  It fits all kinds of routers!  I use Dewalts in mine.  Completely adjustable and even has a hole in the back for your power cord!	21
This is a dead-on accurate piece of art right out of the box. I use it in shop for many fine furniture cuts that need to be tuxedo accurate instead of using my radial arm saw. In the rough construction field, it works all day long on a small honda (2000) generator with no complaints. If you knock it out of alignment from roughing it up too much in the field (all saws will suffer from this fate,) just take the time to square it up, and you're good to go again! I have found absolutely no issues with this product	21
This is an outstanding item. I ordered it on  Sunday Dec 3rd got it Wed. Dec 6TH 2006. The picture does not do it justice. This is a well made product. Nothing junky or second rate about it. Assembly took me about 3.5 hrs from the time I opened the box until I ran a piece of scrap wood through the router. I believe this will be one of my favorite woodworking tools. I have a Dewalt DW625 mounted to it. This is a large (3hp)router and fits easily into the cabinet.I highly recommend this fine American Made (!) product.Red Crane	21
"I've owned this set for about 3 years.  I mainly use this set to cut steel.  Other drill bits I've owned do not compare to these bits.The Pros:- they cut through mild steel like butter on the drill press.- they just keep cutting.  I'm waiting for them to go dull, so I can try out my Drill Doctor on them.  :-(- very nice metal case.The Cons:- they're not cheap!  But they are worth every penny of the premium you pay.- The smaller ones seem to like to disappear for a long time, and occasionally indefinitely.  Has anyone seen my 1/8"" ?"	21
I have two Starrett Combination Squares...the twelve inch and the six inch.  Both are absolute works of art in precision and accuracy and are truly fabulous tools to use.  Their astounding quality becomes immediately obvious when you hold one of them in your hands... and it gets even better when you use either one in woodworking projects. I have found myself admiring them, briefly, after each use...they are simply that nice.These squares ...are worth every penny. Beware to the buyer, though! If you get one, chances are, you will be able to easily justify the other, too!Handy Dan North Pole, Alaska	21
The Woodworker II blade replaced a Freud general purpose thin-kerf blade that was just OK.  It caused occassional burns when ripped a burn-susceptible wood like cherry.  The Forrest WWII (standard .125 kerf) does it all -- clean, burn-free rips in cherry, smooth cross cuts on hardwood, and smooth surfaces on both sides of cuts in solid core plywood.  It's unusual to find a product that handles multiple tasks as well they would be handled by several single-purpose tools.  This one really does it all. I have a 1-HP Delta contractor's saw and the WWII blade seems expensive, but it's worth the cost.	21
Power outages are not uncommon in this area and we needed a reliable source of light other than candles or standard rechargeable flashlights.  This light fits the bill.  It is nice and bright and the swivel head is very convenient.  It is also very useful for working in crawl spaces instead of dragging in one of the shop lights with the long cord and light bulb.  This light does not come with a battery pack but if you have any other Dewalt tools powered by 18v NiCa battery, they are all interchangeable.  I had batteries from an old drill and they work perfectly.	21
"You would think the case for your levels would be made at the same level of quality your levels are. They are NOT.First of all the carrying strap is NOT adjustable like the description says. It is a terrible design and awkward to carry with anything else in your hands.The 24"" and 59"" compartments are to small, you have to force them in. In less than a year I have holes in the corners of the pockets since it's so tight.Unfortunately no one else makes a level case that holds multiple levels, and having 5 or 6 level cases isn't practical for me."	21
"I have the PC 892 router. The Edge Guide I received doesn't mention the 892. There is a new ""42690"" (Why PC uses the same model number is beyond me).  The new version packaging does list the 892,893 routers and has a circle cutting attachment.  (see Porter Cable website)  The packaging is completely different in that it lists the other routers and the circle guide.  Beware of what you get, I WANT THE NEWEST IF I'M SPENDING THE MONEY FOR IT;  NOT THE ""CLEAN-UP BOY"", GETTING RID OF OLD STOCK.  Just time wasted, I sent it back and have to order from someone else."	21
After reading the reviews here on Amazon and with the great pricing on the DW788, I took the plunge and ordered both the saw and the stand.I've used several scroll saws over the past 40 years, I can say this is by far the best I've ever used!There is no vibration to this saw and the cuts are easy and flowing, and did I mention how quiet it is?If you're looking for a solid scroll saw, pay a little extra and get a solid machine, you won't be disappointed in the DW788.  Better get a dolly when it arrives, very heavy, solid product  A++	21
Very smooth motor. Soft start ramps router up to speed smoothly. Very good power. Do not really care for D handle routers. Thought I'd try it. Really just wanted the EVS motor from the router for my router table. Did not work to well in table as switch works only intermitately in table because of dust. Switch worked fine after blown out w/ compressed air. Milwaukee 5625-20 production router now resides underneath my benchdog router table. Well made router that gets a one staer demotion for faulty switch. Now motor gets used in my fixed base/plunge base 1617 kit when I need variable speed.	21
Spendy, but nice...This is a very good saw blade.  I've never had a saw blade that cuts rips of 3/4 plywood so thin you can see light through the pores of the end grain.  This one does it without shattering the cut off.Overall the blade runs fairly quietly and cuts cleanly.  I do get some light tooth marks in hardwoods but they clean up easily.Take the time to read the information sheet that comes with the blade.  There is a good discussion about how to true up your saw to take full advantage of the blade.  Well worth the time to do it right...	21
Very well done.  Beautiful small sculpture that is cast in a resin-like plastic, so that the details are sharp and not prone to warping.  The paint job is very well detailed for a pre-paint.  It's rare to find this kind of quality in game pieces.As will all X-Wing Miniatures, it comes with a handful of pilots and such.For the price you can't go wrong, whether you want it to sit on your shelf or join your game armada.	22
This is super easy to use, durable, comes with a great booklet all about Painted Lady Butterflies, you can easily hang it... it's just very awesome.  I really can't imagine anything you can buy your child that would be more memorable.  We received our butterflies fairly quickly.  They were tiny caterpillars at first, they quickly grew, and then formed cocoons.  We ended up with 8 butterflies.  The whole experience was simply amazing!  I can't recommend it highly enough.	22
If you're looking for a fun family game that challenges every one, try this!  It's great for kids and adults alike--we played it with my 25-year-old and 26-year-old sons and friend and everyone enjoyed it.  It's good for keeping your mind nimble.  Love the banana storage concept.  Looking forward to many more opportunities to play it.  Will give it as a gift--it's a wonderfully fun present that is sure to please.  Easy to store, too!  A perfect family game.	22
I got this for my son two Christmas' ago.  Boy, does he LOVE it.  He has mastered all the cards, but still goes back to the game.  It will really keep your child busy.  He was 6 when I purchased it and now at 8 years old it is one of his favorites.  My 6 year old is next to get it.  Absolute loved game.  A must have for a childs collection.  You can't go wrong with this one.	22
Simply put, this game is for all ages.  Just a delight to play, so easy to learn, but with so many twist and turns.  There is usually no clear winner till the very end of the game.  When the game is finally completed, with a 'surprise' winner so many times, I am always reminded of what Yogi Berra said: &#34;It aint over till the fat lady sings.&#34;  I usually dont get to sing, but this is still a fascinating game.	22
The left stick, on the transmitter, controls power and left and right turns. The right hand stick, controls forward/reverse and left/right bank.  This setup is most annoying.  The transmitter antenna is a prop, so don't expect outdoor type range.  This is strictly an indoor toy.The quad copter cage definitely protects the props, but, it will soon become annoying. It rolls around constantly and hinders control even more.After 2 days, the electronic gyros went bad and it became impossible to fly.	22
Bananagrams the game is ok, not great.  I guess some people like it, but it's not my cup of tea.  What this is to me is a great set of tiles in a portable bag.  I use the tiles to play another game, Snatch-It.  Snatch-It is a much better game than Bananagrams, but it comes with terrible tiles.  They're harder to read, and there's not nearly enough vowels.  Buy Bananagrams, buy Snatch-It, use the Bananagrams tiles with the rules from Snatch-It.	22
We just played this for the first time and we're hooked.  My 5 year-old can play, but strategy is a little beyond her.  The 9 year-old completely gets it, and both my husband and I thought it was great.  I love that it's so simple and easy to pick up-- just a bunch of solid wooden tiles in a canvas bag.  Kind-of like an abstract version of Scrabble.  Lots of fun.  As simple or as complicated as you want it to be!	22
I purchased this charger in January 2013 based on the good reviews.  Unfortunately, I purchased (new) it from a vendor at a swap meet.  It has always had a few quirks.  Today, it gave me the infamous &#34;SHORT ERR&#34; message while charging at the club field.  Now, I have no way of putting my lipos on storage charge until I buy a new charger.  I've tried different charging leads, charging from 110 and 12V car battery, etc.  I would not recommend this charger.	22
As an experienced mom of four I actually find this toy adorable and I didn't notice a problem of them tipping over.  Most pull toys they make these days tip easier than the ones my oldest played with.HOWEVER-beware- YOU CAN'T CHANGE THE BATTERIES.  And they just aren't as cute without the quack quack, quack quack, quack quack, quaaack.  :O)Also-how many times was that string pulled while the toy sat on a toy store shelf before *you* bought it???Cute toy but limited life span.	22
Present for my 7 year old son.  Really fun and simple game.  I believe it teaches kids to pay attention to detail.  I found my 15 year old daughter and her 17 year old boyfriend playing it and they enjoyed it.  There's only one set up and that's putting the faces in the frames when you first get the game.  Now when my son wants to play, we get it out of the box and start playing.  Each game goes really fast, too.	22
This was a gift from somebody to our (then) 2-year old son.  I didn't think he would like it.  I thought it would be just another toy that was taking up space.  But he immediately loved it.  He still plays with it two years later, and now his two-year old sister plays with it, too.  And every child who visits our house gravitates to this toy.  There is just something fascinating for kids about configuring the chutes and watching marbles roll down.  Highly recommended.	22
"As a dedicated gamer, I picked this up to play with my kiddo.  All in all, quite a bit of fun.  I think the suggested age of 8 is actually a little high.  My daughter is 6 and picked this up quite easily.  She really enjoyed looking at the ""treasure"" she acquired as she moved through the game.  I think boys would enjoy the visuals of all the monsters on the monster cards.  Really, its a fun and quick game that most families would enjoy."	22
"I love popup books and interactive children's books, and have to admit: this is one of my favorites. It's not complex/intricate, but it has a very cute storyline which combines colors, animals, and an interactive ribbon. If kids could make their own books, I think this is the kind they would make. Brilliantly done! I love how each page reveals a new color being added to the rainbow, and that when you turn the last page it ""reloads"" the book so it's ready to read again."	22
"The banana seems sturdy enough, the tiles are a lovely quality, and the directions are super easy, but the fun is all in the game. My husband and I play Scrabble a lot, but it can take sooo long. This game is much faster, easier, and more fun because everyone plays at once rather than waiting - sometimes endlessly - for another player to make the ""right"" Scrabble move. Highly recommended.I did order this game from Amazon, but it took more than six weeks to arrive."	22
My two and a half year old has been playing with this toy over three days now and he just loves it.  As he has figured out how to play with it on his own he has gained a sense of accomplishment and it is good for fine motor skills as well as learning consequences (if the gears don't mesh, they don't turn, etc.).  It is brightly colored, the sound can be annoying but no more annoying than most other toys.  I highly recommend this toy.	22
"I think others summed it up best but it is important to note that this is mostly a silent game.  Silence is not what I think of when I think of ""family fun.""  Family fun to me is shouting out answers, team work, and getting a little wild and crazy.While this game does not fit my definition of family fun, this game is truly fun, fun, fun in a different way!  It works the mind, requires concentration, and occasionally some quick reflexes.  Don't hesitate, buy today!!!"	22
I loved this game as a child 30 years ago and now I play it with my 3 year old.  She loves it as much as I did.  It has really helped her with her counting and even with understanding the concepts of addition and subtraction.  I'd definitely recommend this to any parent of a youngster to simply interact with them.  To teach them to be a good winner as well as a good loser.  To help them develop counting skills.  And to just have fun!	22
Ihad my doubts at first.  Let's face it, when someone says &#34;Let's play monopoly,&#34; the first thing you think of is Oh no! a long boring game.  Well, that was my first impression when my husband suggested buying the game.  Totally changed my mind from the very first time we played the game.  We have family night and couples night with this game.  It is fun and worth the investment.  I know it's a little on the higher end of cost but it is lots of fun.	22
But will you kids love it?  That is the question.  It may teach your kids about gravitational forces, or actiona and reaction,  all you like but will your kids like it?  Yes.  The downside is that they will only enjoy it after you set up the toy.  Some parents want a toy they pull out of the box and never have to touch.  You have to assemble this one everytime.  It's not as easy for kids to assemble as you would hope.  Good luck with this one.	22
Our family loves Guess Who?  We purchased this one NEW, rare for our household! ha!  Our preteen daughter at that time, liked the idea of this version because you can go online and print different sheets. So, this opened up many new games for our son and daughter to play.I buy Guess Who? board games to use in the classrooms. The ideas are endless. Words, pictures, concepts can be placed on the playing pieces and how players guess is open ended, depending upon the skills being taught.	22
I have played many many many of these 60+ piece games and have really had fun and have really regretted many of the purchases.  This one is a keeper.  I played it with my bro and his 13 year old son (who is a pretty smart kid).  We all understood the rules well and I was very surprised at how unique it is to play each time, yet with very adequate balance.  We all had fun and we all look forward to getting together soon to play again.	22
I have a grandson who has always been fascinated with wheels and things that spin.  When I saw this line of toys, it was just what I needed to add to my playroom.  I have bought 3 different sets but this was the first one.  It comes in a nice bucket with a handle and there is still plenty of room to add extra sets, of which I purchased.  Such a different type of toy but creations are endless, and fun for both young and older.  Highly recommend.	22
My GD, who is 3 wanted a cash register so I of course get right on Amazon and order one. Maybe I should have waited. She wrinkled up the paper money, put it back in the drawer and jammed it after about only 30 mins. of play. I think it might be more appropriate for an older child maybe 5-6..or maybe mine just isn't ready yet. I don't know. All it is a nice set and has the bells and whistles enough to be like a real one.	22
We got 5 caterpillars, all 5 turned into butterflies.  Be patient, we did have one slow caterpillar and I did jump the gun on him, thankfully I placed him in the cage anyway and he did turn.  My daughter (4) decided that we should let them go instead of tryi8ng to keep them life we did with the lady bugs.  We released them all 1-2 days after turning into butterflies.  It seems to take them a little while to learn to fly.Great and priceless learning for my child.	22
A couple teenagers were playing this when I was little and that's how I found out about this game. I've bought it since then and played it a lot with all ages. Usually when I'm playing with teens, I'll play the more complex version that includes having 2 face cards instead of just one. Most of the time, the 2 people have totally different features and you have to try to narrow it down without flipping down the wrong people!So try the variations as well....you might discover something!	22
Quick to learn, fairly quick to play, and fun, so kind of an ideal casual game.On the negative side, the pieces seem kind of flimsy; better weighting would definitely help. Perhaps they'll make a collectors edition with cast iron pieces! (not likely) Also, believe it or not, the game can be a little loud. I've noticed that when my wife is playing it in the living room while I'm watching TV it can be more than a little distracting. The sound of hollow plastic moving on plastic I guess!	22
Well... comfortably.  If you have (or are) a little digger fanatic, this is a gem.  Of course, the associated book (Goodnight, Goodnight, Construction Site) is great as well... but with or without it, this is a great pleasure and a great savior for parents whose little ones want to take their diggers to bed.  It is nicely made, and has the side benefit of being more manipulable for 2-ish-year-olds to pick up small objects than a &#34;hard&#34; digger.  I hope they soon bring out the doze and cement truck soon!	22
"This product appears to simply be official packaging for a game we've been calling ""Speed Scrabble"" for years.  Just ditch the Scrabble board and use the letters.  Each time a player finishes using all the letters he's drawn, he yells ""Draw 2!"" and everyone takes two more tiles.  The first person to use up all tiles wins.  Scoring is negative: just add up the values of everyone's left-over tiles, like at the end of Scrabble.For three or more people, it does help to have two sets of tiles, of course."	22
The game mechanic is extremely simple, which is good. You can play it with anybody and have a good time. You will be able to learn and laugh.If you don't one which one of the series you should pick, well I have 3 of them (Discoveries, Diversity and the Original one). The all work in the same way, you can mix them if you want, but if you only can pick one do it at random (unless you have a preferred theme) they are all good at what they do.	22
"This is a great ""first board game"" for kids, who will probably enjoy it from ages 3-5 or so.  Extremely simple to play, players take turns drawing cards and moving their pieces to the colored square indicated by the card.  Rather predictable, though with a few twists and turns thrown in, it is simple enough to keep the attention of the very young.  I award it 5 stars for educational value because it teaches color recognition, taking turns, and fair play (when these are reinforced by an adult playing along)."	22
I actually found these at home goods for [...]...well I am glad I did not pay more than [...]... First off the colors of the dolphins were all messed up..they didn't match their tubes...When I mean they didn't match...they put in whacky colors like red/orange colored dolphin but a yellow tube (no yellow dolphin) then we got two of the same colored dolphins.  Okay..so the colors weren't a huge deal I suppose but then the dolphins wouldn't whistle...that's totally useless...and as someone else mentioned the links don't stay linked. HUGE disappointment!	22
"Still, this game is highly educational and could be used to teach children about finances. Players must pick a career, manage a salary and family, and deal with various windfalls and pitfalls as they play- auto accidents (and they can buy insurance against this!), houses burning down, stock market crashes. Fun for everyone, including adults, and the whole family can enjoy it together. Just be careful of the small pieces if you have kids under the age of six or so. The cars and ""people pegs"" would be easy to swallow"	22
I've been playing Scattegories since I was a kid and it was Scattegories that got me hooked on board games in general.  That three minutes of silence during the scribbling portion of Scattegories is the most intense three minutes in all of gamedom.  It is possible to exhaust all of the cattegories if played enough times, but fear not because unlike many other games, Scattegories did make refills.  A great party game, but alas I have retired from it because I argue on behalf of my words a bit too much.	22
i picked up this game because i always like the option to play solitaire if possible.  i'm interested in the hobbit expansions, though after playing a few games of this, i will probably wait and get other expansions before that one.  i also picked this game up instead of game of thrones LCG because i heard that AGoT was more fun with more people, and this one scales well (making it fun with two, or even solo).  read up on any of these games on boardgamegeek for lots more info.  happy gaming!	22
This is a really fun conversation starter, especially on car rides. When we started playing it, we put the little tokens back in the box and never looked at them again. We found it a lot more fun to just ask and laugh at the responses and justifying why you would pick one over the other. Our games usually wandered off the cards whenever someone thought of something, but if you were stuck you could use the cards.I would recommend a purely cards-only version, no tokens or 'rules' just give us the scenarios.	22
This game is really fun, and not that difficult to learn. Only takes a couple of games to figure it out, and the games are usually less than 30 minutes.The game is 2 player, and it has a defense / offense type strategy with the corporation being the defensive player trying to score agendas, and the hacker being the offense player trying to hack and steal the agendas. There is also an element of deck building.Very fun, would recommend buying some sleeves to protect the cards. Can't wait to check out the expansions.	22
Every bit as good as Lincoln Logs, and at a way better value!  Yes, kids CAN break them, but only if they're playing with them like out-of-control beasts.  These stand the test of time. Refreshing change of pace from the electronic, blinking, noise making, cheap (but expensive) plastic toys.  It's nice to buy toys that DON'T do all the imagining FOR the kids.  Too much built-in detail in most toys today teaches the kids to depend on OTHERS' imaginations, and retards their OWN creativity and problem solving. two thumbs up for frontier logs.	22
This is one of the first strategy specialty card games I have ever bought.  I wanted to find an easy one to set up and play, quick gamestyle, and fun.  This is exactly what I was hoping for.  I liked the idea of character roles and it works out great. The gameplay is easy to explain to someone, is fun, and will be fresh for awhile with the bonus expansion that comes with.  Also, the box and cards it comes with are very nice.  Would recommend this game to casual strategy gamers like me.	22
Great strategy game as we're blown away after getting the game as its much more fun than expected.  I watched a video review on youtube about it before buying and it looked promising.  I think what first comes to mind is think Settlers of Catan but instead you set the dice where you want for what resources you need... so its sorta similar to that game in that way.  You build stuff and then battle monsters as well so it has a little more to it.  Settlers is a fantastic game as is this.	22
There is some assembly so while they were on their big hunt I was putting the playground together. I did have to use the instructional sheet as it was a little confusing. So, my kids by the end of their hunt has so many little bugs in their little playground and they were having a blast sitting on the floor watching all of them move around. The sad thing the kids weren't to happy since the bugs didn't really do anything in the playground. After a few days they did however forget about it.	22
somewhat dissapointed by this learning toyheres why....add $1.25 + 1.75 =  $2....it leaves off the decimal pointsthat is not what you want when you are trying to teach someone about money/decimals and fractions/parts of a dollar...the other negative, is when the cash draw flys open and the plastic coins fly out, all over the placeI had high hopes...In contrast, even though it doesn't look as fun, is this Texas Instruments TI-15 Scientific Calculator - 2 Line(s) - 11 Character(s) - Battery Solar Powered for  kids ! WORTH EVERY PENNY! AND an AWESOME learning tool!	22
"This was one of the first Gamewright games we purchased and it is a winner. Kids, parents, grandparents, even great, great grandma wanted to join in (we caught her ""peeking"" a couple of times when she shouldn't have, but hey ...).  I remember playing a similar game with just your basic deck of face cards (we called it ""No Peeking"") but Gamewright's ""peek"" and ""swipe"" (the ""draw2 is ok) are a great addition. My kids complain there are too many NINES in the deck. Lots of luck, but it does require memory and logic."	22
For the record, I'm an Ivy League educated engineer.  Not trying to sound snotty, but why can my 5 year old beat me consistently at this game?  It's because it exercises a different part of the mind than the typical strategy game, and apparently she can focus on the patterns faster than me.  It is really pathetic, but at the same time, it's good to have a game that I don't need to handicap myself at so she can win.  Only complaint is the cards could be a little better stock.  Otherwise, Highly recommended.	22
I have rediscovered this game which I used to play as a child.  My husband and I play it together and have a fun competition.  Also, it is small enough to take on vacation when there are spare moments and my cousins loved playing with us.... ages 8-16.  Of course they found words that I didn't!It really forces you to think, see and use brain power which so many other leisure activities don't force us to do these days.  And best of all you can play this with as many people as you have!	22
The classic game of Cooties is always a big hit.  My four year old loves to build her own bug and gets very excited to play.  We don't always play by the rules, but just being together and playing as a family for 20 minutes is nice.  The legs are a bit hard to get into the bodies as sometimes the holes are too tight or too loose and they go in at a weird angle - so we have to help.  But other than that, a fun game for kids of all ages.	22
This is a fun game for players of all ages.  The board depicts a map of the United States (in this version; other versions exist for other locations) with train routes of appropriate lengths between major cities.  Players have tickets from one major city to another.  In order to get credit for that ticket, the player must build their train between those cities.  Combine routes to get points for more tickets.The game requires logic in that you need to plan your route appropriately; longer legs earn greater point values.A good time is had by all!	22
Picked this up for my thirteen year old son. While it says eight an up, I think this is definitely for older kids as it involves a lot of math and thinking, which is a great motivator for kids to learn as it is fun and educational. You can teach it to do many things and bring you things, but accuracy is key, which is where the pay off is for getting your math right. Definitely a great teaching idea for kids and math and measuring, can be frustrating for younger ones but highly recommended!	22
Mastermind is an easy-to-play mystery peg game.  One player places pegs of given colors in a secret &quot;compartment&quot;, while the other tries to guess it.  They get clues after each guess; the other player reveals how many were the right color and how many were also in the right spot.  It's a little tricky at first, and if the person who sets the pattern makes a mistake, it can be frustrating.  This is limited as a family game because it only involves two players.  Ultimately, this is best for two people who enjoy mind problems.	22
This is a sturdy piece of equipment which is important. But I am quite disappointed in the quality of sound. The size is perfect for my three year old grand children. Wish I had actually gone shopping in the stores where I could have been able to hear what I was buying. I think it is a mistake to think that quality of sound  doesn't matter to a three year old. My intention is to capture their attention not dull it. So, no I don't recommend them. I didn't send them back, but should have.	22
Received this for my 1-yr-old and he still plays with it sometimes - he is now 3. It is really hard to get it to play music how it is intended to be played with. It is also way too big - I hate drying out all of the peices all the time when my son is done with it in the bath. He likes to play with the dolphins individually and just pretends with them instead of using it as it as advertised. It has poor musical ability...Buy something more fun with your money!	22
I played for the first time with my husband last night, and it was simple enough to pick up and learn (we didn't do the advanced play)We fudged some of the rules just because we forgot about some of the steps, but we beat the game and had a great time together.We've never played any D&D; besides Three Dragon Ante and the video games, but my husband has read some of the books.I liked the character choices and the enemies were interetesting. It was challenging but not so much that we didn't want to keep playing.	22
Not very easy for my little kids to use but it works. They get confused on the up or down arrow. Not sure on the settings until after a minute, then the clock shows the minute/time. They like to see the seconds too but this doesn't  have the seconds. I keep one in the van so when we are on the road I can keep track of their reading. The library gives them awards/prizes for minutes read in the summer. They will read for prizes and this is a good way for me to keep track.	22
A lot of fun for you zombie-lovers out there. We really enjoyed that this game allows for opposing teams of players, rather than using an every-man-for-himself system. We've only played it vanilla so far, with 3 to 5 players, and it's incredibly enjoyable. You kind of have to pay attention to details, but not so much that you can't kick back with a couple brews while you play. Not too difficult for younger players.Honestly, my only gripe is all the female characters are hot (with comically ridiculous porn-esque makeup and costumes), but there's no male eye-candy!	22
The object is to get the red car out of a traffic jam in this easy-to-learn, but tricky puzzle.  There are four difficulty levels, from beginner to expert, and would suit anyone willing to try it.  Trucks and cars must be pushed out of the way to get the red car out.  It's unlikely that you'll find this too easy; the expert ones are really tough.  If you're stuck, look on the back of the card to see the solution.  In summary, I think this is a good and fun way to flex your mental muscles.	22
I bought this toy for my daughter's 3 year old birthday.  She loves it and and all the silly parts.  It could do with some additional parts so I may buy Mrs. Potato head.The glasses do not stay on the ears properly and some of the parts are a bit difficult to remove (the ears and eyes sometime) but the good thing is, once in i know it is secure.  And when parts are not in use, they can store in his cavity (the kids don't like to see it there though, they love the mess)	22
I gave this to my 6 year old niece for her Birthday and she loves it. I'm told by her mother she plays it all the time. What's good about this game is that my niece along with having fun is also learning as well. She's learning about money and practicing her math skills. The game also helps her to learn to follow directions and take turns. Her favorite part about the game is winning. This game also takes a lot less time to finish than regular Monopoly which is good for childrens short attention span.	22
This is a pretty good game. Randomization keeps things interesting and sometimes makes the game harder. The strategy is to shoot the enemy while moving through the ship. Utilizing the various terrain can help a lot. I bought a few expansion packs for this game and they make it even more fun.Overall, it is a decent game to play. Wear and tear on the cards can get old, though. Luckily, most of the cards sit on the table as you play. Only a few cards are in your 'hand'.This is a challenging yet fun game to play.	22
For anyone who likes board games, miniature games or Sci Fi in general or Star Wars in particular, this is a great, fun, simple game that can be a beer 'n' pretzels affair or deeply tactical if you want it to be.The presentation and build of the models and included card stock pieces is first rate. The packaging protective and re-usable and the delivery I received from Amazon was super speedy.Boba Fett's Firespray, Slave 1 is a great model and it's in-game abilities and additional characters make it very competitive and a lot of fun to play	22
These are fun to play with.  Some things that need noted: 1) Don't plan on using these much, if at all, outside.  The smallest breeze messes them up.  2) I ordered two of these and getting the channels setup is a little difficult- not impossible just difficult.  3) If you need directions, the ones that comes with these are not the best.  My advice, throw away the directions and figured it out on your own.Don't get me wrong for the price these are a lot of fun.  My 9 year old daughter has no problem flying them.	22
Purchased this to teach my small son about handling money and reinforcing basic simple math lessons. Nice large buttons and includes a real built in calculator.  Nice easy to read display, bills and coins. The bills are large and easy to read for small children and the coins are plastic with decent realism.I was not too happy with the included fake credit card but overall the register is perfect to teach children how basic American currency is broken down.  For the $20 I paid, pretty happy and fairly fun for my son to run his &#34;toy store&#34;.	22
"I remember liking ""Trouble"" when I was a kid, now that I'm an adult, it is really boring.  I played this with my kids recently, and the game started out ""fun"", but eventually started to drag on.  There isn't much strategy needed, and doesn't require much thought to play.  Pop bubble, move out a piece if you can, or see if you can land on your opponents piece.  I started to skip good moves just to try and make the game move along faster!  We eventually all decided to end the game and move on with life."	22
Do the games last all of five minutes? Yes. Is this game a pain to set up? Yes. Did my three year old understand that the goal is NOT to make the man fall? No. Do we all laugh and tell her she wins when she makes the man fall? Yes! This game is definitely not a set it and forget it game, parents have to at least be around to set it back up. But it's simple and the kids love it. These classics go for next to nothing around the holidays, so stock up then!	22
We got this for our family for Christmas and it was great. The game has a similar feel to Settlers, but isn't quite as cut-throat, so it's easier to get through a game without people feeling frustrated at each other. I can see why this game has won so many awards. I also love that it comes with three extra train pieces of each color so to account for pieces ever getting lost. The only thing we didn't like was that all the cards are very small (about 2 1/2&#34; tall) making it very hard to shuffle them).	22
"This a fun game to get people to loosen up. It requires people to actually move around and engage each other in conversation (and not intellectually).  As others have said, this is a game for those to let their inhibitions down.  If you are in a group of people who don't like ""meaningless"" conversations or activities, then this will not be for you. For a large party, this game will get people mingling and interacting with each other.  This is definitely a game that works best with more people.  Have fun, relax, enjoy it.  It's only a game."	22
I was skeptical of the foam mat when I opened the package, but it actually works well. My twins were about 15 months when we first bought and to my surprise were able to get the concept of this toy, however would get frustrated and give up quickly. At 19 months they have this toy mastered. They have developed several ways to play with it from sorting colors, building towers, and even putting them on their fingers and pretending they are puppets. It sometimes keeps their attention for half an hour. A great addition to our toy collection!	22
The cool part about this game are the see thru cards. It's a story telling game. You don't have to do story telling  but it makes it more fun. I saw Will Wheaton play it on youtube. I have bought 2 other expansions. You basically are trying to kill off your family  but your opponents don't want you to die first so they play cards to keep you happy. Easy to play. If you are not offended about death subjects it's a great game. It's kind of like the Addams Family meet the Munsters in a card game.	22
This ship is an excellent support ship to have flying alongside the falcon or y-wings. Just don't expect a attack ship. It is a very limited ship without the upgrades.cons: the pins that come with the ships are a little flimsy and are prone to cracking. Fantasy flight needs to put out a replacement pack. With this ship in particular the pin glued to the inside of the ship snapped on the 2nd time we were setting up to play. I will need to glue it back together but I wish they were a little stronger than that.	22
"Battleship is a classic game that I played for hours on end with my older sister and is just as fun as I remember from my childhood.The general game play revoles around both players placing thier ""fleet"" on a 10 x 10 grid and then taking turns bombarding the other players fleet, attempting to find and sink all of their ships.The pegs still fall all over the place if you bump the bins hard enough, which makes it important to still play on a stable surface.All in all a good ""old school"", no batteries required, enjoyable game. Recommended!"	22
Bought this for Christmas 2012 for my daughter who was 6 at the time. She absolutely loved making this book.  You have the option of showing the kids handwriting, or having it typed. You pick a book color and its hardcover. It looks really nice and professional. We have bought additional for gifts since then.  I think it's an excellent educational gift to give, and memories can be created that will last as long as you own the book!The great part is that the assembling of the book is included with the kit that you buy here.  It's wonderful!	22
I got this for my 7 yr old son to take with us while we traveled for the holidays.  I worried it might be &#34;boring&#34; to him in comparison to his DS, his books and such.  But he played this with me over and over.  I was so grateful for it while we waited 5 extra hours in the airport.  The pieces are attached, which is great for not worrying about losing them, but they are held on very tightly and we had to work hard together to turn them over.  Don't know if they'll loosen up over time.	22
Overall this is a great toy, it's fun to play and pretty good for travel.First small issue was that the marker didn't last nearly as long as I figured it should.  The other is the loud snappy noise that the letters and body parts make.  I'm too conscious of it to let the kids use these and other similar Melissa & Doug games on an airplane, and in the car it's really annoying, especially when they inevitable move from playing with it the correct way to just flipping all the pieces back and forth just to make the noise.	22
What I didn't realize when I got into the X-Wing Miniatures game is that it wasn't like most Fantasy Flight games - this was a collectible miniatures game versus a living card game, or board game. As such, to play in tournaments, you need the extra expansions, and the additional X-Wing is a must for Rebel players. Giving you an extra ship, extra pilots, extra droids, have fun playing as your favorite Rebels like Wedge Antilles.This is the same model as the one that comes in the starter set, but for larger battles, this is needed for the Rebels.	22
I first played this game about ten years ago with my friends as freshman in college. It's a great game that takes a bit of time to understand the many rules, but once you do, you'll get hooked.This newer addition has added Gadgets and a few other new cards to mix up the game. It's easily a family game, but not for kids under 6 I would guess as the rules can be pretty complicated. It's also a great way to enjoy elements of history and play with the ideas of how connected major events could be in history.	22
This little 4channel RC single rotor 'copter is really incredible for the small amount of money I paid (under $50). The amount of minaturized hardware (gyros, servos, etc.) on this small bird really astounds. Once you've mastered a Syma 107G you can step up to this Heli and master 4 channel fixed pitch flight. Hovers and flies right out of the box. Great packaging and a good instruction manual. Extra parts and two 180 MA batteries for 7-8 minute flights x 2. Well made and detailed. Super value. The most fun and excitement I've had for the money ever.	22
This game is so much fun!  Even my mom who hates to play games with me, will play this game!  I like this game because everyone can play it!  Fun and educational at the same time as you learn to build words and you can even use it to show how to use a word and grow from it.  I think this game is worth the money they charge.  My only regret is that I didn't get one with a turn table luckily my mom had one from the 70's and we use it.  My advise buy this game!	22
The At the Zoo Jumbo puzzle is very cute.  The colors are lovely and the art is whimsical and fun.  The puzzle is nice and large.  It was fun for the kids to put together.  I was slightly disappointed in the quality.  We had recently put together a Ravensberg puzzle and this puzzle does not compare.  The pieces did not feel thick or smooth like the Ravensberg puzzle.  The sides of the pieces weren't as rounded.  I liked the box and it makes it easy to put this puzzle away.  Overall this is pretty puzzle that is lots of fun.	22
This was another toy my 15 month old daughters teacher had. My daughter seemed to love to play with and ten months later still does. You can do so much with these, they are great for any child and a definate must for children who need work developing their fine motor skills.  My daughter has down syndrome and I think this is great.  The only complaint it to try and pull them apart is very difficult, you actually have to twist them inside each other to try and loosen them up. But all in all it is a great toy.	22
The game comes in a sturdy box with good quality tokens, cards and dice (even though it's made in China). Good re playability vale. The theme is good, and the game does not take long to finish once you get the hang of it. (max 60 min, win / loose). Great game to play solo too, and so far I have beaten the game twice and lost half a dozen times, but it's still fun to play (unlike the Death Angel : Space Hulk card game, which has less than 20-30% chance of winning, but that another review :) ).	22
My daughter has hours of fun with this toy or rather science kit. There are lot of small experiments to understand concepts in magnetism. It is definitely worth for kids to play with this sort of experiments at early age.&#10004; Has multiple projects, not just one&#10004; Everything is in a compact box&#10004; My daughter started exploring on her at age 9&#10004; Highly motivational. As parents we should encourage and get right things for kids. This is in alignment with MAKER Faire philosophy that people need physical things also to explore and get them motivated on science and math. Highly recommended	22
Our daughter (she is 2) has one of these at her grandmother's house and uses it often.  While it is not her favorite toy, she will frequently get up from whatever she is doing, go over to the easel, draw something, and sit back down.With no bells or whistles, literally, this toy just lets a child be creative.  It is also much easier to draw on than the floor and you don't have to risk mishaps of writing on tables.  Our only problem is that sometimes she forgets that markers and crayons are for the paper and not the blackboard.	22
This is a really fun expansion to the great Lords of the Water Deep game. I gave it 4 stars because it can get a bit boring after about 7-8 games.  But it does add to the play in different and fun ways.  I find the cards that came with it more entertaining then anything on the board.  the concept of skulls (and negative points) and derivatives of this is quite interesting particularly at first.  You can incorporate this in.  I will say though that if you are a savvy group of players you can learn to master this rather fast.	22
I never cared much for Lincoln Logs when I was a kid, but I thought my kids might like them. You never know, right? But it seems the same thing is true now as it was when I was a kid: Lincoln Logs are great if you like building log cabins, and only log cabins. And my kids don't seem to be terribly excited about building log cabins. As to the toy itself, the pieces are not constructed very cleanly, so the pieces don't hold together very tight. It's a decent toy, I guess, but just not our brand of fun.	22
My son loves to recite the No More Monkeys Jumping on the Bed story.  When I bought him the book with all 5 stories I saw these to go along with it. They're cute, and he does enjoy them but they're a tad be awkward.  They're too big to really be finger puppets on an adult's hand, let alone a 3 year old's hand. They do velcro together so they can hold hands and you can make them jump.  He was excited about them, but they aren't really a favorite of his.  I probably wouldn't pay that much money for them again.	22
Really easy to teach and learn. Pieces are a bit on the small side so tiny hands might mess up arranging them.  An adult needs to put the pieces down first.  The pieces all need to be face up so that the fish are showing.  After that, each player takes a turn moving, then removing a fish.  It's pretty simple, but kids get very excited.  You need to prepare them for getting stuck and not moving the rest of the game, but most kids don't seem to have a problem with this as they have multiple playing pieces.  Again, fun and easy.	22
I bought this because it was on sale one day, and put it into my son's playroom.  I thought it would be good to learn about counting and practice shopping. I had no idea it would be such a hit.  He never asked for one, but was so excited when it was in his room.  When we have play dates we have both boys and girls who flock to it to play store.  So I can definitely recommend it.  It is built well, it holds up to being dropped on the floor, the money is cute.  And kids seem to love it.	22
This 'game' will most likely be a winner with anyone 5 or beyond who likes solving puzzles.  I originally purchased Rush Hour as a gift for my 5 year old son who loves puzzles.  However, it was so much fun that I found myself pulling the game out while my son was asleep and driving solo.  Since that time several of my relatives have joined in on the fun during family visits.  So this Christmas we purchased additional copies of the game to give as gifts to family members who asked for it.  While the packaging is poor, the game surely soars.	22
There is a reason nearly every child owns or has at least played Candy Land at least once. Its a classic. It's easy to learn & small children can join in the fun because they don't need to know how to count or read. If they can identify colors, they can play. We had a Candy Lane game for our first grandchild. She lives 2 hours away. She enjoyed the game so much, we let her take it home. This game is going to remain at Nana's house so all of the grandchildren, as well as Nana :) can enjoy the game.	22
I don't understand why, but this game has changed since I was a kid. The concept and game play is the same, but the board is terribly laid out. My young children cannot figure out which direction to go, and frankly, I have to look very carefully in order to help her. The game takes a long time to play, and often we get confused about direction and such, because the board is so busy and cluttered. I think Chutes and Ladders could use another revamp. I wish it was easier to play, like the version I remember from my own childhood.	22
"You can't go wrong with Mr Potato Head.  You and your children will have hours of fun making up silly faces no matter what their age.My daughter received this for her second birthday and was playing with it straight away - the pieces are easy to insert into Mr Potato Head and any piece can go in anywhere making for some interesting ""Mr Potato Heads"".The suitcase is a fabulous idea - so many pieces to make so many different combinations of faces and they all fit into the suitcase for storage and for taking on car trips or visits to grandparents.Fantastic toy!"	22
This is a nice size and is made very well. The pieces are very sturdy.  Once your child uses perceptual, and fine-motor skills to put the puzzles together you can use the puzzle to learn about various animal such the koala, ploar bear, lion.  The sturdiness of the product means it will be long-lasting.  The box has a neat rope handle for little ones to use when taking their special puzzle from room to room or from house to house. Puzzles are becoming a fogotten activity/skill but I am glad that this one was a big hit.  I recommend it for children 3-8.	22
if you have purchased those horrible air hogs from walmart and were dissapointed, then forget about it because THIS HELICOPTER is literally giving perfect control. it goes up in the air like it should and it doesnt spin, it doesnt do anything until you enter a command. you can make it turn right, go forward, go backward, any direction you want. and it goes perfectly.  i dont know what this gyroscope techonlogy is but it WORKS. you wont believe how perfectly this thing moves. and you dont need to adjust the trim at all. this thing worked right out of the box perfect	22
This is a more than ok game.Not the best,but good.If you like the &quot;Spyro&quot; series,you'll like this for sure.The gameplay, control,sound,etc. are all like the first 2.The only problem is it's EASY.Really,really easy.The levels are about 5 minutes long each,and the total gameplay span is about 7 hours.But still, thats better than it being hard.It's still pretty fun and stays true to the first 2.And Crash's little sister premires in it. Here's the review:Graphics:4/5Sound:5/5Music:3/5Fun:4/5Control:D-pad:3/5Analog:5/5Overall:4/5hould you buy it?:Yep	23
"I just bought this game a few weeks ago,and it's awesome. It just has that ""This is going to be an epic game"" from the get go. It has great graphics,even to this day.First of all,this is an Action Adventure,not a RPG/Role Playing Game.Next,I recommend buying the Strategy Guide. This game is what gamers call ""Nintendo Hard"". It's a challenging game,with quite a number of puzzle parts.Anyway,buy it if you have a 64,or Virtual Console it if you have a Wii."	23
I bought the dreamcast with high hopes.Mostly because of Street fighter and sonic games.The only good games are Sonic Adventure 2 and Dead or Alive 2.Sega has made systems that all have failed.Like the recent Saturn.For the first couple of days its good.Cons:Very LoudNot may places to rent gamesNot many gamesNot many demo disksPros:Good GraphicsEasy ControlsEasy to hook upEasy to hall aroundOverall the dreamcast stinks.If your looking for a system with fair graphics,lots of games,good games,easy control i'd buy the playstation.	23
This is quite possibly the most creepiest game ever! Well, it is the most  creepiest I have ever played.. The ultra-realistic graphics, amazing CG  sequences, spooky ooky musick, and overall feeling to this is truly *evil*!  I have played this many many times, and it never gets boring.. and plus, it  has great re-play value, not to mention the mega-kool *Alien* ending! ^_^  This is a must for all hardcore gamers..Pros: -Realistic grapics- Creepy  musick- Great replay value- Great storylineCons:- NONE!	23
I dont like platform games.I thought id absolutely hate this ... game...but its really cool.The frame rate is absolutel amazing with NO NOT A BIT of pop up.The graphics are incredible as well.Sonic and his fully 3d environments look great.This game is really cool and is probably like nothing youve played.Sonic does huuuuuuuge cool jumps and runs real fast, and the frame rate and grphics keep up with him.The sound is also really good, the effects and music fit this game perfectly.	23
Evil has once again awakened in the dark prince's palace.With alot of bad guys and 10 hard to beat levels,and don't forget our stars of the game,a brave,kicking butt little girl,Carrie.And a brave young whipping man,Reinhardt.This game will keep you on your tippy toes.You explore an old huge house,Dracula's castle,the forest,and even places you would only see in your nightmares.This game is for 11 and up due to strong bloody violence.Great music and setting.This is a game you can sink your teeth into!	23
This RPG (Role-Playing Game) is pretty easy to play and lasts a long time.  To play, you simply asign a weapon, such as a sword or the hook shot, to A or B.  The battle sequences are very good for a 2-D system and allow fun battles.  It's often hard to find out what to do, but usually isn't frustratingly difficult.  Many secrets are available which, while unnecessary, make it easier and make it last longer.  I recommend this game for all people.	23
This is a great game to buy for people who have been using Nintendo for years and those who are new to the license.  Smash Brothers is a fighting  game where nintendo characters (Mario, Yoshi, Starfox, Pikachu, Samus,  Kirby and more duke it out.  There are four hidden characters, a few hidden  features, and a hidden arena to be unlocked after a ton of gameplay.  The  sound is good and the graphics are good also.  A fun game to both play and  watch	23
Man, this game was mysteriously creepy. So worth the time, money and brainwork. Makes you wish you could see all the characters faces up close~for more effect. I didnt know if I was going to be really scared or just creeped out. Creeped out won. A great story line and wonderful game for Adventures. Its about a man that has no idea where he is, why or even who he is...he just wakes up in a Sanitarium......enjoy the journey to this &quot;crazy&quot; world.	23
When I first played this game, I knew next to nothing about the sport of golf. I rented it for three days, not only learning how to play golf, but  quickly becoming horribly addicted to it.A month later I now own this  fabulous game, and I also play golf too, although my real game needs some  work, Mario Golf doesn't. It's fun, challenging experience that everyone  can enjoy. Bring over your three friends and play all night, it's the best  golf game ever made.	23
The sequel to the very popular Tekken, Tekken 2 takes everything that the original had and expands upon it. More characters, more levels, more moves, Tekken 2 is a classic and should be in the library of any fighting game lover.The combat in Tekken is one of best ever. There are so many possible combinations, it's almost impossible to remember them all. Each Tekken gets better and better. Another thing I love about this game is the music. It suits the stages, and characters, well.	23
Acclaim Sport's release of Attitude revolutionized the way wrestling games look and sound. The WWF Superstars' faces and bodies were scanned with stunng accuracy and detail. Along with visuals, each competitor's theme music and (partial) entrance was added as well. Collision errors and long loading aside, this game is something else. However, the controls were less than responsive. Acclaim used the Mortal Kombat button combos for each set of moves and, to be frank, it was a like Chris Beniot, a pain in the neck.	23
Yep, don't fall for the PS2 hype and the glitchy DVD player @ 100 dollars MORE than a Dreamcast. Step right up and get a taste of what real videogaming is like. This system has the power, the library, and the price.  If you are looking for more, you won't find it. Games to try: Sonic  Adventure and Crazy Taxi ... around Xmas these games will be ... as  well, while PS2 games that are inferior will be .... Can I make it any  clearer?	23
"This is a great game and remake of the original ""Theme Park"" made in the early 90's (?).  It is so addicting and time consuming so make sure you've got plenty of time to waste before you sit down to play. (...) It's definitely a great game, although the graphics aren't quite up to snuff with today's technology, but you get over that.  It definitely has challenges, too, so don't think you can just breeze through the scenarios.  A definite buy for your family gamer."	23
The DreamCast is a truely remarkable game system with online support and tons of great games. It is said that by the end of March Sega will stop making them and develop only games. If this is the case which it seems to be, you best get one now as games like Resident Evil: Code Veronica, any StreetFighter you need, Shenmue, Grandia 2, Skies of Arcadia, Ecco the Dolphin, Crazy Taxi, Phantasy Star Online, Sonic Adventure 1 and 2, and many many more are excellent games.	23
first of all, this is not a flop. I dont know who would hate this. There are so many good games like Doom, Hexen, Duke Nukem, Resident evil, Silent hill, medal of honor, twisted metal. But mine broke after 7 years of usage. The engine burned out and it would turn on but the discs wouldnt spin. So, i suggest u get the new model to replace this one. Or a ps2. But, if u find one of these in mint, i garuntee it will work.	23
This game introduced me at a young age to communial development planning, and money management. This game is, I guess you could say, one to grow with, it takes time and it helps one to learn along the way. I'd also like  to add that it helps, especially a younger mind, to experience freedom with  their money allowing them to spend it as they choose. If he/she spends it  unwisely (go bankrupt) that person will know to become better managers of  their money the next time.	23
If they made more games like this, I'd be a pauper. Intelligent, funny, easy to use, easy to solve, and no bloody chess problems. It's also thought-provoking, gorgeous, well-written, and as believable as talking skeletons and elevator demons can make it. One of my favorites that I play over and over again. One caveat: At least one puzzle seems to be tied to processor speed, so if you have a fast machine you'll need to download a patch from the manufacturers' website. Well worth the trouble, though.	23
This game is horrible. First, I bought this video &quot;game&quot; because I thought it was fun. Well in wasn't. 1st, the graphics are poor. 2nd the computer's difficulty level is so hard. If you play with one, two, or three people, you always lose. The computer is WAY more expirenced than a human will ever be, and it just degrades from the fun factor. So ignore the reviews that say it is so great. They are overexxagerating. My 8-year-old brother got bored with it in 3 hours.	23
I bought this game for my 7 year old son, expecting it to be a good one.  The graphics are average (better graphics can be found with Spyro, year of the dragon), and the levels are very frustrating, I found myself throwing the controller away several times trying to help my son get through the levels, even though I consider myself a good gamer.  I finally recommended my son to play Spyro the dragon instead to avoid anymore frustrations.  I won't recommend anyone to get this game.	23
Despite awkward controls that seem to be designed more for a computer than a Game System (and get used to it, because that lasts until the PS2 era-- aka, the sixth game in the series) this has to be one of the funnest games of all time. It gives a challenge on multiple levels & inspires you to keep playing to find out what happens next as things get progressively more dangerous and more bizarre. Was re-made as Tomb Raider: Anniversary, but I'd prefer the original any day.	23
Power Stone is a fun filled action game that every one will like.It has fast action!  Fast pace baby!  The way I like it.The desighn is great.  The level desighn in Power stone is awesome.Gameplay is great!  Thats what it's all about.  Gameplay.  It's also easy to use and learn.  The game will last for awhile but You will eventually get bored with it.  But not for awhile.This game is great...I give it 5/5....It's really good trust me.I haven't played Power Stone 2 though.  But get this game.....Later...	23
This grows on, in, and around your consciousness.  Castlevania: SOTN is bliss, a heavenly escape from life.  Transcending mere fun, this game becomes a way of 10-hour life; maybe not so long, but one joyous ride.  Corny voice acting gives a lighthearted twist to the intended serious story, but that's hardly enough to detract from the uncut fun.  If you enjoy hybrids, I've counted these genres: platform, action, adventure, and RPG, one heady mix, and need nonstop action from your games, Castlevania should have long ago been yours.	23
Great game. Old now of course, but still fun to play. Good gameplay and pretty good graphics, not the best but good. Fun shooter. The Half-Life series is really successful and this is the game that started it. You dont have to have a great computer to play this game and thats the plus of it. I never beat this game, but got close to it, I just got stuck lol. If you are new to the Half-Life series, then this is the game to get. Check it out!	23
Yeah this is one of the classics that blew away everyone (N64 MAGAZINES got better because of it!!!) and bonded friends and family for years on end. There was no other game like it. Empire magazine started writing better games reviews because of it. This was a mental good multiplayer in 1997. We all played this side by side for years. I can't say I have played anything quite like it since. Golden Eye N64. Yeah, those where the days!!! I remember this left Playstation 1 owners in awe.	23
Ok , just like everyone sez, this IS one of the best games ever made and you SHOULD buy it immediately.  But it does have some flaws.First of all, a lot of the weopons in this game i dont like. There is only one machine gun ...only one shotgun ..one pistol , etc.  Cmon, wheres the variety??Second, the Team Fortress add on that comes with this game really sucks. It is no where near as good as counterstrike.Anyways,  Buy Half Life and download Counterstrike for free of the net.	23
This must be what they call a pageturner in the world of books. You just can't stop playing it. It has one of the best story lines in a game ever, and without doubt the best story in a FPS ever. This one is going to be  hard to follow up, and it must be seen as the new standard in FPS, from now  on you'll be talking about Half-Life clones, instead of Doom and Quake  clones.Treat yourself with the luxury of Half Life, and you'll never  regret it.	23
If I had a choice between SC 2000 or SC 3000 I'd have to say I'd choose 2000 though its graphics are not as good it's a lot more fun and easier to start.  I'll have to admit when I first began playing I was shamelessly addicted.  But after two days of playing I had my map completely filled and no more room to build.  The game is fun for a short while but gets old real fast.  I still highly reccommend this game for a boring tuesday afternoon.	23
this is the best n64 game ever made next to the wonderful ocarina of time.i beat everything in it when i was 9-i collected all the jinjos,got all the puzzle pieces,etc.i bought it when i was 8.it's an amazing,fun game.i just feel tormented that i had to use the players guide to beat the 2nd,banjo-tooie.i try not to think about it.but this game is extremly hard and grueling-but in a good way.the levels are extremly detailed and fun.my favorite is the graveyard/haunted house level.(i forgot it's name.)buy it.i command you.	23
Extremely difficult to play unless you're an expert. Great graphics. Problem with this video game is that it does get old after maybe an hour or so. Many levels to conquer. I'd only recommend this game to those who have plenty of patience. You know, the SAME kind of patience you need to have while on Ebay just waiting for a posted item's time to run out while them other 'have no-life' buyers often snipe the item YOU wanted SO badly in the last fifteen seconds. That kind of patience.	23
Seeing as how this is the first Crash game, it pains me to have to give this game a 3. The only thing that makes this game not quite as good as the others is it's lack of a very big story(and not to mention a horrible ending). Otherwise, this game isn't so bad. I give this game a 3 and a half. The graphics, gameplay, and music are fairly good. This game got me into the whole Crash Bandicoot Trilogy; and the games just get better along the way!	23
From it's solid 3d presentation, to it's immersive free roaming gameplay, to it's unique integrated puzzles, GK3 ups the ante for adventure games on this release..The experience is quite an immersive one, although I found some of the puzzles too tedious and actually got burnt out with the game for a while because of it....Probally my fault though, as the extremely high praise for this game makes me remember what it was like to once install a game that actually attempted to be an experience, rather then a mere game.	23
This is a good space simulator.  It allows you to control many different aspects of your people, including socio/economic model, resources, transportation, security, etc.  It also allows you to design your own units based on what technologies you have researched.  It is also a good macroscopic military strategy game.  It is turn-based, so if you play only RTS don't play this.  If you don't mind turn-based games, though, and you like space-based strategy games, you should play this.  The graphics are second-rate, but that is just because it is old.	23
I've played 'Um Jammer Lammy' when it first came out. It was as great than as it is now. A huge bonus/unlock once you complete the game on a certain difficulty is all the levels but played as Parapa the Rappa! And yes, Rapping!I'm not sure what kind of person you have to be to like this game, but for the going price for a brand new disc here on amazon at $0.98 you can't go wrong. And in refrence to one review I saw, YES THERE IS A TUTORIAL.	23
This game rules! It was very well conceived. The storyline is good, and the gameplay is awesome. I rented it before, and found out it is a game to buy and play. Trust me, you will get your money's worth! Good graphics, excellent sound scores, huge worlds, and good characters pull this game together. I am yet to find a game that matches it's surperiority, even Majora's Mask wasn't as good. I've beaten it several times through, and sometimes wish that I didn't know it like the back of my hand.	23
Super Smash Bros. is one of the first games I bought for the Nintendo 64 and I was not disappointed.The levels are great although they are limited the characters are all obviously awesome and the gameplay is solid.Although Super Smash Bros Melee is obviously better(more stages,more characters,more moves,characters easier to unlock,better levels,better graphics,etc)it is still one of my favorite games.The controls are pretty solid.The CPUs are challenging and its still exciting.I say get this game youll be glad you did.If youre not already a big Smash Bros. fan youll become one.	23
The graphics are well done.  The game play is pretty easy.  The mix of shoot em' up and thinking man puzzle play is great.  It took me awhile to get through the first 1/2 hour without getting my butt whooped, but once I  got the hang of everything it became very enjoyable.They weren't joking  about the realistic violence and gore.  Watch out if you're at all  squeamish.  It also has a couple of different endings depending on how you  play the game, so it has a lasting appeal to it.I recommend.	23
Are you joking. This is by far the WORST final fantasy in my opinion. Man, are you guys even trying anymore?  I looked at final fantasy x-2 and rented it and gosh, you cant even make a good game out of that.Man..bad graphics, horrible gameplay, sucky battle system, hard to understand, VERY difficult to get into it, too confusing, dumbxxx characters like cloud, hes the worst.(except sephiroth), sometimes too long of cutscenes, boring cutscenes, you can barely see their eyes &amp; mouth, etc. etc. etc. etc. times a million.I hate this game.	23
I have been a fan of fighters for some time now, old and new and one seems to stand out.  Soul Calibur is the fastest, strongest, and most entertaining of all.  It's got everything a fighter should have with no hang ups at all.  A large selection of characters (loads of unlockable ones as well), Number of stunning arenas, and multiple modes of game play that will never get boring.  I reccomend this title to any gamer no matter what you like.  Can't go wrong.  The best fighter to date, Weapons down.	23
All in all, this is the best platform game that I have played in a long time. Of course, it follows the basic formula of a platformer - kidnapped female, evil castle, jump on enemies, etc. But the reason the formula still exists is due to the fact that, occasionally, it works really well. Banjo-Kazooie is a case where the cliche works to perfection. Although we question Nintendo's blatant violation of the genetic cloning ban put in place by the president, they did so for a good cause, and a damn good game.	23
I tried to like this game, I really did, but the controls are horrible and some of the worst I've experienced when trying to shoot something. When playing I also wondered why it took developers so long to utilize the second analog stick and why it took so long for them to learn how to develop for the Playstation platform. While the story is well-done, it was hard to appreciate under the terrible gameplay. So I'll understand if Syphon Filter fans hate me because of this review, but seriously the gameplay is terrible.	23
This game is a great game for anyone who enjoys simulation games. The point of the game is to build a money-making metropolis. You start with a gigantic plot of land, your goal is to build and make your sims (simulated residents of your city) happy. You can do this by not raising taxes to high and supplying their demands. The game simulates time very fast but you can pause and modulate the speed. Overall, this game was great but the graphics are bad and gameplay is nothing compared to Sim City 3000.	23
This game is very interesting. I never played Warcraft 2 for more than 30  minutes before I bought it. I really got into it. But then you play the  second race. They are the same. If you want to play this and Starcraft.  Play StarCraft second, so then you won't find this one at times mundane.  Yet it still gets kudos from me. Just play Tides of Darkness and Beyond the  Dark Portal with your favorite LOOKING race. Take into consideration the  annoying Orc voice. Still good. Does not need to rely on graphics.	23
This game is bug landFirst had problems installing because it required some windows market software. Then it did not have any voice sounds. Then it was running on windowed mode only. Now, everytime I end a track it just crashes the computer (BSoD).I give up. Codemasters, next time, dont rush a game out just because you have to. Test the game! If not for yourself for Colin himself. If he was alive he would be embarrassed.And don't buy the game using Steam because if it does not work, Steam will show you the finger :)	23
I bought this game way back and recently played it again.. well..the game was easy to beat when i was 6 and its still as easy.Well, my problem(s)?Not enough characters and its just not very fun and.. yeah that makes it boring.. but if ur a fan of the older games ( like me ) you may like this game ( unlike me )It's cheap now so, I guess it wouldn't hurt to pick it up.. it costs as much cash as to rent a game at the videostore..so do what you want with it.	23
Unfortunately this game is just a hodge-podge of elements from the other games.  There are some interesting new units, and I did enjoy the much larger maps.  My biggest complaint is that it is so short.  You are just getting to use some of the more advanced units and the game is over.  You never get the big final battle like at the end of the last two incarnations.  This is by far the shortest game of the bunch.  I finished each side's campaign over the course of three nights, about 9-12 hours of game play.	23
You can say this is resident evil with dinosaurs but it's a little more than that. Definitely scary. Puzzles are a little complex and tricky. You'll need a pen and paper to figure them out. Cutscenes are awesome. Monsters are quick here. You no longer have the comfort of running away from a slow moving zombie. Certainly challenging. Four stars overall because this game is short, but still worth it.I did play Dino Crises 2 and it was okay. More of a shooter. Wished Capcom stayed with the survival horror element. They had a winner here.	23
First off, this is not the only color of the memory cards.  There are many colors.  You can save games onto this from Dreamcast games.  It works as a clock.  You can manage and copy files, and the connector things on the end allow you to connect it to another VMU.  it's great.  Trust me.And now, the drawbacks:1. Minigames take up loads of space 2. Copying files to other VMUs without using the Dreamcast is slow 3. The standard color is dull.Except for the 3 drawbacks I mentioned, this is worth every penny that you spend	23
This is the game that started it all for the Dreamcast.  Sonic got a new look and a whole new level of appreciation.  To bad after Sonic Adventure 2 things started to turn sour as he got ported to other Systems.Almost a decade later and I still have my appreciation for this title.Yes not everything is perfect, but it's still way above average.If you never played it before, please pick it up if you have a Dreamcast.  You will not be dissapointed at all and it is well worth the $10 you will spend for it.	23
So, it's definitely original, and true to formula, but there are a few aspects about this game that just don't make sense to me. The cell-shaded graphics take some getting used to, but I like them.My biggest complaint is that sometimes I'd be sailing somewhere, and could leave, make a sandwich, eat that sandwich, and come back, and still not be at my destination. Also, not including the side-objectives, it's a relatively short game.Is it better? No. Is it a Zelda worthy of the title? Yeah. I recommend at least playing it before making judgments or assumptions.	23
"The movie ""Goldeneye"" was a box-office hit and now it comes to nintendo. Every wonder how James Bond found Natalia, how Xenia died, or how Bond killed Trevalyn. Now you get to do it yourself. You travel to Siberia to recover blueprints, go on a battleship to save hostages, launch a space shuttle, and shoot all the bad guys you want with over 30 weapons from Gernades, lasers, all handguns, machine guns and rocket and nuclear bombs. Try out the game to see what you would do if you were Bond. Here's your chance to be 007."	23
This game I grew up with and enjoy very much. I have been playing this game since I was 6 or 7 years old and games like these are very hard to come by right now and they cost a pretty penny brand new. What I have is a like new version but unforutantely I lost the manuel and the box is long gone to mine but maybe I will find it one day while I shop around the internet. I love this game and recommend this game to old school video game players and the like.	23
After 90 or so inaccurate reviews, I have this to say : Epic Superman has awesome graphics, gameplay, voice-acting; and it's flight engine -- something alot people don't seem to understand so they bash the game; well, you see : people like me and Mah boi, Superman, can actually fly therefore we can accurately review Epic Superman. This game also has multi-player, which is nearly as good as Black Ops. If only there were online play.. -- I have to say, THIS is an accurate simulation of flight and the BEST game on a Nintendo console. Ever.	23
This game had it's pros, and it had its cons.  Pro - fun for everyone, good clean fun  Con - nothing really to difficult, just making sure you stop the line on another line.  Pro - Lots of different ways to play, you can play tournaments, or practice, putting challenges, and you have to get birdie badges.  Con - Usually Mario is the bomb guy, but in this game he's a really bad golfer :}  But overall, this is a good game, that a five year old can play, so go out and get your copy today!Jesse	23
If you have read my previous castlevania reviews you know how much I love these games and Symphony of the night is no exception. This game is just awsome,the gameplay is fun, the graphics are great and the music is kick ass. This is the best Castlevaina game out there so far and with Castlevaina:Lords of shadows coming out soon it is going to be hard to top this masterpice. All in all I highly recommend it, if you don't want to buy it and have Xbox live or playsation network you can buy it there also.	23
This popular title has a lot going for it - good graphics, excellent maneuvering and physics, and style to boot.However, the difficulty is much too high for even heardcore gamers. There seems to be something truly amiss with the makers of the game - despite the negative comments regarding gameplay, the game's sequel, Driver 2 (PSX) is actually harder than the original.In order to make the game playable, you either have to apply a patch released by Infrogrames or play in cheat mode. Then it will become only _barely_ playable.Unless you can find a cheap copy, avoid.	23
This game offers unique play. It has a pretty good storyline that keeps your attention, but the stealth required to play the game makes it a keeper. Unlike Metal Gear, you actually loose points by being spotted, even if you make it through the mission successfully. You can opt to go through the mission again for a higher score, or you can go on to the next mission. I liked that aspect the most because the second time around (knowing where everyone is hiding and waiting for you) you get to get the drop on them! Cool beans.	23
"I got this game at a video store recently, and they sell it for only $10.00, so I snatched it, thinking it was gonna be good. And then it was!GAMEPLAY: 10/10 Awesome! you're in a mansion with zombies and lots of monters (literally) and you've got a lot of weapons!GRAPHICS: 100/10: The graphics add to the scares. and plus, Jill has a nice ass.Dialouge: .5/10 HORRIBLE! From Wesker's  ""Stay alert"" and ""GET AWAY FROM HIM! HE'S INSANE!"" To Barry's ""What IS this?"" amd ""Well, Let's hope this isn't Chris's blood!""ENTERTAINMENT VALUE: 9/10 It's awesome!So go buy this today!"	23
What can I say that hasn't been said already?  Other that some minor bugs  that you can patch in a matter of minutes, the game is awe inspiring.  Improvment upon the first game includes many more hours of gameplay plus a  way to judge just how evil (if this is your perfered path) your character  really is.  Streamlined menus for NPC interaction in combat a major plus  and the addition of new perks is very nice.You want a game that has  great replay value and that you'll enjoy from begining to end?  This is it,  the last stop.	23
It's a game.  But the acting is no worse than the movie so I give it one  extra star because you can do stuff, not just sit there and watch the  lousey acting. &quot;Qui gon, I have a bad feeling about dis&quot;  Well,  it's kinda fun, I guess. You get to whack things with yer light-saber which  sounds much like the movie and the other sound effects/background ambience  are excellent in my opinion.  Music even better.  Gameplay OK.  Graphics  are not the best for now but very good for 1999.  You want a good Episode I  game, try Racer.	23
One of the few games I actually bought for the Dreamcast while I owned one.I was raised on a steady diet of Mortal Kombat and nothing really prepared me for how hard this game was.I'll keep it short.The graphics? Astounding.The game play? A brutal revelation.Incredible story lines.This game can be picked up and played by anyone but trust me...on the more difficult settings this is no button masher.You better know your character inside and out or you won't last a minute.I'll sum it up.Awesome weapons based combat.One of the deepest fighters out there.Not for the fighting faint of heart.Recommended.	23
I had high expectations going into GK3... and I was not disappointed.  I'm a longtime adventure game fan, and it's been quite a while since I've played one of this calibre. I've always wanted the kind of total freedom  and interactivity the 3-D engine provides.  I hope Sierra is planning to  use it again.  Additionally, the storyline is first-rate and well plotted.  Gabriel and Grace are very human characters, and the way they relate to  each and develop was perhaps my favorite aspect of GK3.  Also, quite a  beautiful game.  If you love a good story, do buy it.	23
Air Force Delta is one of the sweetest games on the Dreamcast! The graphics are not great but they are cool and more than get the job done. The varing missions keep the game refreshing and exciting and add a lot of replay value. The music is not worthy of a seperate cd soundtrack but it is good for the game. There are TONS of planes to buy which add some depth to the game because you have to choose a good plane for the various missions.Is you want a great flying experience for the Dreamcast look no further.	23
What can I possibly say about this game that hasn't been said a million times.Perfection.Groundbreaking.Beautiful.Just some of the words that come to mind when I think of Zelda 64.Zelda was my introduction to RPG's and what an introduction it was.The good.Everything.Graphics, story, pacing, etc...Insanely difficult in parts, I still can't beat the water temple without the walk through.And Ganon in the painting still has to be one of the coolest boss battles of all time.The bad?Nothing.One of the games that not only defined the N64 but a game that set the standard for excellence in RPG's.One of the best...ever.Highest recommendations.	23
The expansion pak will definitely enhance many of the newer N64 games (the differences I've seen on Episode I and SuperCross 2000 are very noticeable), but for the extra bit of eye candy I'm not sure this is worth  the money.  If you really enjoy crisper graphics, then go for it.. but I  think some people will find their money better spend elsewhere.Another  thing to keep in mind is that the N64 is becoming dated.  The expansion pak  will help it a bit, but if you are planning to upgrade to a new system then  I would save your money.	23
To be perfectly frank, the Microsoft Sidewinder is the most underrated  joystick ever made. My previous joystick was a Logitech Wingman Extreme.  Within six months of purchase, the Wingman was falling apart - calibration  was non-existent and the rubber case was disintegrating.So I bought the  Microsoft Sidewinder Pro. And what a fantastic joystick it was - it's  excellent for flight/space simulators like I-War or X-Wing: Alliance. The  precision of this joystick is amazing.So, if you're looking for a  high-quality joystick at a reasonable price, get this one. It's still one  of the most robust and reliable joysticks on the market.	23
This was the only Breath of Fire game I've beaten.  But I must say that it was fun.  The story and side quests kept me going.One of the downers was that you can't hardly change your angle.A big thumbs up going to the fact that you don't have to change screens to get into a battle (like Chrono Trigger).  This saves lots of time and makes thing more dramatic!  Fighting in narrow hallways and thick forests was great!I'm not going to spoil it for anyone...but the ending sucked badly.  But not enough to stop me from buying the next sequel.  ^_^	23
Greetings, I am Oklonia. My review of Super Mario 64 is right here.Super Mario 64 is a game that all master N64 gamers have to own!I don't even need to tell the story. What's happened? The same traditional story: Bowser kidnaps Princess Toadstool,Mario finds the princess, rescues her, and destroys Bowser.Capcise.The courses and star's names are quite creative. (e.g. Lil' Penguin Lost) They are more riddles though.The graphics are so sharp looking and realistic, that maybe just a few could go on GameCube. (GCN)Despite a few annoying sounds and no multiplayer mode, Super Mario 64 is really super!This has been Oklonia.	23
For all gamers out there, this is an excellent game to get! It is a role playing game takes you around Cloud's (you) world and you battle monsters and evil things. You meet many people and form a team of comrades to battle to the end. The graphics are quite exceptional and the magic is easier to handle than in Final Fantasy VIII. It kept me entertained for quite a while! I have actually played it three times through because there is always new things to discover and do. But your gaming life in not complete without this awesome game. --Jordan	23
I know what you're thinking... I need another controller. The generic can't be that bad, I might not like it, but I'll be able to play.No, you will not. You wll hate every minute of this.As others have said, the buttons are actually ok, but the d-pad will drive you insane. Rage quit-inducing. Don't bother, go out to your local retro store and pick up an actual, old SNES controller. The price will be well worth it. I've pretty much thrown this in the garbage, but I can't seem to bring myself to it for some reason, but it deserves it.	23
The first of the Mario Party games!It really is an awesome game. I only played it at a friend's house as a child really, so now, many years later, I finally decided to get it for myself, along with 2 and 3. The n64 games are classic.I really only play it by myself, but it is so much funner to play with friends. You can get so angry when someone steals your star. This is how you get in fights with your friends.The mini games are fun, not as fun as 2 and 3 though.Never going to regret buying this game :)	23
After completing and love FFX and X-2, I had high hopes for this game, and they fell a bit short. The bosses were extremely simple, the world map was irritating ( I found myself aimlessly wandering for long periods of time), the bosses were really simple, and many of the monsters were just irritating, not particularly difficult.However, the story and characters were great, and very long and in depth, with many events that blindsided me.Overall I enjoyed the game, and with the presently dirt-cheap price, you really can't go wrong.I'd recommend using a guide to complete it because it's so complicated though.	23
So far, I've played 1, 2, and 3, and this is probably my favorite.Gameplay:10/10: This time you are Jill from the original. Lots of areas, like the city, police station, hospital, park, clock tower, it's a big game! You also have a dodge move. And, the stalker zombie, Nemesis, makes the game shine, he's fun to fight. You also sometimes make choices on events! And a new Mercanaries mode adds to the fun.Music:8/10: Your standard horror tunes. Gotta love Nemmy's theme.Sound:9/10: Decent voices this time, and cool sound.Overall, if you are looking for a top notch horror game, you gotta get this!	23
I just bought the N64 version of the Gameshark and am somewhat satisfied with the results. I own No Mercy, which is plagued by glitches. Gameshark allowed me to gain all that I had lost in the game by unlocking all the secrets. A great peripheral for those who are stuck in a game. Unfortunately there are some glitches. Apparantly some games won't work with it, as my Resident Evil 2 kept locking up when I tried it with Gameshark. Also there are reports of it breaking after a few months of use. All in all a good tool, but buyer beware.	23
I love Castlevania and this is the best 2D Castlevania ever made. Unfortunately I didn't buy a copy 10 years ago so I guess I'll have to download it on Xbox Live Arcade since price gouging has come to the PlayStation version, I traded in my old PlayStation and I heard that it isn't compatible with the PS2s backwards compatability mode (a shame).If it was less than $15 I would definitely pick up the PlayStation version and a used PlayStation, but $60 is outrageous when it is available for less than 1/6 that price on Xbox Live Arcade!! Classic all the way!	23
Battle Tactics, the second expansion pack of the game (not a separate version) is a missions expansion pack featuring a LOT of stand-alone, separate missions (in other words, not part of a larger story).  The missions are split into three (if I remember correctly) categories based on approximate time needed to complete them.  Not all the missions are short.I played Total Annihilation (and its expansion packs) for approximately 3 years.  One of my favorite games of all time.  A classic that any fan of RTS games will enjoy.There is STILL an active community online, and many, many user-made mods and extra units.	23
This is THE scariest game I have ever played. It has demon dogs, birds, and so on. You find your self running around Silent Hill a lot. Just like in a couple Resident Evil games. The music makes the setting scarier. So does the fact that %80 of the game is set in the dark, and you have a small flash light that only extends 5 feet in-front of Harry. The game is not really fun, but if you like scary puzzle games, and demon dogs, this is a game for you! My advice: Don't play this in the dark! : )	23
I use to play this AGES ago and use to be pretty good. I started playing it again and I now found that the controls (at least for me) don't seem very forgiving. In order to do tricks you have to place the toggle in the exact correct place (at least pretty spot on). You also have to land in a specific position or else you crash (too many crashes makes it so you can't finish the race). The half-pipe mode is pretty decent though and can range from super easy to insanely hard. Overall a not so bad game for that time.	23
Rogue Squadron.  Every Star Wars fan knows the elite starfighter group of pilots.  Now you get the opportunity to experience what it feels like to hop into the cockpit of an X-Wing,Y-Wing,A-Wing, V-Wing, Millenium Falcon, T.I.E. Interceptor, and the Naboo Starfighter.  As you fly through over 15 missions, ranging from Tatooine to Mon Calamari, you'll earn ranks in the squardron&lt;the highest I've gotten is Gold Leader&gt;.  With each mission you complete, you'll earn a medal&lt;bronze, silver or gold&gt;and be promoted.  Do you have what it takes to buy this game, and prove you've got what it takes to be a top fighter pilot?	23
By far one of the greatest games i have ever played.  Great story, mind-blowing graphics, awesome characters and more.  Everything about this game is incredible, right down to the realistic breathing motions of the characters!  The soundtrack is the best I have heard out of any fighting game to date.  I am desperately trying to find it, but i still can't.  Let me know if you do! Lots of game modes and jam-packed with secrets.  It will take you a long time to get bored with this game!  This is the only reason I haven't sold my DC yet, since Sega abandoned it.	23
okay i like this game becasue its the most fun one to play more than RE4 but if i saw this as a movie this is complete Hollywood Like Batman and Robin. Hollywood castLeonadio Decaprio as Leon S KenndyJesscia Albea as Clair RedfieldCharlize Theron from Aeon Flux as Ada WongFramke Janssen as Annette BirkinIoan Gruffudd as  Willam BrikenDanny Davito as Brian IronsClive Owen as Ben BertolucciWill Smith as Marvin Branagh the Black guy 1st to die in the gameAriel Gade as Sherry BirkenKarl Urban as Hunk3 star was for its story i didnt like how Willam Kills himself with a shot for revenge	23
Sega does not even deserve a one star.  The only good games for Sega is Sonic te Hedgehog.  Sega announced the are making a deal with Nintendo to send Sonic to Nintendo.  Sega has decided to give up to the competition.  Finally.  They will now only make games.  I am happy for that.  I am a Nintendo Fan.  Zelda and Mario and I will be glad to see Soninc coming to Nintendo.  Dreamcast starting in February will drop ....  At the end of the year goodbye Sega.  Now our only compettioor is that damn Playstation and the Xbox will compete.  But Nintendo Rules	23
I Bought this game long time ago back then it was pretty cool but the game has no story to it plus your only supposed to run from point A to B shooting any moving object you go by (except for the Alien he cuts his way through) that's  the whole story.But the plus side of the game i that you can play three differnt charectors each with there own special abilities. Plus look out for the place called Fury 161 that's where the story of Alien 3  takes place.Overall a very good game but get Alien versus Predator 2. It's WAY better.	23
The first time I played this, I tried to get to the end too soon and wasn't able to win the final battle. Then I went through each area and combed it carefully. There are many artifacts and items which you need to win the final battle. Rings, Tomes, etc. Not to mention you better get youself maxed in levels before you even think about it.True to form RPG, you start low, have a mysterious occurance and you are on your way. Fun. My favorite characters are Boo and Minsk. There's even guest appearances by favorites from a couple fantasy series as well.	23
WWE WM 2000 is a great game with tons of matches..When I first got this It was around the time it first came out.Man this game is awesome.  They steel cage match, Hardcore match, and I can't remember but I think they had first blood?...I think...I don't remember.The graphics were good for it's time.  Gameplay was quick which is a good thing.  It is also the first N64 game to have blood in a WWE game.My favorite match is the steel cage.  It's sooo fun but I wish they had a Hell in The Cell match.gameplay 5/5matches 4/5graphics..for its time..5/54.5 out of 5Later...	23
I spent a week trying to get a grasp of the controls for this game.  I'm a true Batman fan and even I had to put this game down after several attempts.  It was either too dark so you didn't know where the character was going or you couldn't establish enough control of the game to fight the bad guys.  Not real crazy about the commute to the crime location as well, it was hard to locate where you were going, unless you are the true dark knight who knows every inch of Gothem City.  Unfortunately, the writers expected us to know as well.	23
Ok, I'll admit it, I have a Gameboy of my own. 40-something mother of two, and I got one for myself so that I could play with my kids. They're great! We are all great Pokemon fans, which is how we got sucked into the whole  Gameboy thing, and those are still our favorite games.The only drawback  that I find with the thing is that it does need to be well-illuminated,  otherwise you'll give yourself a migrane trying to see the tiny screen. But  that aside, these babies are fun! My kids love them, I love mine, great fun  all around. Go for it!	23
This game is cool, the gameplay is cool, and everything that people state about games are cool, but, DO NOT, AND I MEAN DO NOT, let children 14 and under play this game. It is extremly violent, extremly bloody, and extremly grose. You do nothing but go around and blow up zombies that devour living human being. Not to mention, this game will give you nightmares. I played the one for playstation and it is exactly the same as this: Violent, bloody, gross, and extreamly scary. I have to admit, when I played this at a friend's house, I got nightmares for three nights.	23
