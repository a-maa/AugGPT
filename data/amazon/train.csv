If only for the great bonus live disc. I am sure they could have just released the concert on its own and sold it out many times over. Like another reviewer suggested, this is even more thrilling than the El Mocambo concert disc, but they could've fixed that also by releasing the entire Mocambo show, un-edited. Setlists being similar, we probably don't need both, but heck, Elvis could release them anyway. A whole passel of live show releases would be nice, for that matter...Docked one star only because the bonus material on the first disc has already been reissued.	9
The most blazing cuts-  &quot;Rappaz R N Dainja&quot; (also try to find the rare remix by Rage Against the Machine's Tom Morello!); &quot;Ah, Yeah!&quot;; &quot;Squash All Beef&quot;, &quot;Represent the Real&quot;,  with Das EFX.&quot;Out for Fame&quot; gives props to graffiti artists.  Dope production tactics by DJ Premier, Diamond D, and cameos by Fat Joe,  Busta Rhymes, and a who's who of hip-hop personalities!One of 1995's  best albums, but still slept on!!  Go buy this record!	9
I'm a residential contractor. I bought one with my original SCMS purchase over a year ago. Ever since wished I had a second one ... so I finally did it. Now I won't have to switch the one around (I usually like it on the intake), and also I can hold both sides of my work at once when I need.It is well made and easy to use. And it is a great help when cutting hardwood or AZEK, both of which tend to move spontaneously while cutting.	21
Lies lies lies. I shouldn't have believed these positive reviews!! This is like mascara from early 90s or something, just black stain on your lashes, that put your lashes TOGETHER and clump. Oh yes it's waterproof so it gets a one star, thats the only good thing about it....it definitely isn't pretty!!!! And NO IT DOES NOT ADD ANY VOLUME. Wasted my money thank u very much! Sigh. I want my money backkkkkkkkkk!! Grrrrrrrr and I bought this for my wedding!!! D:&lt;I should've gotten l'oreal voluminous waterproof mascara instead......	4
I bought this product for $66 at Meijers.  The cats loved it and so did I, for the first 6 hours.  The kitty poo poo stuck to the rake, caused a jam and the entire rotating arm broke in a matter of hours.  I was so bummed. It would have made life so much easier.  Numerous reviews stated that the poos need to dry before they get raked.  This is true! C'mon you engineers.  This is the only product I would advocate animal testing on.  Great idea but a real mess to clean up.  It is getting returned tomorrow.  :(	19
I've used Pet Tab vitamins in the past, but have recently been disappointed to find that many of them are produced in India or outside the U.S.  Vetri-Science products seem to be of good quality and reasonably priced, so I thought I'd try these when I ran out of my Pet Tabs.  Unfortunately, the dogs don't seem to care for them.  My older dog spits them out even with peanut butter on them.  Once my puppy finishes these, I'll not re-purchase since they don't readily eat them.	19
This is the best dictionary ever. My son told me about this and it has everything in it and so easy to read- plus it speaks the word for you!  awesome.. the definitions are easy to understand.  I just love the word of the day.!  It had a problem for a few days and when I told them about it they fixed it so fast. ! I share all the word of the days with my friends. This is the one to get. Awesome people!plus it has Spanish words. !	1
This is a perfect baby proofing tool.  The strip cover will cover most standard sized power strips.  There is a hole on the side for the power strip to plug into the outlet and a wide opening on top for it to connect to the devices plugged into it.  It is really easy to put together- just snap shut in 3 places.  It is also easy to adjust as there is a button on the side that allows you to slide it between different sizes.  Overall, best power strip cover I've seen.	3
An expansion pack is essential as more and more games are coming out where you need to use the expansion pack.  The expansion pack improves graphics on games like South Park and Star Wars and is essential to play games like Zelda Majoras Mask and Perfect Dark.  The graphics are greatly improved that if you put two monitors together with one having a nintendo with an expansion pack and one without an expansion pack you would be able to see the difference.  Dont miss out on some of the best games about at the moment, buy an exoansion pack and enjoy	23
This game is really fun if you are just looking for some fun while you are bored,  but I can see why you wouldn't like it if you are a big backgammon gamer. The dice rolls are a tad bit unacerate considering doubles happen a lot. I am not a huge gamer when it comes to backgammon so I love this game and I play it all of the time! My advice is to get it and try it out. If you don't like it, I mean, it's free!! ;)	1
I get a lot of grease on my guitar from lotion, sweat, fingerprints, dust, what have you; I take some of this, spray it on a cloth, give it some elbow grease, and my guitars are shiny as the day it was made. I use it on my acoustic and electric guitars. The bottle lasts pretty long cause the mist is pretty fine. I use two sprays on the cloth for the front side of the guitar and then repeat for the back. It has a fresh lemon scent. I recommend this to everyone, a lot of product for an affordable price.	16
It was entertaining, and yes having lived in Southern Ohio for a while after moving their from a city out west, yes there are people like this everywhere in the country.  These people are horrid, but their story is interesting.  It is a depiction of poverty, and people living in coal country that live off the government SSI systems due to their mental illness.  They are crazy, take drugs, their children are hooligans, some are in jail/prison.  You just can't look away from this train wreck.  It reminded me of the show Justified, but this is reality for these people.	0
Never having been particularly interested in all things circus-y, I put this book back on the bookstore shelf more than once. But an Amazon review of another, quite unrelated novel referenced this book so I picked up a copy. Really glad I did. This is a well-paced novel that doesn't fall into the trap of doubling as a documentary on the early twentieth century circus trade. It is engaging, romantic, with sufficient drama and excitement to keep the pages turning over well into the night. Maybe at times a little cute, but a solid four-star effort.	5
This would have been a very good version of Jane Eyre except for the terrible miscasting of Mr. Rochester. Mr. Hinds simply isn't a romantic lead in any way, shape or form and his Rochester is nowhere near adequate. Its so distracting that I just couldn't believe the relationship between them. Jane wasn't plain enough for the role. Excellent actress though. The role of Jane calls for an actress that can look really drab most of the time then glow with animation at other times which changes her whole face.	15
If this is your first headset or you don't plan to have heavyuse, this is as good as it gets. ...the sound quality is goodand it is relatively comfortable. However, if you are going to spend time with this, the Plantronics M175 by far worth the additional expense. Much more invisible from the stand point of the user (you completely forget its on your head) and the listener on the other end. I have them both and switch to the Plantronics unit when I know it is going to be a long call or I going to be moving about.	10
When I was looking for a nice storage box for my front porch -- I ordered this product based on the other reviews.  They were right!  It WAS easy to put together.  Less than 2 minutes, no tools, no kidding.  It's very sturdy and doubles as overflow seating when necessary.  Very handy.  I even went back and ordered the larger one.  One note on the color:  It's more of a light taupe than the whiteish tone you see in the picture.  No matter. I highly recommend it.	18
"I have worn Keen sandals in the past and the first pair I owned was for hiking and kayaking in the Western States.  They are very durable and comfortable in most every situation.  I purchased this pair to have a ""dress"" pair of sandals that could be worn to outdoor get togethers in the heat of the summer.  The lining for your foot is very comfortable and the leather and construction seem to be top notch.  You spend more for these on the front end but will have years of enjoyment in wearing them."	8
"This Tasco scope came pre-mounted on a .308 caliber hunting rifle we recently bought and I have been impressed with the accuracy and quality of this bargain priced scope. The scope came ""bore-sighted"" so was on-paper at 100 yards and it was easy to get sighted in at 200 yards. The scope has held zero through multiple trips to the range and roughly 80 rounds or so. I really like the 3-9x zoom capability, which is perfect for the ranges this will be used.This is a good value for a reliable scope, recommended!CFH"	20
when moonwalker first came out...and just like millions of teens like me, i had to go and buy the vhs tape which i treasured.  but i have a feeling that moonwalker won't be on dvd for the u.s. anytime in the near future.  and who can blame michael??  i'm sure in other countries, his public image is a lot better than america when we have people like nancy grace trashing him on a daily basis.  but for 1988, this tape kicked [...]!!  and you def. got your $$ worth...but i would love to see it on dvd for the rest of us.	6
Largely a project of Paul McCartney's, (who was advised to junk it but refused) this hour long travelogue was savaged upon it's release to television.  Occasionally dull and more often than not disjointed, the musical sequences save the day, and you won't see a performance of &quot;I Am The Walrus&quot; anywhere else.  Film seems to hold up much better today in the age of music videos and as a landmark of 1960's psychadelia.  Beatle fans and 1960's buffs are sure to enjoy this more than a casual viewer.	6
I had forgotten about this fun and frivilous film until I caught the end of it on a retro Tv station.  I ordered it, watched it and loved it.  It's no Academy award winner (well it is, for Best Song- Last Dance), but you'll have fun watching it.  It's sort of a poor man's 70s version of American Graffiti and includes several future stars  including Jeff Goldblum and Debra Winger along with appearances by the Commodores and Donna Summer.  Put it on, put your brain on hold and just have fun reliving some good times.	15
Our betta seems to really like these worms, although he has never refused food. We give him micro pellets and once a week we feed him a quarter of a pea to clean out his system. Added these blood worms to vary his diet a little bit. I'm afraid to touch the worms. The first day I had them, I think I inhaled some dust from the container and my throat was itchy and swollen for a while. Make sure to use tweezers or some other instrument to pick up the worms.	19
Trite and repetitive - why do gay novels generally tend to be little more than a series of strung togther sex scenes with little narrative content ad even less literary value.  Come on guys we deserve better than this.  The theme of issues of being openly gay in sport is raised but the the novel closes before the consequences of being out are seen and the story developed.  Mills and Boon for gay men with sex included!  An hour's read at best with little characterisation or story outside the sex scenes.	14
With two such fine performers as Ciaran Hinds and Samantha Morton, and with Charlotte Bronte's masterful story, I could not believe that this version of Jane Eyre would be anything but enjoyable.  Sadly, I was disappointed.  I think the problem lies with the screenplay. A complex story was reduced to 2 hours, which meant that key plot and character development had to be sacrificed.  Hinds and Morton just did not have enough to work with.  Stick with the Timothy Dalton version, it is far better.	15
Lords of Waterdeep is by far one of my favorite board games. It's a worker placement type game, that is great for 2-5 players. This game is set in the Dungeons and Dragons universe, and while knowledge of the history is nice in that it would will let you recognize more of the land marks, it is not at all necessary to enjoy the game. I've played lots of worker placement games, and this remains one of my favorites as it's a solid middle ground, between rules heavy, and rules light. I highly recommend this board game.	22
I'm torn on my opinion about this book which I just finished last night.  I loved the parts where Jacob was old; it successfully portrayed the anguish and confusion anyone would feel when their independence, privacy, and basically their rights are taken away from them. I really felt it.  The story grabbed me right away and continued to be enjoyable and interesting through about half the book; then it deteriorated a bit after that.  All in all though I enjoyed the book and the characters and am not sorry I read it.  Definitely easy reading.Laura	5
What a disappointment. This was released as a concert movie back in the seventies, and the sound is worse than any theater you could imagine. The film is grainy, and the extras negligible. Rhino should do us a real service and find either a master negative for a reissue, or get the rights to the ABC special that aired right when the album &quot;Welcome To My Nightmare&quot; was released. It was a long form video years before MTV. Unless you're a diehard Alice Fanatic, take a pass and move to the better &quot;Brutally Live.&quot;	6
The downside is that it is quite heavy, though that can be a advantage to keeping the saw stable when starting a cut.  The aluminum base seems very rigid and gives confidence on keeping the cut on course.  Nice hard case with space for a few additional blades though you have to be careful stowing the cord to keep it away from the blade.  Hard case is much better than the bags supplied with my other DeWalt purchases.  Warning - no fence is included - you have to buy the over-priced $20 DW3278 fence separately.	21
This is one of my most favorite teas. I brew a cup of this almost every night and add a little bit of half and half. It has a nice light licorice flavor and the stevia in it adds the perfect amount of sweetness. Everyone I've made it for loves it, too. Even my sister in law who hates anise flavored things. And it really does seem to work. :) Also this is a great value. Especially if you get it on subscribe and save with enough stuff for 15% off.	11
We bought 3 originally and when one was washed it had a hole in it instantly and I could see why.  These are not the most durable covers made.  So, we bought cradle size lap pads and keep one over the cover.  It works wonderfully and is easy to pick up and put in the hamper if it gets dirty.  Plus, they are cheaper.  So, we have the nice clean look of a white cover and put the lap pad over top of it.  Works great!	3
I first would like to say that this should have been a five star review, because the storyline and plot are good......but, with so many errors I gave it three. Ms. Giovanni, I must say that first and foremost I'm an avid reader. Please don't take my review wrong, but the misspelled words and grammatical errors had me feeling some kinda way! I was pissed to say the least, you make money from writing, but your ripping off your customer's with this mess! I'll just leave it at that!	14
Alpha Hydrox might as well close it's doors.  I don't know what happened because twenty years ago they had amazing products for a cheap price.  Now they cost twice what they did then, understandable with inflation, but don't work worth a darn.  Yet another epic fail.  I am so disappointed in this product line.  I purchased several different products a few months ago and after finishing the bottles am still convinced they are absolute garbage.  They do not do what they claim but if you just want a lotion...here you go.  They are just like any other plain old lotion.	4
This is my favorite spatula of all time!  Very hard to find locally, it is the finest, thinest, and most flexible I have ever had, and others who have seen it in use in my kitchen all want one!  Even though it is so light and bends so well, it is well-attached to the handle, does not lose shape with time.  I highly recommend it, and its sister, the large OXO flexible turner, too!  Can't be beat, especially for fragile foods, like easy-over fried eggs, and thin cookies.	13
We owned our last blue babybjorn potty for over 10 years. It survived 4 children.  Unfortunately, it was accidentally cleaned with a substance that ruined the coating.We decided to go with a bjorn again and we are please with this one.  It is a large potty seat so this will fit a large child.  The white part removes easily so that it can be given a quick rinse.A child can lean back and not fall off the potty. The seat is big enough so a child can sit easily without hurting themselves.Overall, I am please with the purchase.	3
The GUI on this isn't the best, but it is pretty straightforward nonetheless. The only thing I would like to see added to this app is a way to do a one-touch download of all books purchased. I scanned through and ordered about 50 books from my computer, thinking they would automatically get sent to my tablet, but they didn't. The covers do, but then you hav eto go through one by one to download the books themselves. I'd rate 5 stars if not for this.	1
I bought this headphones from local storepairing is not hard with laptopthe control layout is a lot like Motorola HT820 (vol and call/power switch are on the left; play and prev/next are on the right)the RF is OK, pretty much like Logitechthe problem is sound in hifi mode, it sounds like CD player has Mega Bass turned on, bass is over-emphasized on some partthe headphone is pretty comfortable to wearI give score of 88/100, the sound in hifi mode is not good as expected, also, AVRCP is kinda sluggish	7
Dario Argento's 'Phenomena' is a a gem of a B-movie with enough engaging and entertaining characteristics to make this film well worth your time if you're into such genre novelties.  When you have a film that features a monkey sidekick, a crippled scientific genius, an all-girls boarding school in Europe, Jennifer Connelly in her teenage glory, insect swarms, rotting corpses and a few other surprises the question is - what doesn't this film have?  One of Argento's more entertaining films and a decent dvd to boot - lots of extras and an above average transfer.	15
We've played a few games of Fluxx and while it is easy to learn and play, it just isn't a very exciting game. The idea that the goal continually changes is neat, but it continually changes so often you really have no way to strategize. It ends up coming down to holding cards in your hand that you can't play so another player won't win, until you have to play something to end the game. Thankfully it wasn't very expensive. This is my first Fluxx style game but I assume all of them are very similar in nature.	22
After watching the first season I decided to see if the second season would be better. I was disappointed to find that it was just more of the same with the exception of adding a &#34;love&#34; interest, a member of the FBI, for Carter that just added  more sex into the fray. Story lines were the same. I can understand why it only lasted two seasons. However, if you like cop shows with sex, drugs and no &#34;rock and roll&#34; then watch Dark Blue.	0
Neither my wife nor I are into dark, grim crime and suspense shows. Not terribly keen, for example, on those CSI shows and coroner shows (though fond of Crossing Jordan, because the characters are so engaging). That's why our faves tend to be things like Monk and Psych and Remington Steele. White Collar's in that tradition of light-touch mystery suspense. The teaming of the master con man with the straightlaced FBI guy makes for a nifty dynamic with lots of potential for friendship and conflict. Just a lot of fun.	0
My vet uses these as treats to give to the dogs, which is where I noticed that he absolutely loved them.  He would let them poke and prod him if he thought he'd get one of these, so I had to get some for home.  Now, when I notice he's not behaving well before a walk, I'll keep some in my pockets while we're out and he listens very well.  He's constantly heeling when I do this (most likely because his nose is very near my pocket).	19
I am very pleased with the PQ on this BLU-RAY 3rd season of Supernatural. Howver, I cannot seem to get a menu of any kind, so once I put in the disc, I have to watch all the episodes in order... can't take a break or call up specific episodes... am I unique in this? do you other buyers share this? -  I hope the manufacturer will fix this for the other Blu-Ray seasons cause this sucks! Otherwise, I would have rated 5 stars...	0
An interesting mix of story, sayings, memoir and instruction..only the most ardent golfer or golf instructor could get much out of the instruction, but the story, sayings and memoirs are good, many outstandng.The concept of the Little Red Boook is interesing and alluring to the reader. An interesting mix of information. Well worth the read, but it leaves the reader--at least this reader--wishing it was two books, one of instruction, one on the other interesting and insightful informaton in the book.	5
I am replacing this headset (It replaced an Explorer 320) with a 510 because I am sick and tired of swivel earhooks getting loose and falling off-which is apparently NOT a warranty issue according to Plantronics. Their recommendation? Replace the headset. I ordered my 510 tonight-can't wait to replace this one. Note-it drops calls frequently, which I know is a cell-phone company issue because it happens with the phone too. But the swivel earpieces are ridiculous. I could have bought a 520 for $2 more but chose not to because of the SWIVEL!	7
This was a fast paced tale.  It started off so innocently in the Holy Land with a pleasant trip with just a hint of something wrong.  Greg's  senses were picking up little nuances, but couldn't quite put a finger on what was bothering him.  Just too many coincidences.  After they got home, the fun started.  With Jill kidnapped he had to pull out all the stops and call in every favor he could.  As this is the beginning of the series, it made you think a little harder.  Loved the relationship and the genuine love between them.  A great read.  Recommend reading all this series.	14
These wipers work, and they work really, really well.The package they are delivered in is easy to open. Securing the blades to the wiper arm on my car was very simple and easy as well.In terms of cleaning/wiping capability, they do great. Probably the best set of wipers I've ever had on a car, no lie. I used to love the RainX blades, but even out of the box there was a spot on my windshield where they would struggle. Not so with the Valeo,Highly recommended.	2
There are so many pros, so few cons to this gate.  It's tall, there's no way my 2-year-old can get over it.  Incredibly convenient swinging door.  If you follow the instructions on how to correctly tighten it on the door frame you won't have trouble.  I didn't do that the first time and I was getting frustrated.  The gate was smarter than me!My son, who is Mr. Motor Skills, cannot open it.Would make an excellent dog gate for small dogs.Sometimes the pedal can get sticky and you have to push on it a little harder, but that's really my only complaint.	3
This is a great air hose at an outstanding price.  It came packaged in a tight coil, but as soon as I opened it up, the hose uncoiled with ease.  The yellow rubber looks to be very durable and heavy-walled and the fittings are high quality brass coated.  You won't be able to find a better air hose at a box store for a price this good.  My only complaint is that I didn't purchase another one!If you're in need for a quality air hose for your compressor/air tools, you owe it to yourself to pick one (or two) up.	21
I have played quite a few games on this app. I also played on different apps. I liked the ease of the button format for several reasons. The pop up is a bit confusing until you are used to it. The &quot;see through&quot; pop up implys activity there is none, and also provides confusion in placement of notes. All in all it is not a bad format and may be preceded by some. However, if you just want a clean, clear cut board, then the button format is the way to go! ;)	1
I had stopped using Frontline a few years ago when it 'appeared' to stop being effective on my dogs. It was on sale a couple months ago so I tried it again. I don't what they did but I'd say it improved as I found no sign of ticks (or fleas) on the pets. We are heavy with them here in Maine in the fall and so far the Frontline is doing what it suppose to. As long as it does that and doesn't have an adverse effect (which can happen) on our pets we'll continue to use it..	19
I have had this phone for almost a year now. I have not had any major issues. Though a little slippery to hold. The bad part about the keyboard is that you have to use two hands for it. I have been reading about people losing their stylus', I haven't had that problem so far. I have added a 2GB mini SD card for my tunes. Although this phone does not like Macs, it is a good windows device which requires occasional reset. A built-in task manager would help.	7
I really enjoyed &#34;The Deafening.&#34;  I read it after reading another book by Itani which I really enjoyed.  Like most Americans I don't know as much about Canada as I should.  The novel grabbed my attention at the beginning and held it to the end.  It also made me feel so lucky that I have my hearing.  The scenes of the hardships of the men fighting WW1 were difficult to read, but that is war and I think it is something we all should think about.	5
I have this attached to a 2' Firestik on my Jeep and it seems to work just fine for our trail runs where we're within a mile of one another. I really don't use CBs for anything more -- like long-distance chatter with truckers and whatnot. It's got some cool features, but honestly, I haven't used them. Either way, this thing is good for what I use it for. Plus, when camping, we can go mobile with it. 10-4 good buddy.	10
Mr. Tim Roth drives this story line although Kellie Martin is probably meant to be a co star. The think I like most is that this is a intelligent TV series because you learn about people in our society who lie, and to some extent learn about reading people with whom you deal.  I first saw Roth in a Scottish film with Liam Neeson called where he held his own which is no easy task. The rest of the cast is alright but it is Roth who carries the film with his strutting and insights.	0
Having read reviews of several different live traps, had no idea which was best.  So, bought about 4 different ones.  THIS ONE WORKED.  Put them all out with peanut butter and had no sign of any activity except this one.  Didn't know how many mice we had, but caught three with this one and zero with the others and no escapes, it seems, from the others.  They were all put in the same general area.  This one worked, was easy to set, easy to bait and easy to release the mouse.	18
After having consistent problems with shops who say that they have done the work, only to find that my diff has not been serviced, I do my own work now.  It's not difficult on my vehicle, and I know it's being done right.  I've read up on different lubricants, and Royal Purple gets consistently high marks.I did a service recently and when I drained my diff after 15,000 miles, the Royal Purple looked like it did going in.  No breakdown, despite some pretty good use.	2
This series is really more like one long novel than a serialization. Again we find Lucky Jack Aubrey land bound and hoping for a command. Like in all the others he soon receives his hearts desire and the rest as they say is history. The semi accurate revisionist history is pleasing. The use of the archaic Royal naval jargon is like learning another language. If this installment we see more of Dr. Maturins true vocation as a spy. I highly recommend this installment to anyone who has read any of the past books.	5
"If you've seen Motley Crue's ""Uncensored"", it's somewhat similar to this one. ""Konfidential"", ""Unplugged"" and ""Kiss My A**"" should also be picked up. So far the footage alone makes this one worth getting over the others. If you loved the 80s era KISS along with seeing some vintage clips, this one's the one you want to pick up.I would love to see them put out a full length blown out video collection from over the years worthy of being a companion to the KISS box set including the original 4 playing the songs from ""Alive"" and ""Destroyer"" from beginning to end."	6
this is a game that is perfect it is so fun to play at times when the sun gos down u can do a lot of stuff in this game its very cool its got 20 hole hours of this game there are good ponits in this game very nice game GREAT MUSIC better then zelda 2 for the n64 this game has much more to have even if u think u have gotton all moneys and more u have much more for this game it is a must have n64 game lovers u will want this MASTER GAME for your system.	23
I've been using this for 1 and a half year.Batteries still charges fine and I can vacuum whole house (1200 sqft) with 2 batteries which comes with the vacuum.It's totally handy and vacuum well for hairs include pet's hairs which I really like it.It doesn't vacuum small rocks nor coins.The handle and the tank became really flimsy after a year of use. the dust tank doesn't fit to the body anymore, so it falls off easily.I am thinking to purchase the different vacuum soon.I hope this review helps :)	13
This is, by far, Too Short's best album.  The whole thing is full of his unique, laid back flow and Yay Area beats.  IN THE TRUNK and I AIN'T NOTHIN' BUT A DOG are the best songs, epitomizing Short's lifestyle.  IN  THE TRUNK has the funkiest beat, and the bass...you get submerged in it.  The production on the whole album is tight and Short Dog lays it all out  for the world to see:  the Oaktown lifestyle.  He's an Oakland Vet and  wants everybody to know it.  This is a no compromise album and one of the  best in my collection.	9
I had my doubts when I bought these earrings.  I've not had much luck in buying jewelry on line.  I was always disappointed with my purchases--cheap, tinny and badly made.  So when I opened the little velvet bag they came in and pulled them out, I was amazed at the brilliance of the stones and the delicacy and quality of the silver settings.  I will buy another pair as a holiday gift.  No disappointments here . . . I have already worn them several times.	8
I love this stuff. Never having regular BM's I started with 1 tea bag and by the next morning I would go. then I started to see that 1 tea bag wasn't doing anything, so I upped it to 2 tea bags..bam! Got the results I wanted...sometimes if I got really backed up or ate a ton of crap over the weekend or something and needed to clear out, I do 3 bags. I am also 6ft tall and weight 230lbs. I wouldn't suggest 3 teabags to my tiny friends unless you wanted to really punish somebody!	11
This has everything you'd expect in an Argento film:  a wide range of  acting quality, characters who say and do things that don't make sense  considering their situations, a muddled mystery, great-looking women (i.e.  victims), colorful and stylish photography, special makeup effects which  are only sometimes effective, and great murder setpieces. I actually jumped  twice which is two more times than when watching most recent horror movies.  Somehow it all works out to an enjoyable DVD. Nice widescreen transfer,  minimal extras.	15
I had mediocre expectations when I went to see this move, I just didn't want to get my hopes up for a fantastic movie and then have it be a let down. But I was extremely pleasantly surprised with the movie. It was well made, well filmed, gave us marshmallows the answers we've been dying for, and had some great suspense scenes. I was so happy that I made the commitment to this movie that I did, and can't wait to own it so I can watch it again and again!	0
It was Christmas gift for my youngest grandson (8). Before purchasing I checked detailed reviews about indoor helicopters and this type Gyro and metal had the best rating. I am happy that I followed reviews and purchased this helicopter, because it's easy to fly when used by older brothers, but the youngest one is getting there too. The flight is perfectly balanced and the metal material makes it more resistant to damaging upon eventual crashing or hitting other objects.  Also, in the case of damaging they sell parts for replacement. It was excellent gift. It's fascinating watching such little thing flying.	22
"I was looking for Lemongrass ""tea"" without the tea (green, white, decaf or otherwise)--just basic lemongrass in tea bags.  This is it!  The flavor is lemony without being harsh.  Very smooth, silky and pleasant while at the same time delivering rich, full-bodied flavor.I find it relaxing, easy on the stomach, nice right before bedtime or first thing in the morning.One warning, however: Lemongrass in any form--including teas, spices and foods--is NOT recommended for those who are pregnant or breast-feeding. Details at Webmd"	11
I was hoping to use this in the non-fenced part of our yard, since that is where the deer shred our flowers.Be warned, if a bird alights on this, they will get a shock. If a fox or dog sniffs it, they too will get a shock.Not to mention children, and since we don't have a fence in the front, children do cut through out yard.So, maybe if you live out in the country this would be useful.  But if you live in the city and you don't have a fence and there are children around...	18
I don't have any complaints about this product yet, but I've only been using it for the past couple months. It is great for mixing anything. I love the rubber bottom to keep it from sliding. Sometimes I mix things while I walk around the kitchen, or since I'm short, I often put it on my lap to get better leverage, so it's great that this bowl doesn't add much weight. It is great that this is made out of plastic to keep it light-weight and relatively shatter-resistant (vs. glass/ceramic).	13
This Game is a good game depending on your personality.  If you like to drive around in a car in  New  York City or shooting up alien invaders,in other words you like games with a lot of action, then this is probably not the game for you.  there is no action, or enemies.  Myst is more of exploring and puzzle solving.  It requires quite a bit of patience to play.  If your looking for an adventure/puzzle game then you should get myst. in my opinion it is a great game.  one of the best i have ever played	23
My rating for this product is at a solid 4.5. The capacity is very close to advertised, but works hard to recharge my Nook Color at 4000mAh@3.7V. The unit is mostly used as a desk charger for my wife's Iphone 4S when at work (teacher), and performs that task perfectly! The build quality is as expected. The functionality and directions are easy to use, and as expected. Recharge time does vary depending on the AC/USB Converter, but the item does get a full charge as expected.	7
A good short story for a reasonable price. Other reviewers have provided the story line, I'd add that I liked McTark's inventiveness in the sex scenes, with a tinge of exhibitionism. Good chemistry between Brian and Amber, their characters had enough depth to make me care about them. The misunderstanding between them was a little out of character for Brian, but you gotta have some angst tension for a good story. I could have used a little more background on Brian. How is a nice, hot, hunky, hung guy like Brian not married or at least involved?	14
This is one of the better acne products out there. I use it almost everyday to gently exfoliate and clean my skin. Some people, like my brother, prefer the large beads in a facial scrub, but I like the smaller beads in this one. Because the beads are finer, it feels like it's exfoliating more evenly. It can also be used in combination with other products, where as other facial scrubs might be too harsh for combination with anything else in the day. I would recommend trying it out; It's effective, cheap, and the tube lasts for a really long time.	4
A great, clean look for the otherwise ugly string guide clamps. The guides on these are not rollers, but are the next best thing visually and performance wise in my opinon.  The only guides that I like better are the round 50's guides for Tele's, but then I like those asthetically only on Tele's.  An inexpensive mode that looks and works great.  To the inexperienced eye this simple, clean looking mod can make a Mexican or Chinese instrument look more like the made in America models.	16
I got tired of hearing my boyfriend complain of never having clean underwear so as a sorta gag gift I got him a variety of different brands. So for a week he was getting underwear from amazon with a gift note&#8230; it made for an amusing week of texts. But he did fall in love with the ExOfficio. He loved the fabric and I end up buying him more because I&#8217;m just awesome like that (and because he seemed to only wear one pair&#8230;) So I will recommend them on his behalf.	8
For the past 4 months I have been eating healthy. Everything from having no artificial sweeteners to recording every calorie and nutrient I eat.  After doing hours of research I came to the conclusion all natural honey needed to be introduced to my diet. I was very impressed!!! I typically make a fresh ground almond butter sandwich add bananas, and this honey and it tastes great!Taste: AMAZINGPrice: Not bad, because it lasts a LONG LONG time. You wont use much at a time.Health: VERY GOOD FOR YOUOverall, I would but it again!	11
These perches are great!  They make a lot of room and are very comfortable for my birds.  You can position these perches in any direction, any place.  They don't have to be straight.  This  gives them more room and in different directions.  It's great!!!! I have several different size cages.  These perches come in different sizes and can be used in any size cage.  You can pick any space you feel would be great for your bird(s) to feel comfortable and twist the perch. All the cages have these perches!	19
This release reflects the creative minded artist roster that STAX created during it's heyday. The concept was right and the music is quite inspiring on this collection,theirs not much that can be said that has'nt already about this 1970 classic,however I would like to add that although Booker T Jones was and still is one of the grooviest Hammond B-3 players around he is also a very underrated Blues Pianist as he has displayed throught his career. Anyone interested in more STAX should check out oneline(or visit as I have) the STAX museum in Memphis,check out their website.	9
This is the second time I put this in my old car (1997 Honda Accord). It improve the shiftly slight faster than before  and I can feel the torque is better too. On the pass, it take long while before the car can pick up. Now, I can feel better pulling. Finally, I have to send my car to my mechanic to have valve tune up. Because it haven't done any tune up for over 100,000 miles. Let me check it out are there better return, I shall keep post for any one who are interest on it. Thanks	2
nice app, glad i got it while it was freex, but i still would have paid for it.if you want better reviews then go to the android market, most of the reviews give this app 5 stars, so i do not understand the negative reviews, those stupid people probably have a really crappy phone that cannot run anything and they are just whiny babies. i tell you the day the faotd has no 1 star reviews, is they day i win the lotto......come on amazon, change the age to be able to review.	1
This short (13 episodes) first season of Lie To Me was a big surprise to me. The show format and concept of the stories are not particularly groundbreaking, but good scripts, superb acting and a likeable ensemble cast make it above average (in my opinion).Kelli Williams is simply breathtaking as Dr. Gillian Foster. She's gorgeous, mature, self-assured without being cocky. Tim Roth, that did not need to prove anything, once again show his talent.This is the kind of DVD set to watch in one week maximum!I don't know why Season One was so short.	0
"This saw is awesome. Took it out for it's first use today. Great power on demand at the push of a button, no worries about gas or oil, just the lube the chain and you're good to go. Sliced through moist maple like butter. Handled branches up to 8"" with ease. It did, however, throw its chain after an hour of use, which was entirely my fault; do what you're supposed to, and adjust the tension are the new chain has warmed up (and therefore expanded!) a bit. A great, versatile tool!"	18
Final Fantasy: The Spirits Within, was released in 2001.When I watched that video game movie, I could not believe how realistic it was.There is no salvation for T4 or this game. They are both mundane & trite.They took no time to doctor up this movie. The chapters are short. The video is grainy & flawed, just like a video game, only not as engaging.You would have to be a machine to enjoy this movie.:(FF is still on my shelf. Salvation is going bye bye ...	0
I got this game because every person said it was the best game ever. For 1998 it is, but now it's just good. Not as good as wind waker or twilight princess. The level design is good. Parts are 3d, others are resident evil camera. In short it works okay, but I screwed up many times becaus of it. the graphics were good several years ago, but now they are muddy and polygonal. Aside from that, it's zelda. Nothing new. If you buy it, don't expect it to live up to all the hype.	23
I was feeling nostalgic so I bought this game along with a few others to relive my childhood. It's as much fun as I remember! There's always plenty to do, from finishing levels to completing timed flight races. Even if you beat the final boss in the game, you can keep playing to collect all the gems and find all the dragons. Once you do that, you get to open up new content! Even at 100% complete, there's STILL more to do, not to mention the replayability of the game is superb. Definitely worth the buy!	23
This novel is really interesting in that it explores the world of circus performers in the post depression era of the U.S.  The details are amazing and it is obvious the author took great care to create an authentic feel for the time period and life of circus performers.  A passionate love story is revealed that will capture your heart.  The reflections of an old man in the story tie it all together with wonderful sensitivity and charm.  I thought the title was really creative. I became immersed in the circus world with ease while enjoying this engaging novel.	5
We have a Bed & Breakfast with a Meeting/Seminar Center.This is the exact name brand item we could buy in stores and I have bought these for years for meetings.  They are excellent and inexpensive.We buy this item on Amazon.com because we live in a remote area of Montana and shopping is 60 miles one-way away (besides, the prices are up to 40% higher and with Amazon delivering FREE to our door within 48 hours, why go anywhere else?)Anyway, these are the same name brand I have bought elsewhere for a lot more and they are excellent.	17
Just really great Feedback from my buddy who received this Ironman watch for his BD gift, from me..I picked this watch, because of it's unique features, ratings and the fact that it first caught my eye, when I saw it featured in a movie. In the movie, it was worn by Will Ferrell, in 'Stranger Than Fiction'.Feedback is:* Stainless Steel bracelet > Solid feeling!* Functions in Dual Mode, LED + Sweep Hands* Large number digits, easy to see* Silent Blue Glow Light alarm, Extra Cool!* H2O proof* May be worn as a dress timepiece	8
I think very good for using a hand mixer.  They have the rubber side that you grip, and the substantial rubber-like base that really holds the bowl firmly against the table. IT does not appear to me that the rubber base will separate from the bowl (a good thing). Bowl itself is solid, substantial plastic that appears to be durable quality material.  And the grip is nice, a nice way to hold the bowl while mixing. I expect that you will want all three sizes after purchasing one size.	13
Pros:Excellent design.  Sliding cover is designed to let you dispense cubes one at a time. To loosen the cubes just run water over the bottom and shake the tray while locking cover is completely on.Cons:A little bigger than the basic ice cube trays.  Design does not consider limited freezer space/s.  I started filling the tray only halfway to get smaller cubes.  I used to bartend so I wish the ice cubes were half the size just like in bars and nightclubs.If you hear of same in smaller size alert me by commenting on my review.	13
I found two young female cats wondering around my neighborhood and eventually caught them, their fur was rough and dirty from malnourishment and the harsh weather. After a bath and some good science diet cat food, they're as healthy as can be! Their fur is soft and their teeth are so healthy! I also leave a bowl of science diet cat food for the other two feral cats that don't want to be caught. I will not be taking my two new kitty cats off this food, they love it to much!	19
I'm not sure if it's because I'm used to foam, but this product doesn't do it for me. I was very disappointed. I should state however that I have a very clear youthful complexion with combination skin.  I think this would work well for those with dry skin because it feels a little too heavy after washing with mine.  It does feel silky but like I said for someone with combination skin it might be too greasy/heavy. I feel like I'm wearing makeup. I'm certain that if my skin was dry I would love it though.	4
I bought this because of the deal and dewalt name.  Turns out the item does not operate at a consistent level as far as screw depth.  You may get one or two perfect then a bunch that are not sunk in the dimple.  Bad product.If you buy one of these, try it!  Don't let it set around like I did and get past the return date.  Fairly obvious that whoever had it before me realized it would not work consistantly, and returned it.My bad!  Found out after asking on a DIY forum that the dewalts are know for this inconsistency!	21
I grew up playing Mortal Kombat. I was a fan of the series up to it's 3D debut, when it really began spiraling down-hill. Soul Calibur is the first 3D fighter that I felt is worth the buy. It has a deep storyline, as deep as fighting games get. It includes TONS of secrets that can be accessed by playing through the games on various modes. The graphics are the best you can find on ANY system. Buy the game if you even remotely like fighting games. If you don't... what is wrong with you?	23
I wouldn't rate this as a baby necessity. It was nice to have at times, but our baby was never really addicted to it. I used the sounds as background noise when she was an infant, but not all the time. I was afraid she would get hooked on sleeping with white noise and wouldn't sleep any other way. The light was very helpful. I used that all the time for middle-of-the-night nursing sessions. It is very dim, so it is not bright enough to realy wake up baby (or you!) but you can see enough to avoid fumbling around.	3
Jeff Daniels does a lot of movies, spanning a lot of types of roles.  But believe me... it's hard to believe that this is the same guy who played in Dumber & Dumber.  THIS is a man playing GEORGE WASHINGTON... and while I'm in no way a history buff, I LOVE his portrayal of General Washington, and the whole story of the Deleware crossing, and how that one tiny thread of incredibly fated success turned the whole tide of the Revolutionary War.  Awesome movie... awesome acting... and not typical for the types of movies he plays.The on-line purchase experience was excellent.  :-)	15
Couldn't find this in stores around my area. But I've used this before and they're great. It's convenient and it minimizes the need for a lot of bottles and best part is they're disposables. I never had problems with this drop-in liners before although I did read another review that there's another liner that can be used with the drop-in nurser bottles, just as good if not more effective, cheaper and more count. Regardless, this has my stamp of approval and I would recommend this for new parents.	3
I'm a bit disappointed in how low of a maintenance voltage it keeps.  This is likely intentional so the charger does not 'cook' the electrolyte.I needed a charger to replace the one I used to use in combination with my desulfator (a home built one, though not by me), and desulfators thrive when there is a tiny bit over overcurrent.Others mention the fan, and yeah, you can hear this one.  While I have a bit of concern that'll be the first item to fail, it should be simple to replace for almost no cost.	2
This trap is dangerous....and not only for mice!It's a slightly better design than the all wood and wire cheapies that spring either when you look at them, or not at all.It's easy to smear peanut butter on the plastic 'cheese' holes, but be careful setting the trap. Right now my middle finger has a blood blister from getting caught as it snapped while getting the stabilizing bar in the right position.I'm not complaining too much, however, as it shows that it snaps with enough force to kill quick and clean. Probably more humane than poison.	18
Of all the battery chargers on the market, the Battery Tender is the best.  The device is small and portable, works exceptionally well for maintaining batteries and does not over charge (over charging can decrease the overall life of your battery).  It is simple to operate and can be left hooked up to a dormant battery while it is not in use.  The Battery Tender can be used while the battery is hooked up to a vehicle/mower/etc. or not.  Highly recommended. I comparison shop a lot before buying anything - hopefully you can benefit from my time investment and review.	2
Still fresh from the success of her breakout hit 'Happy Ever After' a year earlier, this sophomore album sees Fordham in fine form as she doles out her smooth-as-chocolate Brit soul with her indescribably warm pipes...She also betrays signs of her jazz roots in 'Your Lovely Face' and 'China Blue', as well as toying with bossa nova beats in 'Genius' (the lyrics read like a follow-up to 'Happy Ever After' with her concern for all that's wrong with the environment).A great album to listen with the lights turned down, and cool drink in hand.	9
This a fine quality machine. It really is very basic and quite simple in its design. Although not as refined as some sanders out there this unit does one thing well. SAND.The ability to adjust the speed is a must on any sander.This tool will easily withstand the daily rigors of loading and unloading your work truck.I do recommend upgrading the sanding shoe and I wish porter cable offered that as a standard.From the rugged american craftsmanship to its simplicity and fair price this tool is a big hit.Two thumbs up on this one.Now get out there and sand something.	21
I bought the complete UD series some 5 years ago and the money that I paid was well worth it. I will not buy the 40th Anniversary series because the extras the set offers can be seen on You Tube. If you have never bought the complete set,and have never seen UD, I suggest that you invest the money for this great piece of television history. You will not regret it. British drama is the best there is. The writers and production values are magnificent. I can understand why this program crosses all cultural lines.	15
This device has so many uses whether it comes to mixing audio for a presentation, a gaming video, or playing musical instruments. There are so many controls and this mixer has just enough inputs/outputs/controls for just about anything that I've been using it for. It seems to be very durable as well. It does seem to get hot after a while, but that hasn't affected it's use at all and so far hasn't damaged the device in any way. Behringer is the way to go!	16
I never expected this scanner to be so great. I pick up police, fire, EMS, railroads.....from my area and from several different states as well. And the reception is super clear. I bought a scanner for a few hundred dollars last year and returned it - it was terrible. But this free app on my Kindle Fire picks up everything and all I have to do is type in a city name or county! Easy, fun and free. No trouble with installing it or using it at all.I highly recommend it.	1
"My keys, ids & cards, and iphone fit great in here.  Could probably put a gel pack or 2 in there as well.  I like that it has 2 compartments so I can separate my keys or anything that might scratch the screen of my phone.  However, it stays tight enough so I don't feel the contents moving around enough for that to really happen, but just in case.Fit fine on me and my waist size is about 36.  The straps felt like they could easily go up to 42"" waist and down into the 20""s too."	20
Incredible.  If you have never seen Stomp live, then do it!  If that is impossible, then watch this video.  These masters of rhythm are awesome.  Whether they have a basketball, a broom, or a butcher knife in their hands, they create drama, energy and excitement through rhythm!  There are segments in this video that could not be performed live.  That is a bonus!  Also, the short documentary about &quot;Stomp&quot; is incredible!  My children love this as well.  Great for the whole family!	6
as usual, i order a cd like 'protection' for a song or two.  then i get a great surprise.in this case, it's the title track, with vocals by tracey thorn.  thorn, along with lisa gerrard, dusty springfield, doris day, billie holiday, aretha franklin and a few others, has a uniquely gorgeous voice and styling that is immediately identifiable for so many things--a social scene, a certain era, a mood.unlike the others, she has still to get her due and fame as a singer.  here's hoping that people will use her and get her heard as much as the law will allow.	9
I never thought Enya would reach the sublime heights of Evacuee or Marble Halls from 'Shepherd Moons.' 'The Celts, Watermark and Day...' were all pleasant and admirable throughout, but are less ambitious both lyrically and musically. But Hope Has a Place from 'Memory...' reaches those heights and beyond. It is Enya at her most inspirational and comforting. I'm actually glad that this song didn't get overexposed the way Only Time did. It makes it that much more special to all who own this album.	9
"I always order Purina Pro Plan cat food from Amazon, as with Amazon Prime I receive prompt two day service with no shipping cost.  I am handicapped and cannot get out to shop and this is a tremendous asset to me!!HOWEVER, this order was shipped incorrectly....instead of one ""Salmon"" and 1 ""Chicken"", I received two bags of ""Chicken with Rice"". As it is too difficult for me to return one, can you send 1 ""Salmon"" at N/C or a reduced rate to compensate for the inconvenience"	19
Mine arrived in perfect condition.  This clamp is very well made and worked just like I had hoped.  Jorgensen makes a nice product here, and this type of clamp is really useful for many jobs around your wood shop.  I purchased this one to use with the Incra I-box jig (reviewed separately) that I got to make box joints, and it is a must for that application.  This type of clamp has many other applications too, so as a relatively novice woodworker I plan to buy more of this type of Jorgensen clamp in various sizes.	21
These clips are excellent.  They won't change your life, but they're extremely handy.  They are quite well-made.  They last, and they maintain a tight grip rather than losing their &quot;spring&quot; after repeated use.  Also, the relatively wide and flat surface on the business end does a better job than most alternatives at holding closed a wide-mouthed bag of pretzels, chips, etc.  The bright colors are also attractive, and the fact that they double as refrigerator magnets is a nice twist.	13
This is the best racing game i've ever played and the most funest. The game has a cool unique to a racing game. it is tons of fun, and you can play either Mario, Luigi, Peach (The Princess), Toad, Yoshi, Bowser(King Koopa) & Donkey Kong. There are three types of trophies you can recieve, either the Mushroom trophy, Flower Trophy, Star Trophy and A Special Trophy. Cool Hu. Well this game was tons of fun i recomend it to everyone. Peace OutIf you liked this game then check out all of the Mario Games.	23
I bought this to mount on my muzzle loader. It has the ideal magnification for deer hunting in heavy cover where things tend to get up-close and personal.  At the price I paid I didn't expect to get much more than the minimum.  This scope is much better than the minimum.  Light transmission and clarity are way above average.  The size is just right and the build quality is terrific.  My boom stick kicks like a mule but the scope hold it's zero tenaciously. I wish I needed two.	20
Our picky cat REALLY likes this stuff.  One problem was he was forever wanting more. We don't feed it to him always but its great to mix with other food he likes less. It seems to set well with him - we have to watch his food as he's had urinary and hairball issues.  We've tried other stuff he doesn't like and his tastes seem to change every 4-8 months so we switch around a lot.  Tried this one and we'll buy more to add to the rotation.	19
Sometimes I wonder what goes through the mind of Marilyn Manson. What powers from the depths of hell created this band?! I swear I have never seen a nastier artist than Marilyn Manson. Not even Slayer was as nasty as  this guy. Believe me, one look at the video &quot;Sweet Dreams(are made of  this)&quot; scared the living hell out of me. I'd rather be watching videos  from the Aphex Twin master &quot;Richard D. James&quot;. If you plan to  watch this video.......well, don't say I didn't warn you.	6
As has been said over and over again by many other reviewers, I feel this is the best Wu-Tang album, solo or as a group, period.GZA is the best lyricist of the group.  He has a great delivery and writes great lyrics.It also has the best atmosphere in creating what the Wu-Tang wanted to be about: kung-fu vintage clips; Rza's razorsharp beats; great lyrics and great songs.This is the best album that the Wu-Tang ever dropped, so it's surprising that it is generally overlooked.	9
Makes level soooo easy. When I bought this I thought it seas just a simple bubble level. It is, but it is marked in inches of level error, so hat makes it super easy to level in one shot.  For example, it might show 3&#34; of &#34;unlevel&#34;, so you just use two 2x6 or 2 plastic leveling blocks and its right every time. We toured the entire US and stopped at more than 100 RV parks and campsites. I never one try to get the level right ( except when I put the blocks on the wrong side ! )	2
I'll tell you, I sure wouldn't want the main character in this show to interview ME. He'd see every little quirk and foible and end up reading me like a book. That, of course, is why he makes such a great &#34;detective.&#34;  Almost nobody can get past him. Tim Roth is brilliant and so are the scripts. Too bad it lasted only 3 seasons. But that's like 50 episodes of terrific mystery-suspense. If you haven't checked it out, get on the ball and do so.	0
"Yes, it is cheesy,more than a tad goofy but I still find a soft spot for this picture.  I first saw it at a theatre in Minneapolis when it was released and while, ok, it is a combination of JAWS, DUEL and something ripped out of Hell.  Great to see it out in a dvd better than the previous edition (and at a nice price -- unlike the out of stock version).  If you are looking for something meaningful to watch -- this ain't it.  Still as Howard Hawks (or was it John Ford?) once said, ""Messages are for Western Union."""	15
This season is really underrated in my opinion.  It has some of my favirote episodes in it like the three part Coon and Friends episode.  The commentary is also great, because Matt and Trey finally explain more about Kenny's awareness of his deaths and immortality.  I just love the whole comic book vibe of these three episodes and how all the kids have their own super hero persona. This blu-ray has some funny deleted scenes too and a bonus episode of the original Coon episode. If you're a South Park fan then this is a must have for your collection.	0
I'm a pretty good cook.  I have a lot of kitchen gadgets and tools, but I never used a flat whisk before -- just made things work with a traditional balloon whisk.I love this flat whisk when I'm making a sauce/gravy/reduction in a large pan.  It works better than any balloon whisk for blending and breaking down thickeners or solids.  The handle fits well in my average-sized hand and the Good Grips feature is always a plus.  OXO -- I haven't gone wrong with your brand yet.	13
Since other reviewers gave info about the plot, I will just stick to my impressions about the read.  This was a free book on Kindle which is a prequel to a series which I have not read.  This story was a very quick read, and the main characters were not especially engaging to me.  I liked the premise of the story with the spirit animal guides, and the special abilities which they conferred on the characters.  While I found this book to be somewhat entertaining, I haven't decided yet if I like the writing well enough to purchase the next book in the series.	14
its great in that it remembers what you search for, keeps track of past workouts, and the likes, but wont give credit for calories burned during weight training. at all. there isnt even a spot to enter the calories burned if you knew how many. but what about those of us who dont have all this info burned into our brains? I am over on calories several days straight because it doesnt want to give credit for my weight training. how is this going to help me lose weight?	1
Whenever I want to buy a book from Amazon, I use my Kindle app. I now buy all my books that way.  For example, I have been steadily working my way through Ken McClure's medical thrillers at $5 per book (out of print every way but Kindle for his older books).  It has been a great reading experience.  Ironically, I use my Kindle app more than my sister uses her actual Kindle.  I've also read ebooks on Good Reader and iBooks.  I'd say Kindle holds its own with both of those.	1
Our family loves hiking.  We all have an appropriate pair of these socks.  Living in a very hot climate, these socks do get a little warm.  However, price and quality make these socks a worthwhile purchase.I've even been known to wear these as my work socks.  As someone who works in a school and is on his feet most of the day, these socks are both confortable and stylish enough for daily wear.I would like to be able to compare them against another brand which claims to be cooler.	8
Not sure if this really gets mosquitoes.  It does kill everything else. It is like a redneck carnival outside!  It goes crazy the first few nights it is outside and then tapers off.  So it does a good job of keeping bugs down.  Unfortunately it kills good bugs and pesky bugs.I bought the mosquito sent, but they don't stay stuck to the bottom well.  There is not enough surface area for the sticky part to adhere to.It is also pretty bright.  I had to close the blinds at night as it lite up the whole room.	18
Got this for cleaning out sport bottles and stainless thermal coffee cups.  Flexible.  The bristles are not very dense and the bristle material is very light.  This is NOT a scrub brush, and I actually have concerns about how long the lightweight nylon bristles will hold up over time, but this gets the job done.  The brush will fit into anything the width of the wand portion at the top, because the bristles are so soft, they flatten out and flow (almost like wet hair...).	12
I've been using this stuff for YEARS.  It works great, it prevents the &#34;fogging&#34; on windshields, and it lasts a good long time.  And since it's not silicone based, it's not one of those cheap products that just shines up the surfaces, and dries them out so they crack.  Over years of applications in several cars an in the house, I've never had cracking issues.It will never provide a super shiny surface like the cheaper competitors, but that's not what it's for.  It's for cleaning AND protecting the surfaces.	2
This is one of those rare books that draws you in and keeps you, even if you don't normally read this type of story.  The writing is poetic, yet simple enough to not be confusing, nor overly flowery.This is the second book I've read by this author, and I have found it to be true for both so far.  I'd recommend getting any and all of his books that you can.Frankly, it's rare that I find a guy so able to write from a girl's perspective at times, and get it right.Thank you, and again...loved it.  :D	14
I finally got around to installing this thing, 4 months after I purchased it.It works very well for use in a 25 foot travel trailer, moves a lot of air and has 3 settings.High setting is loud, but not nearly as loud as an air conditioner.This is the basic non remote control model which is a bit cheaper.The product is sturdy and assembled easily. Not a bad do-it-yourself project.It took the greater part of a morning to remove the old fan and install this one.	2
When I have trouble winding down, I make myself this tea. It has stevia in it, so once I weaned myself off of needing REALLY SWEET tea, I realized that I don't need to add anything to it. The longer it steeps, the better it tastes. This is what started my love affair with Yogi teas. It's usually about $4.50 a box in the grocery stores (DC area, so your mileage may vary), so the subscribe and save option on here, or even just getting one six pack, is a HUGE savings. Highly recommended.	11
This is a great idea! You have cases for phones so why not have one for your bluetooth. I have a Motorola HS850 earpiece and wanted to make sure that I would not lose or misplace it. This holder clips on to my car visor or my purse so it is handy. It fits my earpiece perfectly. I got one for my husband and brother for their bluetooth. You can't beat the quality or the price. I definitely recommend this for anyone that has an earpiece and is constantly misplacing it.	7
I have these Gilmour connectors all around the house, and I love them.  They are practically indestructable, and exceeds my expectations.  I have them hooked up to hoses, bypassing our water softener.  I also use the double connectorsGilmour 13 Brass 2-Way Connectoras well, which are equally as good.  A must have for every home.I recommend using this with a small piece of teflon to prevent corrosion at the connectors.  If corrosion does take place, it can become very difficult to unscrew it.	18
For anyone who likes board games, miniature games or Sci Fi in general or Star Wars in particular, this is a great, fun, simple game that can be a beer 'n' pretzels affair or deeply tactical if you want it to be.The presentation and build of the models and included card stock pieces is first rate. The packaging protective and re-usable and the delivery I received from Amazon was super speedy.The B Wing adds some awesome capabilities to the game and really kicks but in play!	22
These are great! Easy on, easy off... you can walk with confidence in the snow/ ice and they have had a workout this winter! I bought them for all my daughters and parents.  Even my little grandson wanted some, they are a bit too big for him this year but the extra small may fit him next year.  The sizes are deceiving, since I think a size 11 women's is large but it only takes a medium trak to fit the shoe well.  You can even wear them with heals because of the design.	8
Don't be fooled, this is a great album, has a rythm and blues feel to it, the lyrics are cool. You can feel these guys had fun writing this album. Completely disagree with the 1 Star ratings or for that matter anything less than 3 stars, some people have anger issues. The music is great, definitely better than some of the older Sammy albums. It's a bit different, laid back, it's all Sammy Hagar material here, nothing surprising, and in no way are these guys selling on their big names alone... can't wait to see them again in concert.	6
Once again Cathryn Fox has done it. She's combined contemporary sexy, cute and funny to leave me turning pages faster than a race car. I loved how Lindsey was turned off from men, more interested in establishing her career until she meets handyman Brad, who pulls of Alpha male in a quiet, I can do it way. I loved that the characters developed a real connection and it was about more than sex, which was great. This book was fast-paced, the dialogue was real and it left me wanting to try BDSM with a smile on my face. Thanks Fox for another great read.	14
INVITE 2 TO 1000 OF YOUR CLOSEST FRIENDS OVER FOR A HOUSE-PARTY; GET OUT THE CARDS, PLAY SOME TONK, MAYBE SOME SPADES, PUT THIS CD ON FIRST AND PLAY IT, DRINK SOME KOOL-AID, PLAY MORE CARDS, CUSS AND EXXAGERATE STORIES, PLAY A WHOLE BUNCH OF DIFFERENT MUSIC IN-BETWEEN AND THEN, NEAR THE END OF THE PARTY, PUT THIS CD ON AGAIN...MOST OF THE INTERLOPERS SHOULD HAVE LEFT BY NOW AND YOU AND YOUR REAL-REAL BUDDIES CAN DO WHAT'CHU DO. ENJOY.	9
This RPG is a blast to play!  The graphics and battle system will blow you away when you first play it!  There's even a tutorial, so you can get in the game quicker!  As for the storyline, excellent!  The storyline goes all over the place, but that's what fun about it!  The game itself is also long and entertaining.  It took me 73 hours to finish, side-quests and all.  You even get an amusement park filled with games and wonderful items to help you on your quest.  Get this game!!!  It will get you hoooked on hours to come!!!	23
This app wouldn't download my songs to my 16gig SD card reliably, and when it did, it was epic fail. It &lt;&lt;NEVER>> imported all my music even though I checked carefully to ensure I hadn't gone over the level. It may have been something I am doing wrong, but I doubt it. The app asks you where you want the stuff loaded to, then arbitrarily decides where to load the stuff to. Save your time and money. I'm looking for a better solution, and in the meantime, I'm doing this the old-fashioned way. Hey! CDs!	1
Like most of the other reviewers, I'm very happy with mine too.  I just wanted to add that it is almost impossible to screw up with this model. The blade is well positioned and protected enough that, excuse my French, you pretty much can just stick it in your ear or nose, twirl a bit, and presto!  The only exception to this IMHO is cutting nose hairs so short that my nose feels 'raw' for a bit....so just don't...stick...it...in....so....far.  :-)	12
The Good:  I bought this to accompany a new Karcher 2700PSI gas pressure washer.  It works as advertised and cut the time to clean my driveway and patio noticeably.  The construction seems flimsy at first bit in reality it is very well made.  I have used it at least 6 time and every time it performs well.The Bad:  I honestly have not found anything worth complaining about with this model.  The instructions might have been slightly better written, but that is just whining on my part.  I was able to figure it out soon enough that it wasn't a big deal.	18
This is easily E-40's best work. &quot;In a Major Way&quot; is top-notch material from beginning to end. The beats provide classic West Coast g-funk, while 40's flows and linguistics are solid as usual.Nearly every track is equal in calibur, but the 3 stand-outs would probably be the classic &quot;Dusted &amp; Disgusted,&quot; &quot;1-Luv,&quot; and &quot;Spittin.&quot;There's not one weak track on here. If you're into the West Coast sound, and even if you're not, this is an album you should definitely have in your collection.The West could use another album of this calibur these days.	9
I really wanted to buy a kickboxing video that would not be too complicated. As a user of other Kathy Smith videos, I decided to purchased this one. The moves are fairly simple and you can get a good workout. Unlike a lot of Kathy's other videos, there are no modifications for lower or higher intensity, but since it is not a standard floor aerobics video, it really isn't necessary to do so. If you are looking for something different to add to your routine, this is a good choice.	15
It's a nice thick pad and seems comfortable enough to use in place of a sheet everyday, but it's too expensive for a sheet and because it has the rubber bottom, you can't really put it in the dryer without harming it. It takes a long time to hang dry. If it were less expensive, I'd get a few more. So I use it as a water proof pad and put a sheet over the top of it, but that takes away from the ease of putting it on the mattress, since It gets tucked in the fitted sheet.	3
Works as advertised.  Only problem I have had is that sometimes it never goes out of solid red after connecting to the motorcycle, and if I unplug it for a few hours, and then plug it back in, it seems to then go through the correct cycle, ending in green.  This could be the fault of the battery, but I can't know, so I am giving it a 4.5 stars (rounded down from 5 to 4 in this case).  I also wish the cord were a few feet longer and they used multiple LED's to show status.	2
Like a lot of reviewers here, I bought the VHS edition when it first came out...nothing but the highest praise for that version.  There is perhaps no better single video that so superbly documents what these guys do onstage  ( at least not with Dickey Betts in the lineup ).  I was fortunate enought to have stumbled upon the DVD for rent first...which I did, and that was it, for reasons stated so well by everybody else here.  By the way, the VHS tape can be copied to DVD, which I heartily recommend!	6
The smell is fantastic but I wished it was stronger and lasted longer; though maybe this would be good for someone who wants scented body wash but who are sensitive to overpowering scents. My husband even loves the smell. I was happy that there is a good amount of lather since most shampoos that are sulfate free do not have any lather. I even used it as a shampoo and it did not dry my hair out at all! I have since tried the tropical scent of this body wash and I prefer it more over the honey mango.	4
Although I didn't like my CallPod Dragon bluetooth headset, I love this CallPod Charger.  I started running out of places to charge my multiple gadgets at night, each one wanting is own outlet.  With this unit, I charge two cell phones, my bluetooth headset, two Ipods, and I still have room for expansion.  Best of all, I only have to tie up a single outlet.My only complaint is that I would like to be able to turn off all the little LEDs for each connected device.  At night, my bedroom ceiling glows blue due all those LEDs.	7
In my opinion, bore snakes are a must when cleaning.  I don't recommend this to be the only method to cleaning and should be a supplement to the cleaning rod and patches.I typically use the bore snake after the rod and patches to make sure I really purge whatever junk is in the barrel.  Then I would run a light coat of oil afterwards.  That may seem excessive to some but with the possible threat to our gun rights nowdays, we must take good care of the wonderful firearms that we have!	20
This mic stand does everything it says it will, and is adjustable in every conceivable way. In fact, the boom has a really nice adjusting lever, making it easy to loosen and tighten. The only drawback I found is the tripod configuration of its feet, making it easy to forget where you parked your big feet during live performances; especially when you're emotionally invested and the crowd is urging you on. I would much prefer a round base. Other than that, it makes for a great home/garage mic stand when you or your band is just kickin' it. 'Nuff said.	16
I bought this for popcorn after reading all the reviews. To keep it short here, it's way too salty, so you have to use just a little, then you can't taste it because all you can taste is salt. Then there's that super artificial bright orange color which is not at all close to the color of most cheddar cheeses. Too artificial looking. To sum it up, I do not recommend this for anything. Can't imagine putting on pasta for mac & cheese! Way too salty! Ick!I will continue my search for cheese powder.	11
I have completed all 5 books.  I enjoyed reading them a lot.  The stories were interesting.  There was lots of action and drama, some unsavory, some honorable characters, but it's all just too much in my opinion.  It's like getting a history of the U.S. with all details from 1650, when all you REALLY want to know about is the civil war and who won.  I will read books 6 & 7 if they ever come out.  I don't know if I'll ever RE-read them.  (Tolkien I re-read once every couple of years)	5
I am very pleased with my Frontman 25R. I purchased as a practice amp. The sound quality is very clear, and it has all the volume you will ever need. With the gain and drive cranked up to 10, I set the volume at 3. That is all the volume I need for practicing in my home. You could actually use it on an outdoor stage at level 10. I cranked it up to test it, and the sound quality was still clear at 10. I would recommend it as a good economical all around amp.	16
For the price you can't beat this item. I bought and returned a couple of changing table hanging organizers. This one is what I settled on. It fits my badger basket changing table just fine. I was really looking for something small to keep wipes and ointments handy in. I like that I can also for my small prefolds (for cloth diapering) in where the diapers go. They don't fit perfect, but well enough that I'm happy! I paid less than $9 for this item so I really have no complaints. It serves its purpose!	3
Car insurance rates are astronomical in my city, so I gave up my car and rent one when I need to do shopping, errands, appts, etc.Run out of healthy dog treats?  NEVER!!!  I order them from Amazon  -- one of their trusted merchants makes sure my Lulu has what she needs, on time.  OR, I could spend $30 in gas for my rental car going to the burbs to pick up what I gotta have!  Lulu thanks you and I thank you, Amazon.	19
I love sriracha.  I remember getting hooked on it in the Teriyaki houses in Kirkland, WA many years ago.  I hadn't had it for some time but recently purchased a bottle for nostalgia's sake.  I find myself putting it on everything -- scrambled eggs, pizza, spaghetti, Chinese food -- even in my morning grits on days when I need an extra urgency in my stride. :-)  It's very good at imparting heat without that overpowering vinegar taste that other sauces impose.  I can't imagine I'll be without my bottle of Sriracha again anytime soon.	11
I thought this was a more powerful dryer...my bad. I'm going to keep it since I like the color (LOL) and it dries well  with a high and low setting and 2 speeds, and has concentrator and attachment for curls. Both attachments are very tough to take off...I'm so afraid I'll break one of them....they need a better system to get them on and off. The dryer is only 1275 watts, not exactly powerful. And, very important, the buttons for high/low/off/ and heat settings are very small, and placed badly. I keep accidentally turning off the blower!	4
It works fine under Windows ME, 2000, and XP, because you dont need drivers, I read a bad review for this item, and let me tell to the autor: or you have an old windows version(98 or 95) or you need to contact support, but not for this device, you need suport for the CF card developer, because this its just an adapter.Its faster than usb readers(max 12mbps) and of course really more faster than cable connection from the device(1.2mbps), the speed limit its the speed of youre CF card(more than 12x its great).	10
Funny what you don't know will cause a problem when you're a first time RV'er.  My dog's toenail got painfully stuck when she was climbing the steps up into the travel trailer. They're not particularly long but she's a big dog and got one somehow caught in those little holes in the step. I assume those holes are there for drainage or something.  Anyway I bought two of these in blue, put them on lickety split and there's been no problem since...convincing the dog the steps were safe to use again took more time!	2
I think everyone should see this movie at least once. Then never again. There is this cool book, the Bible, tells the whole story without all the blood and tears. I saw this movie with a group of my friends and we were all crying by the end. Even the ones who aren't religious. It is a very powerful movie. But not a movie I would want to see over and over again. Not only because there is not a lot of replay value, but also because of the sheer violence.	15
I found this show to be completely captivating.  We all become psychoanalysts watching this, you can't help but pick apart the psychology of the women involved.  One feels horribly sorry for most of these women, who are so insecure and desperate that they go looking for prisoners to marry, only to be horribly taken advantage of, almost every time.  All the excuses they make for themselves and how they're different... how you can't help who you fall in love with (yeah, right!)... fascinating stuff.  I wish there was a season two.	0
This Actron CP9125 is an invaluable tool in that it allows you to clear the CEL (check engine light) without having to disconnect the battery and risk possibly causing another problem.  If, for example, your gas cap is left loose and the CEL comes on, you can immediately reset the CEL rather than panic and go to the stealership.  But most people don't realize the OBD-II (on-board diagnostics) will actually self reset after a number of cycles, but few people understand the testing cycle process.	2
Nick Drake's second album, Bryter Layter, is the &quot;lightest&quot; sounding of the three he released during his lifetime.  While not happy by any means, there is a breezy sound that flows throughout the album that adds a lighter touch to such brooding tracks as &quot;Fly&quot;, &quot;Poor Boy&quot; and the two &quot;Hazy Jane&quot; songs.  The standout track on the album is the incredible &quot;At The Chime Of A City Clock&quot; which digs at the depths of the man and he confessionally lays his thoughts on the table.  Another striking album from the troubled yet talented singer.	9
These clamps are the little cousin of Pony's great 3/4&quot; pipe clamps.  While the 1/2&quot; clamps work fine within their limits, they do have  limits.  Applying a lot of pressure will flex a 1/2&quot; pipe, possibly  leading to an out of square joint.  I also do not think that the clamp  tightening mechanism is as well made as on the 3/4&quot; clamps, but it is  still pretty good.  I have several of these clamps and while I think they  are a good value for the money, I would suggest spending a few more dollars  for the 3/4&quot; clamps.	21
I used these until we could get our 1 year Norwich Terrier into &#34;cataract surgery, he had juvenile cataracts. If you are a dog owner please take some time to teach your dog to wear these excellent eye protective glasses!!  If your dog rides in a car with his head outside the window or in any situation where debris can hit him in the eye these are excellent to be worn. It will not take much to train your dog to keep the on their face and you will protect the precious gift of &#34;eyesight&#34; for your pet.	19
While Stevie's Albums at Best since this One have been Up&amp;Down this one was Very Complete.The Music&amp;Lyrics are Solid From Start To Finish.All I Do With Michael Jackson is a Gem.Rocket Love is Great.Betty  Wright,The O'Jays,The Gap Band all Sound Great.Happy Birthday is a Great  Tribute To Dr.Martin Luther King JR.Jodeci did a Remake of Lately a few  years back.Master Blaster(Jammin) a Great Tribute To Bob Marley.Fantastic  from The Genius Mind Of Stevie Wonder.	9
Although I will never watch it again, I was glad that I went to see this powerful movie.  It accurately portrays Jesus' last tortured hours on planet earth.  I give kudos to Gibson, who was brave enough to finance this movie himself, amidst much controversy.  I would encourage all to watch this movie, at least one time, to understand why throughout the ages, thousands have been willing to die for their belief in a man called Jesus Christ.Yes, this movie is violent, but this world is violent, and Jesus did not come to escape the realities of this world, but to share in our sufferings.	15
I've played a few labyrinth type games and this one of the better ones.  The 3D is a little misleading because 3D cell phones are coming out and this does not take advantage of that feature.  It is only 3D in that it moves around several dimensions and isn't flat.The game is pretty responsive and I didn't notice any lag.  The challenges are some of the better ones I've seen.  This was actually a lot more fun than other Labyrinth games I've played and it kept my interest far longer.	1
I am a huge fps fan, but i don't get why everyone likes this game so much.  I found it rather boring and dull.  The gameplay was slow, most of the game was just going around looking for buttons to push to activate different things, which got old in about the first 20 minutes of gameplay.  i admit this game is very good, but i just cant see why it has gotten so much hype.  if u want to get the coolest fps then get Clive Barker's Undying	23
Don't be fooled by the silly premise of this game. This is arguably one of the best turn-based strategy games around. With loads of options and weapons and randomly generated maps, this game has near-infinite replay  value. The multiplayer is perhaps the best part. It is always more fun to  play live opponents in this type of game. An added bonus is that this game  will play well even on low end systems. If you are a fan of this type of  game, and have not played it, you just cannot go wrong with Worms  Armageddon.	23
Okay. This game ... If you think this game is good, play Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 2 and see what you think after that. This game lacks good graphics and doesn't have enough tricks to keep you awake. I mean, come on! One lip trick?! Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 2 has plenty of lip tricks, grab tricks, flip tricks, and specials. Plus, on Pro Skater 2 you have the ability to decide what tricks are performed for which button. If you are a true Tony Hawk fan, don't get this game. It will upset you to much.	23
When I first read the title and the back of this book,  I wasn't the least bit interested.  However --- two of my sisters, my daughter,  and my niece were reading the book at the same time --- and all four of them loved it and recommended it highly.  I had to get it --- and I had to agree with them!  Its a great story!  One that is amost impossible to put down!  I highly recommend this read!  I just hope the movie doesn't ruin it.	5
I find this brush to be far more comfortable to use than the standard Oral-B brush head -- no gum irritation at all, but it still gets my teeth feeling clean.  I alternate between this brush and the Floss-Action head (the one with the plastic paddles in addition to the bristles). The Floss Action works better at getting in between teeth, but can be a bit hard on the gum line (but not as bad as the standard brush head). Using and alternating between both the soft and the Floss Action works very well for me.	12
I used this to clean an expensive set of whitewall tires before selling a classic car at auction and it was a big mistake! I bought this because I wanted to use something safe to clean the whitewalls. It did OK on the white area, as in it didn't ruin it. The black part of the tires ended up discolored with streaks. It looked horrible! The tires looked better before I used it!409 and Simple Green do a better of cleaning than this product.I will never trust this brand for any product.	2
These snap on gutter extensions are a must for RV's that don't have them. They just snap on to the existing small gutter extensions supplied by the RV manufacturers.  Keeps those black streaks from forming on the side of your RV. I don't understand a reviewer who stated he's never seen them in 40 years of camping. We had them on our 2007 Jayco Eagle and now on our 2014 Cougar HC 321RES trailer. They are cheap- they work & they just snap on or off.Takes a lickin & keeps ticken.....	2
flash jumps around a bib in this adventure, but in the west his manner improved form deplorable to tolerably despicable.I don't think it would be amused with the O&H; show tune , I want to be an Indian too , wouldn't you?  Like a Sioux! .But he honest shows a slice of what the encroaching society effect were on the fictional charterers and there action and reaction to the new world . As far as the locals, heck it was their street corner so I won't make any judgment.	5
I've played this pedal for a while now and really dig it. I'm old school, Fender Blues Deluxe reissue and Strats and Teles, this pedal has a great, warm, organic feeling tremolo that I use a lot. You can barely bring it in for some warmth, or really crank the speed and depth for a great sort of rotary speaker effect.I'll use it with the rate set at tempo for a song and record clean guitar chords up on the middle of the neck. This effect will give you a nice almost Hammond B-3 type of organ sound.	16
I had always just used a regular lamp and a south facing window. And only had limited and some what pathetic results despite years of trying. I finally decided to stop messing around. Put this on my Amazon Wish List for Christmas and was happy to get it. Combined with a seedling heat mat under my seedlings I am seeing faster and healthier growth in all of the seeds I planted. Many of those only sprout in full sun, and I do not think any of them would have come up without this lamp. Very excited, and have just ordered another one!	18
As many folks out there, including Anthony Bourdain I too was scared of pressure cookers. After I purchased this my first one I made sure to study the entire manual, as if for a school test. The rocker type is really totally harmless! Cooking times are slashed by at least two thirds, less gas and therefor less escaped heat and better inefficiency make this cooking method a winner. Cleanup is also very quick. The heavy base and material compound allows for some nice browning of meat, which is essential for good flavor. Anne Burrell always says:&#34;Brown Food tastes Good&#34;.	13
With this purchase, I have now purchased all 15 seasons of this wonderful series.  I'm not in the medical field, but this drama gave me a greater appreciation of it.  NBC did a wonderful job.  The actors and actresses in this 15 year series were some of the best.  Thank you also to Amazon for providing me with some of the DVD's.  I hope that those of you who read this review are as big a fan as I am of this show, and that your collection is complete as well.	0
I suffer from a weakness in my hands, which makes gripping and holding most bowls steady very difficult for me - usually I have to use both hands, which makes mixing ingredients a real problem.  This product is perfect for me.  The rubber bottom holds the bowl nicely in place for me (so I can hold it steady with one hand and mix with the other) and it's wonderfully large so that even if I do tip it a little, the contents do not spill all over the place.	13
We really like this game for family game night.  My daughter asks to play it over and over.  I also own Dixit: Journey and have folded the two games together, but mostly I like the cards and the components to this game better.  This is a great game for kids that allows them to expand their imagination, and also fun for adults to come up with creative ways to describe cards that kids will understand.  Really fun, and I saw this on Wil Wheaton's Tabletop show and knew we would love it.  Great addition to family game night.	22
OK. So it was left in dirt by SEGA. Who cares? It still has the sweetest games and awesome controler(though I must say it is very ugly). The VMU(visual memery unit) is the best memery card for any system. My favorite games are 1. All the 2Ks, 2K1s, and 2K2s 2. Sonic Adventure(1-2) 3. Crazy Taxi (1-2) and 4. Soul Calibur. Sure, I'll buy a PS2, X-BOX, and NGC, but Dreamcast is going to keep me busy for A WHILE.	23
These are a smooth writing, well made, comfortable pencil.  I wanted something made in the USA, but our neighbors to the south in Mexico did a great job making these.  They sharpen well, and stay sharp, we don't have a problem with the lead breaking constantly like the pencils made in China.  The erasers have lasted quite well, but I do recommendStaedtler Mars Plastic Erasers,Pack of 4 (52650BK4), they are a great addition to any office supplies.  I really enjoy the round barrel over the standard hexagonal, much more comfortable and easy to write with.  I would recommend these pencils!	17
What can I say, they are Ernie Ball Slinky strings. I've been using Slinkys on my acoustics and electrics for 40 years and they have never let me down- (Unlike some of the higher priced strings) I might add. Very responsive and never dull or weak sounding. Crisp highs and smooth lows that don't get &#34;mudded&#34; out. I would recommend these to anyone to at least try a set on your acoustic guitar and Ernie Ball Super Slinkys on your electric guitar. Still, after all of these years and innovations in strings, Ernie Ball still gets my vote hands down!!	16
"Okay, my third try, here's the censored version:  This was a terrible idea.  I didn't realize what i was buying so i guess i'm an idiot for wasting my money.  Placing Type O Negative over the soundtrack to a 1930's black and white silent film is like trying to watch ""Dawn of the Dead"" overdubbed with ""The Monster Mash"".  Utterly awful. These bogus made-up ""Goths"" have spoiled the vampire mystique for everyone. Even if i liked this sorry-ass band (which i don't),i'd still think this was a horrible, LAME idea."	6
RU Still Down first posthumus 2pac album is my favorite one created after he died. Pacs vocals are not sped up and the production sounds like a 2pac album. I could list this whole album as the best songs but the standouts to me are RU Still Down, Hellrazor, Wonder If Heaven Got A Ghetto hip hop version, Open Fire, When I Get Free 1 and 2, Do For Love, F=== All Yall, well just forget it. Every song on here is a standout in my eyes. Pac's albums would go downhill from here.	9
Motorola P513 Car ChargerThe P513 is a micro-USB car charger that works on the Droid, Droid2, and DroidX. I can't figure out a way to change the inline fuse (if there is one), but it is cheap enough to be used as a disposable car charger. The blue LED-lit Motorola logo is a nice touch, as well as the wire tether that is included.Pros: Gets the job done at a great price, looks greatCons: Doesn't appear to be an easy way to change the fuse (if any) - but it is not a big dealOverall: 5/5 stars	7
This album absolutely kicks the snot out of 95%+ of the music to come since. Picking highlights for this album is difficult but here's a couple:Ghetto Cartoon: Coolio gives you a rather twisted urban fairy tale featuring all the WB and Disney characters, hilarious and deft.Gangsta's Paradise: The title track to a major movie, and one of they very few rap songs that goes for 'haunting' and achieves it.Mama, I'm In Love Wit A Gangsta: Told half in telephone conversation and all in style.Just buy the album already.	9
Over the years, I've sampled probably 50 varieties of energy bars, and the Balance cookie dough flavor top the list. The provide the variety of nutrition I want in terms of the combination of protient, fiber, fats, and vitamins. Best of all they don't have lingering artificial taste I get from most other energy bars. Moreover, these don't require gnawing to chew and swallow. The only aspect I would improve upon would be the sugar content, which though not bad by energy bar standards, could probably be a few grams lower without sacrificing taste.	12
I absolutely love this jigsaw, so much that I actually try to come up with projects requiring its use. Plenty of power, rock solid cutting, easy-enough blade changes, and with the Progressor blades, amazing cutting speed with great smoothness. I was, like many people moving up to this kind of tool, replacing a older Ryobi-Craftsman -- one that I thought was pretty decent -- but there's just no comparison. The Craftsman got sold at a yard sale for $4. The newer Bosch 1590 model has gotten some wishy-washy reviews, so I went with the proven performer and I don't regret it a bit.	21
A mix of both slow and mid-tempo (though mostly slow) songs of faith, love, and desire.&quot;Homie, Lover, Friend&quot; expresses every person's desire to have someone that they can have fun with as a &quot;homie,&quot; make love to as a &quot;lover,&quot; and trust as a &quot;friend.&quot;Classic songs include &quot;Bump N Grind&quot;, &quot;Sex Me&quot;, and &quot;your Body's Callin'.&quot;Listen to this on the beach while you're relaxing or when you turn out the lights with that special someone.	9
Love it............... it cleans skin wounderful, if u boil hot water on the stove.steam it, take a hot washcloth and let it soak for about 1 min, cool the cloth down it a lilcold water.. put the cloth on your face let it sit there for about 1 min to open your pores.take a lil bit of facial cleanser and rub it on your face, then rinse of with cold water... skin comes outlooking like milk.. wait about 2 mins then put your favorite moisturizer on your skin, head out the door.and start your day.. trus me.	4
"Just got this last night, and I have to say it's stunning.  I purchased Woodstock as an excuse to purchase a blu-ray player, and I'm happy I did.  The colors pop, you see detail you never saw in the original DVD.And yes, some of the songs have been ""repaired"" with added instrumentation, which I have NO PROBLEM WITH.  I suppose it would be immoral if they didn't tell us they did it.  But they told us.  They even made a video to show the process, which is pretty amazing.So quit complaining and turn it up!And oh yeah, groovy.Kaz"	6
The brush for this eyeliner is horrible. I LOVE brushes, and prefer them over felt tips but this is the exception. The brush for this eyeliner is VERY small and too soft. It's hard to make a straight line because the bristles are just all over the place. Additionally, when you go over to reapply liner in some places - when it dries, it tends to look very clumpy and unflattering. I had such high hopes for this liner because of the brush applicator and how beautifully matte the color was but this is a total fail.	4
The tone of the story was fun.  I enjoyed the narration in the first paragraph or so.  And then the narration disappeared and it started to feel more like a screenplay.  It was mostly reading quotes and trying to remember who was talking in what order (and when a conversation involved more than two people I sometimes got lost).  There was very little description of either the surroundings or the characters, something I would have liked to help get lost in the story.  It was a quick read, though.	14
THE OXFORD MURDERS is typical British cinema--cerebral, pondering and tedious.  While BBC's WAKING THE DEAD is excellent, this movie doesn't compare on any level.An interesting mystery is shrouded with mathematical mumbo jumbo which rises above the average viewer's knowledge or interest (like TV's NUMB3RS).LOTR's Elijah Wood uses his soulful eyes and little else in his wooden performance; John Hurt is excellent as always, and Julie Cox chews up the scenery.The movie's twist ending is surprising but gets anti-climactic execution.Primarily, it's just all rather boring.	0
This is the first time I ever saw these three guys playing guitar. Satriani, Johnson and Vai. Each of them play 3 songs, and at the end they all unite and play together 3 more songs. This DVD is killer. The quality of the sound is just so good that you think you're listening to the CD. I sometimes turn on my surround sound and play this DVD and makes me think WOW! This is a must for any serious fan, or for anyone who loves guitar music. If I could give it a 10 stars, I'd give 10.	6
I won't belabor the readers with a blow by blow of the plot; it is ably covered by other reviews.  Know this--that this is a great book, rated a 6 on a scale of 1 to 5 and far superior to the ordinary fare out there today.  If you are middle-aged or older, this will bring back memories of the old circuses and carnie-shows; if you are younger, this is a history lesson.  Regardless of age, you will thoroughly enjoy this book.	5
This game, at first seems interesting but quickly you realize that its too short and has no replay value. once you solve the game there is nothing else to do, so max 20 minutes of playing. don't waste your money. spend that dollar somewhere else. got it for free and even that sounds like too much for this game, waste of space on my phone. if any new levels are created they're probably going to charge for them. DO NOT BUY THIS GAME, YOU WILL REGRET IT. sounds more fun than it really is.	1
I love Kava tea by Yogi. I used to purchase this in the local health food store, but they stopped carrying it after negative publicity of possible liver problems from Kava. I was pleased to find it on Amazon. Free shipping and the discount for &#34;subscribing&#34; makes it a deal too good to pass up.As far as the product itself, I love the taste of this Kava tea. I have a cup in the evening, and it is really soothing and relaxing. I could not imagine winding down in the evening without this tea.	11
I now make naan, flour tortillas, and gyro bread.  I LOVE being able to so easily cut the dough into portions (12, 16, 12).  What I like, too, is using the scraper to pat the tortilla dough into a more uniform shape before I cut it so the portions are equal.  The key to fluffy flour tortillas is to work the dough as little as possible.  At least it is on the recipe I use (flour, olive oil, milk, salt, and baking powder).  So, this awesome cutter does double duty for me!!	13
These pink erasers have stood the test of time.  We have bought some crummy pencils with useless erasers and have needed and used these every year.  Yes, we ONCE made the mistake of buying an off brand--do not compromise.  Just don't bother.  Others will smudge or break apart or tear your paper.  The size of these is great too--many traced or pencil drawn projects need to be gently erased before they're turned in, and these make quick work of erasing even large posterboard projects.  Two pink thumbs up!	17
I just tried this today. It is not bad. It tasted a lot better once I started to get used to it. At first it tasted like the inside of a toosie pop than kind of like fudge. I just thought it would be more of a balance between the coco and nut. But all I can taste is the coco. It's just a little too sweet for plain bread. I'm going to mix it with some peanut butter for my sandwiches. I think it would be great on top of a brownie.	11
I see I'm not the first review to find this show similar to Ocean's 11.  It has a lot of the same pleasures: attractive, quirky protagonists, great, elaborate scams (some of which are revealed and some concealed from the viewer until the end), and a great deal of humor.  Much of the humor comes from the characters' interactions: this is a team of folks who are used to working alone. While some shows are more inventive and compelling than others, they are pretty uniformly engaging.  Leverage is an easy addiction: a dependable good time.	0
We just adopted our two year old cat and have been testing out different wet and dry foods. I got Wellness Salmon and Wellness Beef and Chicken and the Beef and Chicken was the winner. We judged this based on the following: Cole ate the Beef and Chicken in about 20 seconds and licked the bowl clean. Hasn't happened with any other food! We also recommend the Wellness dry food. This cat food is expensive though compared to others but if I don't eat crappy processed food why expect my cat to?	19
i knew it would be small but i wasn't thinking this small, ,it shore is cute,, good enough for now ,but not for the long-run,, shore its loud for the size but, it rattles when you turn it up and amps slides  from vibration,,if you keep it on lower sound its fine, this is only for temporary use for me. its an ok tiny mini little amp  (for it's size its good,) don't exspect a fender amp thats all,	16
I have used this product (lip balm)for a long time, and I am extremely satisfied with it, because it has SPF15 and menthol. That is why I ordered this product again.The shipment arrived sooner than expected and the product is undamaged. I was keeping my fingers crossed because the climatic condition for the past few days has been extremely hot. Said and done, the lip balm did not melt.I, highly recommend, NATURAL ICE MENTHOLATED SPF15 Lip Balm for every one for daily use.Thank you, people at NATURAL ICE and thank you, AMAZON.SincerelyKJ Kumar	12
As a musical family, my husband and I enjoy this video as much as my daughter does!  Members of Stomp and other Sesame Street clips show us that music is all around us--we can make music with anything!  All the rhythmic clapping, tapping, banging on pots (always a fun toddler activity), and singing really keep my 17 month old daughter enthralled.  We're thrilled, because my husband and I really hope she develops the love of music we have. Even if you're not pushing music at home, it's very entertaining for the young ones, and a good video to add to your Sesame Street library!	15
We built a home that is near a protected wildlife area and had a real problem (yard is unfenced) with deer, rabbits, and not sure what other wildlife, munching down our landscaping pretty much constantly. Fencing would ruin the natural setting we enjoy, but we were definitely losing the landscape wars before we found this repellant spray. After the first application we noticed a lot less damage, and now that we got real thorough with the coverage of the spray, we have NO nibbles at all - plus it keeps the wildlife deposits (dung) away from the house. Recommended!	18
This book was enchanting.  Immediately you become under it's spell from the first words. The mystery, history, action, and love stories of the circus all wrapped up in one.The story is about Jacob Jankowski, the circus vet.  Under tragic circumstances, he joins a second rated circus and becomes entangled into all their lives, whether he wants to or not.  Bouncing between his current status, which is in a nursing home at the age of 93 or 99 (he's not sure) and his circus life, there is a mystery deep in the heart of it.	5
My deadlift had gotten to the point that &#34;grip it and rip it&#34; was no longer cutting it, thanks to my grip slipping/rolling out.This chalk was a VERY good way to help with that problem. One block broken up makes a surprising amount of chalk and should last a long time.The only con I've noticed with it is that it dries out your hands like you wouldn't believe. (Which IS kind of the point.) Have some lotion or something handy for after workouts and you'll be fine, though.	20
I have used El Yucateco Habanero (red) sauce for years, and I love it. Mainly becauseits hot as Hell, and the company makes no apologies for that.This stuff has a mild smokey flavor, without the bite that its big brother has. You canjust pour this directly on chips, in salsa, soups, etc. Its very very good, and muchbetter than Tabasco Chipotle or any other widely available sauce.$2.99 is a great price. Thats what I pay for it locally, but I had to search it out.	11
Short romance... three becomes twoJake & Dana's story.  Great characters and story.  Much more depth than the usual romance.  Excellent emotional element.  This is one of my favorites by this author!My only complaint was the ebook was full of errors... grammatical, omission errors, misspelled, and more.  This seems to happen a lot in ebooks and it never ceases to annoy me.  Just because it's not on paper it doesn't mean the product should have shoddy workmanship.  Please get proofreaders worthy of your works!!!Keep in mind that this is an erotic romantic read.  4* of 5*	14
"Do you mind if I give you some of my........12 play?What else can I say about the king? This album is a true RnB classic. I listen to this album and I hear the passion in his voice, the seduction in the production and........the bad rapping! But when its the 'R' you can forgive him for a few blunders (i.e. ""I like the crotch on you"" and ""Back to the hood of things"" ugh!) Nevertheless, this album is pure brilliance. Love him or like him he just may be the greatest RnB artist of all time!"	9
I cannot recommend this product enough.  There are so many things to say...it improves your sex life tremendously!  It helps incontinence!  And if you have organ prolapse and are scared that surgery is your only choice...THIS DVD IS FOR YOU!  I suffered for many months with a prolapse and was terrified of having surgery (have you seen all the commercials for attorneys suing for that very surgery?!).  With regular use I've been able to stave off the prolapse!  And my sex life has been so greatly improved because I'm not longer uncomfortable or in pain!  Don't hesitate!  HabIt is worth every penny!!	15
I bought this on a whim since I was one day late and my body is like clockwork. Imagine my shock when I took two test and one came out positive and the other negative. I was hyperventilating. We were safe but things happen - condoms are not 100% and I was off my pill due to how ill it made me. I made a doc's appointment for blood work and we found out I was never pregnant.... Happy ending - yes. But we are still traumatized, if this was an accurate test a lot of stress could have been avoided.	12
I create presentation boards for design presentations and I often find myself needing to affix a piece of marble, tile or carpet to the board. Glue doesn't hold and regular tape is a joke. Scotch mounting tape, however, does the job. Normally if I affix a piece of marble it has fallen off of the board by the end of the day - I have marble still sticking to the board weeks later and no signs of letting go. This tape is amazing and, though I can't say for sure, it truly seems to be a permanent tape. Highly recommended.	17
Hands down the greatest fighting game ever made.  Almost a decade after its release it still tops of even the newest fighters out there.  Dreamcast had the most potentioal over all the other systems, to bad Sega Sold out.  Every character, level, skill, story goes above and beyond.  Top's the most recent Soul Calibur 4 that was released this past July.  This game should be ported exactly the way it is to Next-Generation systems with a graphic enchancement.To bad many have not been able to witness the first Soul Calibur because it was on the Dreamcast.It needs to get recognized by the Nex-Generation gamers.	23
Great product, but make sure you read the directions.  You need to keep this away from eyes.  This is a serious skin cleaner, the type that is often given to patients for pre-op preperation. The &#34;anti-bacterial&#34; ingredients in most soaps wash away.  This product's active ingredients keep working after you have rinsed.  Some folks swear on its usefulness for Acne or persistant odor problems.  I used it when I had a minor skin infection in a place that was hard to bandage all day.  It works, but again, read the directions.	12
These are nice, sturdy plastic dividers that you can see through.  I like to put a cover page behind each tab so I can see info about each section.8 tabs per set, 5 sets per box, for a total of 40 divider tabs.Wilson Jones' product support is great too - they have nice templates to use with the dividers, and provide both portrait and landscape templates.  Each template can be customized and changed according to what you want to do with it.  Fun and easy to use.	17
I had fond memories of playing this game growing up, so I was excited when my kids received it for Christmas.  After opening the game, however, I'm not so excited.  They have changed the board from the classic version; it is much more visually cluttered and Princess Lollypop and Queen Frostine look like Bratz dolls, which I'm not happy about..  Also, after playing the game as an adult, I realized that it requires no skill whatsoever and is completely a game of chance.  Not super educational.  I'll probably end up donating it to the thrift store.	22
this headphones are very comfortable, i would recomend to anyone that need a non-expensive headphones, i only use them with my PC, the only thing i didn't like was the bass i almost can hear itEstos audifonos son muy c&oacute;modos, tienen un buen volumen y buen aislamento de sonido, lo recomiendo a cualquiera que necesite unos audifonos no tan caros, yo solo los utilizo para mi computadora, me parece que son muy grandes para cargarlos siempre encima pero de todas formas ese era el uso que le queria dar, lo &uacute;nico malo es que le falta m&aacute;s bajo	10
I have seen Water for Elephants  at all the popular bookstores for the last year.  It never appealed to me, so I always passed over it.  This month, it was choosen as my book club's choice and I was pleasently suprised.  It was a true page turner and I finished the book in one weekend.  Gruen captured the time period and the secret world of circus people during the Depression beautifully.  It made me want more and to know more about the people of that era who worked on the circus trains.You won't be disappointed.	5
"We have been using this seat for about 6 months with our toddler boy.  I love how it attaches to the seat easily and securely.  Once it's on, it doesn't budge, but it removes easily.  However, if our son sits down to pee, he gets pee all over the place.  Even with him holding his private part down with his finger.  The cheap ""bob the builder"" toilet seat does a better job of keeping the pee in the toilet while he is sitting.  I wish they would make the seat more compatible with boys."	3
"Scotch is the brand I usually buy when looking for tapes.  I have bought the two sided tapes for years now, for both business and personal needs.  The early lesson I learned was to make doubly sure that you mount to a surface where you won't want to remove the item from later.  If you mount a picture to a painted wall, for example, and then remove it the paint will most likely comme off with the tape.  This tape here is clearly called ""Permanent"" for good reason."	17
Midland make a nice portable unit and it has some nice features for its price. this unit comes with 2 battery packs. one is for standard cells and one is for rechargeable cells. it also has a 12v adapter that takes place of the battery adapter and gives you the option to connect a larger antenna which is great if its taken form vehicle to walking. It's built well and it works flawlessly. if your looking for a good combo unit as a backup or as a main unti this is a great little system.	10
"These are a good product and wear well.  I wear them on my property doing a number of chores including tending our goat herd.  They are comfortable and provide plenty of pockets.  The only criticism was that I ordered a 30"" inseam and received a 36"" inseam.  Not a deal breaker, I just cut 5"" off.  Also, the ones I received were not a light blue, they were dark blue.  Not a problem for me, but could be for someone wanting a light blue pair."	8
We had a gas grill for years but opted to go back to a charcoal grill.  This Weber grill made our decision easy.  Outstanding medium size grill for the two of us grilling several items and works well for 4 or more depending on what you need to prepare on the grill.  Suggest using the Weber Rapidfire Chiminey for starting your briquets...it's great and makes your job not only easier but the food taste better without the use of starter fluid.  Great grill....great name behind it!!	18
I ordered this to help make a better fit for the bike rack on the front of a Ford Expedition. I was specifically hunting for a fairly short extension because I wanted the bikes to stick out no further than necessary. The selection of holes in this extension allowed me to adjust the fit into the receiver, as well as the fit of the bike rack into the extension. This allowed me to fit the bikes about 2 inches closer to the vehicle than any other extension I was able to find. Very pleased with its performance.	2
I really think if your skin is like leather this is for you.  Otherwise, stay away.  I followed the directions and then started cutting back when I noticed it was turning into red splotches.  I finally quit after a week or so.  I was so embarrassed to go out of the house.  All I wanted was to get rid of the red spots that were left after pimples came and left.  I am a strawberry blonde with fair skin.  The alpha hydroxy is the culprit.  I had high hopes.  This product deserves zero stars.	4
I ordered this for use while visiting my parents. It is okay for something like that, but I would not use it for much else.I have a very active 2 year old who does not always want to take time to sit on the potty. She can easily scoot accross the floor while seated on it.It might be good if you have a very early potty trainer or one on the (very) smaller side. My daughter is about 35 inches tall and her knees come to her chest while seated on this.	3
I was looking for a good zombie read. This is not it. The story started out great. But as soon as the story went into the zombies still having thoughts and knowing what they we're doing? I couldn't control my eye rolling. Do these authors understand the meaning of zombie? I couldn't enjoy this story at all. It's actually one of the worst zombie books I have read. Not to mention the editing. This is a revised version? I would have hated to see the before copy.	14
This saw has alot of power.  It is heavily constructed and comes with a dust chute that can be pointed in any direction (see picture, it swivels around).  Well balanced and the ergonomics are good.  If you use a circular  saw on a daily basis, this saw is right for you.  If you are a hobbyist  that uses a circular saw not so often, buy something less expensive and  save the money for another tool.PROS** Power.** Blade cut is  clearly visible.** Easy blade change.** Good depth adjustment  system.CONS** Poorly designed case.** Moderately expensive.	21
I loved this film of Prince Igor!  The singing was superb, authentically Russian, and enthusiastic.  It was especially exciting to see the original choreography of Michel Fokine.  This Soviet opera film is highly entertaining, the dancing is excellent, and the actors seem to be having a great time.  So enjoy, and don't take it all too seriously.  After all, it's Prince Igor, not Die Gotterdammerung or some other monumental work.  Borodin's life long project turned into an enjoyable film.	6
When i bought this, i didn't think it was going to be as good as it is. It seemed a little plastic-ie from the photos, so i didn't think it was going to hold up very well. It actually really surpassed my expectations however. The winder itself works quite well, and has slots for multiple-sized tuners. It was a little wobbley on my guitar, but still worked well. The wire cutter was able to cut the thickest guitar string with little problem. For 7 dollars, it's a really good deal!	16
I decided to buy Bayer Advantage because Frontline Plus was not killing fleas for a whole month, after 2 weeks I noticed fleas on my animals. So when the month was up, I bought Bayer Advantage it works great, for a whole month, killing all fleas, I did have to reapply 2 weeks later because it said so on the box in case of severe infestations to do so. I did so because my animals are allergic to flea bites. I will buy this again. Its a great value here on amazon. Much better than Frontline.	19
This does not only protect, but cleans stains, road film etc. off the paint and bring its to nice clean shine. My cars have ranged from light colours (white and silver) to darker colours (red and blue) and this works perfectly to clean and protect. Sometimes, depending on how dirty the paint was,  2 applications would be done to restore the finish. Safe on clear coats and glass this is perfect. Also, one heavy shower does not remove the wax. Give it a try.	2
I purchased these for my kids and for handing out to my son's scout troop.  The intention is that these be used as safety devices so that if they are lost or in trouble they can blow the whistles instead of yelling.The whistles are black with a ring that can be hung on a backpack, or which can be strung on a cord.  They are loud enough to hear from a pretty good distance, without breaking eardrums.Definitely recommend.  The price I bought them at made the whistles about 70 cents each.	20
Red Mars is a very detailed, sprawling look at realistic Mars colonization. I did not find it to be a quick read. There were areas of this novel that really picked up the pace, while other areas dragged some due to the expert detail. Although it's uneven, it's still a fine book and recommended. In the end, the big story is Tolkien-esque, but with a SF skin.Still, reading this today, I didn't feel that this came out in 1993. Robinson has quite the talent for creating a realistic future.	5
I love the game Mancala but can't find good apps for the game.  This one would be great if there were template options and it would stop freezing.  I play as a single player and if the game wants the computer to go first it freezes.  I have to close the game out and restart it several times so that the player goes first, when the player goes first the game doesn't freeze.03/05/13A recent app update by developer has RESOLVED the freezing issue, so I have changed my rating from 3 to 4 stars.	1
The tape quality is the main reason I'm not giving this a five-star review. The dubbing is absolutely horrendous, and the tape's really bad (why not letterbox? And what's with the grainy picture?) Not TriStar's best  efforts. And a final gripe: why change the title? It's &quot;Godzilla vs.  Mothra,&quot; not &quot;Godzilla and Mothra: the Battle For  Earth.&quot;Lousy tape quality aside, this is an okay movie. The plot is  slow at times, but the FX are surprisingly good, especially the laser light  shows. The monsters look cool, especially Battra. Fans of the giant monster  movie genre will get a kick out of this one.	15
I've been using Mequiar's Quik Detailer for years and it is still the best product I've found.  I've tried other brands including new ones to the market place, and this is still the leader.  One thing I really like about it is if I miss a spot, a quick spray and the surface is consistent in shine and appearance.  Some of the other sprays would be totally dependent on how much product you used, so I would have to go back and keep blending until the difference wasn't noticeable.	2
We have a Conure and he loves to chew stuff.  The first day I put a new Comfy perch in his cage, he christened it by chewing some of it up.  I was a bit disappointed BUT, he stopped and it is still surviving in the cage.  I like these a lot better than wood perches so I keep one in both of his cages and he uses them to perch/sleep on.  ;)  He spends play time on the other perches of different sizes and materials (ie: wood, plastic, manzanita branches, etc).  Helps exercise the feet to have variety.	19
This is like twister in a way -- the mat has the letters (in alphabetical order) around the outside, and the object is for the child to put different body parts on the right letters (selected from the &#34;tornado&#34; spinner).  There are 5 letters or free spaces each time -- feet, hands, and ear.  It doesn't specify which hand, which is good.  The kids will be twisted up trying to get their ear on the &#34;m&#34; and hands on the &#34;a&#34; and &#34;b&#34;!  Mat is a thick, sturdy plastic, adults and children have played on it with no issues.	22
"I was a little disappointed in this product.  I bought it for my husband who has diabetes but who loves dark chocolate.  It tasted bland to both of us.  For the price I was expecting a bit of a ""gourmet"" taste, a chocolate with a smooth, creamy melt.  This chocolate tasted a bit gritty and was neither smooth nor creamy.What I did like was that the vendor enclosed a chemical pack with the shipment that kept the chocolate cool enough despite the summer heat.  This chemical pack prevented the chocolate from arriving in a brown, mushy package."	11
This product does not work with my base unit at all, even though they are both the same brand.  Sales rep was very courteous and stated that it was a defective unit. However, is RCA quality control bad enough to where they get units that absolutely don't work? Very inconvenient for customers. It also seems to me that they have a huge compatability issue w/ base units and extensions from the Amazon reviews I've read. Do your homework and I would advise that anyone looking for a wireless phone jack save up a little more money and buy a better brand.	10
"My two favorite shows of the past ten years have been ""The Sopranos"" and ""The Shield.""  As ""The Sopranos"" limps into its final season--let's face it, that show hasn't had the same compelling intensity since its first three incredible seasons--""The Shield"" is still kicking major butt.The quality has never let up and I would highly recommend that you watch every season from the very beginning.  The writing is so inventive and the acting is just dynamite.I can't wait to see where they're going with this!"	0
I'll skip all the fancy jargon, and just say that this CD has FAR exceeded my expectations for the album. I've had every album Skillet has ever made, and overall this is my favorite. Glad they've brought a bit of keyboards back in on this one, and they let Ben run wild on guitar! Kid is talented. It's also got great lyrics that can appeal to the MTV crowd and still be uplifting and point to God. Do yourself a favor and buy the cd ASAP. This is the CD I'll be listening to for a month or so straight.	6
Have had this for a few weeks now and love it. The kit will test for PH levels in two ranges (high/low), Ammonia, Nitrite, and Nitrate. I have been using this kit for my aquaponics system and it has all the needed tests to ensure the right levels for plants and fish. This would also work great for an aquarium as well since they have similar needs. Instruction are clear and easy to follow and kit comes with enough solution to test probably 75 times. Check out my full review of the product here - http://youtu.be/SFRlC8q_AOw	19
I love this app.  I use it on my home computer all the time.  Every real estate agent says NO NO NO  don't use this let me get your info, but in my experience this gives me comps, five years worth of taxes and graphs to show what the house and surroundings are doing, past and present sales.  Also what the list prices on the houses and what Zillow thinks they are should be selling for.  Most times the houses sell closer to Zillow estimates that what they agents listed the houses for. Great App	1
I cannot express in words how awesome this dvd set is. They did an excellent job with it in every way. The sound will blow you away, especially if you have a 5.1 system (you don't need it, there is a regular stereo sound option too) but the surround sound is insane.The extras are all top notch - stuff you actually want to watch. I have to say that this is probably the best music DVD purchase I have ever made - the content, the packaging the little booklet - it's all of the highest quality. Very highly recommended!	6
This is a very nice street hockey set.  The sticks are very durable and they assemble fast with a phillips screwdriver.  The net is assembled by pressing the PVC tubes into the corner joints; Easy to do!  Both sticks work for left or right handers: Only slightly can you notice that one is for left and the other is for right.  However, we have all kinds of neighbor kids use them and they NEVER are concerned about the &#34;proper&#34; fitting of the stick.  They just use them....PERIOD!  Again, a great product and price.	20
"WOW!Underdog is one of those shows that doesn't get nearly the attention it deserves.  It's been decades since I've seen or heard anything about the show.  As such, I was surprised at all the little gems hidden in these classic shows.  I loved seeing things like Simon Barsinister ""The meanest man in the world"", creating machines to help him ""rule the world"".  Do you remember some of them?  Like his machine designed to shrink everyone in the world to 6 inches tall?  ""With my new shinking gun, I'll be the tallest man in the world!""It was great re-living those great memories again."	15
We've been using this tub since our son was about 6 months old.  At first we used the infant position which worked great.  We got this when he was younger but since it doesn't have any padding we used instead a different tub until he was able to somewhat sit up (maybe he wouldn't have cared, but it looked painful).  After a year, he is still using it and fits perfectly in it. The tub went through a lot of banging, crayola drawing and stuff like that, but it looks great, and works like new.  The stopper has never leaked!	3
THis Disc is Rich in Sound&amp;Quality.Miles Plays with Such Passion&amp;Energy.His Band is Very Top Notch as well.Strong Chemistry makes for Classic Music.this is in a Long,Long,Long, Line Of Great Albums  From this Genius.Not Only Was He Banging on His Instrument but His Genius  at getting the Right Players is Amazing as well.Nobody Before or Since has  had as Many Great Players Alongside as Miles.Maybe Duke Ellington&amp;James  Brown but Overall You Gotta Give Miles The Edge at Having the Best Talent  Around.He is The MAN!	9
I am listening to it right now. KC doesn't compromise. They are the Wagner of rock.Buy this and the complete King Crimson catalogue. If you don't like it, one of your grandkids will. Like lots of great music, King Crimson isn't appropriately revered in its time. One day, you'll be able to walk into any bar and there will always be least one Crimhead in the room.Music is my life. The music I am most passionate about is King Crimson.KC forever!	6
WW says, &quot;if you bite it, write it!&quot;  That is just one of the strengths of this app-wherever I am, I have a huge database of foods to help log my intake accurately.  More important than the numbers is being mindful of what I eat, appropriate portioning, and nutritional values.  I can track my progress by weight, nutritional ratios, and other measurements.  This app does far more than I use.  Think I'll invite a friend to join me!	1
Sturdy, durable and sleek.  In three words that sums up this wastebasket; it is just fantastic.  Most of my organizers and other office equipment are black and mesh and this coordinates perfectly with them.  Rubbermaid and Rolodex both intermix well especially in this black mesh design.  Comparing prices between local stores and Amazon have this product priced nearly the same.  I bought this at my local store to have it quicker however it's cost effective at the current price of under $10 no matter where you buy it.	17
I paid extra for Carhartt pants for their &#8220;legendary&#8221;wear properties and made-in-USA origin, and their pants wore out prematurely, and production was moved to China.So I tried the more blue-collar Dickies. They look better, they fit better, they have a much better pocket design, and so far they seem to be wearing better. We'll see over the long term but so far I'm happy with them. They're made in Mexico, an improvement, I guess, over China. Not much seems to be made here other than cars, kitchen/laundry appliances, and Mac Pros...	8
I have a moderate case of KP that seems to be getting worse with age.  I bought this lotion at the store a week ago and after using it for just a few days, my arms look so much better.  I'm hoping if I continue to use it, the KP will go away completely.  So far, it's the only thing that has helped this condition.  I didn't have very high hopes for it but it is worth a shot if you are suffering from KP.	12
The armband is hard and is exact fit for my iPhone 3GS. That seems to be a good news; but it makes it quite hard to put iPhone inside and take it out. Would not recommend if you are going to swap your phone in and out frequently. Also once phone is in, there is no way to access volume buttons. Only way to control volume is through the screen and that is absolutely not convenient. Overall, its good enough for its price; but I wouldn't have mind paying a bit more and getting a better band.	7
This Bore Snake has a sort of nylon brush in the center rather then the brass on used on fire arms. It does a great job and much easer to use then cleaning pellets. No chance of scratching the barrel, works much better then a rod.Air Gun barrels are made of a softer metal then Fire Arms so using a conventional boar snake is not a good idea for air guns. This is a great solution.I also use this in my .22 air rifle as it seems to do a good job with them also.	20
It is a testimony to my self-induced boredom that I purchased still another season of this repetitive series.  I could just watch Season 1 over and over again and save the money.  There is so much predictability, particularly in the repetitive gruesome and erroneous torture of wrongly-diagnosed patients until AHA! the dream team comes up with the real answer.  Were I one of those patients, I would have requested euthanasia far before they got to the AHA!  The fact that the entertainment value comes from a rude, crude, mean-spirited man ... well, that just is a sad commentary.	0
I absolutely love this app!!!  It has really helped me keep a closer eye on what I am eating and just how much to eat. Most every food has been preprogrammed in the app and it is so easy to find what you are looking for, even restaurant foods are easy to find!!!  In just 2 weeks time I have lost 8 pounds by using this app and walking for 20 minutes 3 days a week!  That is so manageable even in a very busy life!  Hope Springs for 2013 using this app!!	1
I am watching it now and really enjoying it. Canadian show from the Sci=Fi channel That was recommended to me. After the first 8 shows, I ordered the second season. Like Murder She Wrote, this is set in a small town in main. Here at least there are some reasons given for all that is going on from the long term point of view. Cabot Cove just seemed to heve to many people being murdered each episode. The show started to take place elsewhere after awhile wich was a good move to keep the show moving forward.	0
It might seem expensive, but the quality is excellent, and I can tell it will last for years and years.  The sieve is very fine and holds a lot--great for my making yogurt cheese and baking needs.  Really love this, and the handle is very comfortable, too (as are most OXO tools).  The little tip on the opposite side is terrific for supporting it in a bowl, something I consider essential but many sieves don't have.  This was worth every penny!	13
I have used these filters for quite some time.  Hard to find parts for them.  BUT fortunately the filter cartridges are sized for multiple filters.  I will actually be just dumping the carbon out of them into the trash.  You can cut it with a razor blade and dump out the carbon before it gets wet.  Then you can slide in a purigen pack in it.http://www.amazon.com/Seachem-165-Purigen-100ml/dp/B0002A5VK2/ref=pd_sim_petsupplies_5Then throw some Seachem BIO Matrix in some mesh baggies and throw an air bubbler under the BIO Matrix and you're all set.In my case I do it through the media trays.	19
I'm a big Zep fan and I really enjoyed the re-mixed 2 CD set of The Song Remains the Same, which just came out.  This DVD is a new release too....but why isn't it available directly from Amazon?  They ran out??  It just came out, and it is a major release (I thought...). They must want everybody to go for the Blu-Ray or Hi-Def versions.  But what if you don't have the type of player?  What happened to the regular DVD???  Someone straighten me out here....	6
This stuff will raise the ammonia level in your aquarium extremely, make the water cloudy and kill your fish. It does NOT neutralize ammonia, nitrate or nitrite. I do NOT recommend this product at all. I have always used Prime and for some reason decided to try this. Big mistake! I highly recommend Prime, it is much better for your aquarium and fish. It removes chlorine, chloramine, ammonia and detoxifies nitrite and nitrate and provides an excellent slime coat. If you want your fish to live and do well use Prime by Seachem, not this!!	19
I have Tweetcaster, Hootsuite &amp; the so-called Twitter app (the last actually being little more than a bookmarks to launch the browser &amp; take you to the twitter site on the web) on my Kindle Fire. Of the three, Tweetcaster works best &amp; is the one I use most often. Unlike Hootsuite, it does not offer to post directly to LinkedIn, but it does direct post to Twitter or Facebook or both. It is hard to describe why, but this app just functions better than the others named. If you tweet, get it!	1
Sometimes, we all wish we could tie our significant other up and just make them listen. InSerious Moonlight (Widescreen), Meg Ryan acts on that instinct. The result is a pretty good balance of funny and emotional. I wouldn't say this is the funniest movie I've ever seen - not by a long shot - but it is probably one of the funnier romantic comedies. In a genre otherwise filled with dry and cliched films,Serious Moonlightis original and takes surprising turns. Certainly worth checking out if you like romantic comedies.	0
I bought all three sizes of the Oxo Good Grips Tongs. These tongs are INDESTRUCTIBLE!!  Between my husband, two sons, and myself cooking in the kitchen through out the day and night, if these were any other brand, they would have never lasted. I've had all three of my OXO Tongs for years now and have never needed replacing! WELL WORTH the $. These tongs are very, very reasonably priced. HIGHLY RECOMMEND!!  These are one of those things I can't live without. I use them all the time for all kinds of cooking and baking.	13
This is not a great movie truth be told. However, it is an interesting look at the styles and themes popular in the late 70s. For those who were not alive, the clothing and styles in this movie are very representative of the disco style. The music is good, and there are a few genuine laughs. Cinema buffs will find it interesting to see Jeff Goldblum and Debra Winger before they were stars.As long as you go in without high expectations, and you are looking for mild entertainment, the 70s style is worth a look.	15
I have been using Canon inks and printers for years and awhile back, I decided to try out some of those generic ink tanks and ink kits (you know, the ones with the syringes?). Both ruined my printer, after awhile. They seem to work initially, but you can tell the colors are off. Sure, the generic inks are so much cheaper, but the costs of getting a new printer are going to make up for those few $ you saved on ink. Trust me on this one, buy Canon OEM cartridges!	17
This toy is just great! I originally bought one from Target (on sale for about $2.00) and my dog just feel in love w/ this him. He was playing with him, sleeping with him and he has to have Mr. Bill next to him at all times for next few days... Then somehow, we lost him.... so I had to buy him another Mr. Bill! He still loves to play with him and I think the sound he makes is just great! :) Totally recommend this product to any dog owners.. My dog is a 15 lb maltipoo btw	19
For Any Long Time Fan of Diana Ross, there is no need to review the base of what makes up this Lp. However what is so great is that once again Andy Skrow and George Solomon have put together a fan's dream, a complete look at the Lp! On this double cd, the tracks that were left out and the Alternate Version's of songs from the Project are all included. Like ALL of their past releases there are wonderful liner notes and alternate photo's from the photo shoot. Supreme Job Guys!!!!!NEXT!!!!!!!!	9
I own some high end cans and I.E.M.'s. These were bought as a walk around the house headphone. The big thing is: How does Koss generate such a rich sound out of an inexpensive headphone? I wish Koss was still in the market as a high end headphone producer, but if you need the best for what these cost, go no further!!! Be a little careful when taking them off because the earpods will snap together quickly due to the metal head band. They're light, comfy and can be somewhat adjusted for head pressure.I love em!!	10
Sound of Koss portapros is truly remarkable.  Great sound for any price!  My one complaint is that they are a little heavy and not quite as comfortable as I would like.  Works best when clips on side of each headphone are pushed back for loosest fit.  Also, wish the headphones were a little more portable.  They don't really fold up as small as I would like.  Lest I sound like too great a critic, I would purchase them again.  In fact, I sent my son-in-law a pair for Christmas.	10
"My son is 7 months old...we've been using it since he was approx. 1 month. We used one of those ""bear"" shaped bath sponges to support him a little when he was tiny, but we're still using this tub and we love it! He's now able to sit up and play in it. I can see we'll be using it for a while! It's a good investment. It is large....you'll need space to store it or in our case we just keep it in the tub in our extra bathroom! You and your baby will love it!"	3
LLego his fast. on time and very good.Marineland congratulate for your great years of experience and performance in its class and all materials. I consider that there are some better products. But this filter is the best, has good consistency is big enough and long.I bought it to make the penguin 100 filter replacements. Simply cut and paste box with quick-drying glue (obviously add some activated carbon inside) ... and ready ..and you save a lot ...Easy, practical, simple, very fast. I recommend it.	19
The other day I needed to mount a paper towel holder in my kitchen.  I have had a hard time in the past trying to drill into our kitchen cupboards, so I used this tape instead.  I was only able to use 2 small pieces about 1 inch each in length.  It has now been up all week!  I am impressed.  Most of the time I usually thing that tape is just tape and I've had mixed experiences with tape of this type. But, with this tape I am pleased!	17
"Siouxsie SIoux..We salute..I danced so hard..""Hong Kong Garden""..Early Siouxsie was this..Raw crunchy guitars that spoke with her idealistic lyrics..Disco in ""Israel""..Siouxsie was beautiful then and now..Artsy and new wave in ""Christine"", and ""Arabian Nights"" the first of these songs being an artful part punk part new wave mish mash..""Tinderbox"" is the other album that shines..Be 17 again..Go buy ""Once Upon A Time"" and get the history and the attitude of youth that keep our world alive..Hey Rick and Colleen remember me? Let's start a punk band.."	9
The image seems to show a black rubberized grip further down on the handle, mine doesn't have that.  It is however very very strong, as an example we used it to lever up a rather large cement fountain base full of water so we could level it out, and the shovel was a champ(maybe not smart but it was the only tool for the job).  I will say that this shovel is heavy, heavier than the standard wood handled ones.  For light gardening I will still need to order one not quite so serious.	18
I cant wait to see and buy the 5th season. We watched and bought all 4, and sold them, the day after we watched them, instantly. This is what tv and entertainment should be like and isnt! The acting is superb! The characters amazing and believable! they take something that I didnt think Id be interested in and just made it real, even though, it is is so unbelievable, but you KNOW and love or hate all of the characters, and the love and hate changes and is soooooooooo believable! Cudos to these guys, for real!	0
I enjoyed this little foray into the psyches of some very sick tickets. SK #1 is male, picks up hitchhikers, does his thing, and burns/blows up the evidence. SK #2 is female, hitchhikes, does her thing, and abandons the evidence. What happens when they meet is interesting, to say the least. The author of this little gem has the idea of Chekov's gun down pat - when you see something, it's important. It's always the little details, you know?Not for the kiddos - it's gruesome even though it is not overly explicit. And hey, free is *always* my favorite price!	14
I hope they continue to make more. The pace and acting is great, I also love the plot lines. They aren't the usual cookie cutter stories hollywood turns out, these actually have depth, the characters also have depth. Clearly the fans love it to put up the money to make it. Maybe now some smart producer/director/studio will see the wisdom of developing stories for Amazon. This is the first time I've heard of a film being made to order for fans, and I hope it's not the last.	0
These are the Best clamps (at the price i paid, $ 20 bucks a piece) for installing and clamping any glue down or together or even &#34;click&#34; flooring and keeping it in place while workin all day. They have heald up for over 10 years and while the little wall button has fallen off most of them I just use a plastic ship and they work great and Bessey makes some of the best clamps in the world.A &#34;must Have&#34; for glue down or together floors. Useful for even &#34;clic&#34; type flooring that tends to spread on occasion.	21
We took a pair of these out camping this past weekend. Two twin air mattresses do not fit in our tent, so I would take my ultra light back thermarest and was too thin.  So I got this and tried it out on our living room floor.  Worked great, so I got my wife one.  Its comfortable and doesnt take up a bunch of room.The downside is the valve makes it tough to use pumps.  You basically have to either jimmy rig your pump or blow it up manually.. also deflating takes longer than most other sleeping pads.	20
There's definitely some oomph missing from this season, with Tommy being weak and helpless much of the time.  Colleen has become completely stupid and annoying.  And I miss Jack McGee.However, the Jewish fire chief is wonderful, Tommy's soliloquy about Connor, given while sitting on the edge of a tall building, is excellent; and there are still interesting stories and subplots--enough of them to make it worth watching the show.May I just add that the cover art of Leary on the DVD box set is freaky?	0
I am thrilled with the quality of these earrings and so glad that with 14k gold, they are still quite affordable.The stones are excellently matched in color and just the perfect shade of brown that goes with anything.  They stand out on the lobe and I was worried they'd be really small, but they are not.  In spite of the decent size of the stones, these are really lightweight and you can't tell you're wearing them, at all.I think these would make an excellent gift and I'm considering buying an additional pair, just for that purpose!	8

I've had this radio for over 3 years now and the only problem is with the FM tuner (it died in less than one year).  It still works with AM, weather, and TV.  Since I use it for primarily AM, it's not a big deal.  Speaking of AM, this has absolutely the best AM reception of any radio I've had.One last comment: the batteries last quite a while.  I use it at least 20 - 30 mintues a day and have only replaced the batteries once in three years.If you're looking for a shower radio, this is it!	10
Bought this to use with my iPhone 3GS. When I plugged it in, I got the 'not for iPhone' charging message. Sure enough, it doesn't charge properly. The problem is that, even when I've taken care to make sure it's securely seated, it won't consistently charge, so there's no telling with any certainty when you unplug your phone in the morning, that it'll be charged.Callpod charges my old LG phone, my husband's Blackberry and my Nintendo DS, all flawlessly.  This adapter was a bust. Haven't tried it with my husband's iPod Touch, so can't say how it works for that device.	7
"Very imaginative book! It was a page turner and I couldn't wait to see what would happen next.However, I don't think I've yet read a Kindle book in which the author understood the difference between the verbs ""to lay"" and ""to lie."" This book was no exception. Example...""when they're laying low."" No! ...""when they're lying low."" Except for a couple of typos, these were the only errors - ""will"" for ""with"" and ""passed"" for ""past.""I thoroughly recommend this book."	14
"After reading several reviews, I think that many readers may have missed the entire point of ""Water for Elephants"".  Some reviewers said that the book didn't say much about circus life and some say they did not care about learning about the circus. ""WFE"" teaches us that it is ok to rememeber fondly those most rewarding experiences throughout your life but also that it is never too late to create new experiences.  It also provides us with a unique perspective of everyday life in a senior living facility...a place that many of us may end up in one day."	5
I've been purchasing this product over the course of a decade and still love it. It's similar to ArmorAll but doesn't leave a thick, oily residue. I mostly use this when detailing cars since it literally brings a nice, like-new sheen to interior plastics (particually dashboards and interior plastic door panels). On occasion, it can smell like REALLY bad B.O. (body odor) but its because the product has sat too long. I recommend buying small bottles if you won't use a lot of it in a year or two time unless you don't mind the smell.	20
Sure this was written decades before I was born but the stories are no less terrifying for their age. Lovecraft is surely a step above contemporary horror writers in so many ways. The guy does not have to use a plethora of vulgar language, nauseating scenes of sexual violence, or even hundreds of pages to scare the senses out of the reader. Not all of his stories are entertaining but I dare say ninety-nine percent are. If you like your scares in bite-size pieces give this collection of Lovecraft's stories a try.	14
Since the update of Amazon mp3 player, many of the songs I purchased thru Amazon, and downloaded thru Amazon, will not play.  I get &#34;exception 119&#34; or other playback errors.  This is annoying in and of itself, but when using the player during a run or workout, it completely stops the player, meaning I have to finish the run/workout without music, or break my pace/concentration to skip to the next song.Getting a paltry number of &#34;free&#34; (for prime) songs to choose from doesn't override the inconvenience of a player that doesn't play.....	1
While I have not used the Hoppe's .38-.45 caliber patches yet, I just finished using the .22-.270 caliber size in my .223 rifle and the .270-.38 caliber size in my .308. THEY ARE REDICULOUSLY SMALL AND THEREFORE WASTEFUL. I needed 3 patches to feel any correct resistance in my .223, and 2.5 of the .270/.38 patches in my .308! Stick with the Pro-Shot cotton patches, also sold here as well. They will be far cheaper in the long run because you only need one patch per swipe instead of three.  Pro-Shot is best.....Outers is acceptable.....Hoppe's fail the test.	20
I spent over an hour trying to decide which paper to buy this round. I really hate spending money on sand paper, but it's so important. I'm a hobbyist woodworker.I decided to take a change on Mirka because of the reviews and I was thrilled with the decision. I bought a box of each grit. This paper works just fine. As well or better than my Norton in my nonscientific evaluation. I used it extensively on a walnut blanket chest project over the course of several days and found it to be quite durable.You will not be disappointed with this paper!	21
As my husband and I have a predelection for fine cuisine and having  studied with a few world's renounced chefs and aficionados of Mexican Cuisine, I guarantee this cookbook's recipes will delight even the most fastidious palate. The easy-to-follow recipes are ever bit as appetizing and appealing they appear in the exquisite photographs. Even a novice cook will look like pro with the savoir-faire of authentic Mexican cuisine.  I strongly recommend this book for gift-giving.  (I actually own a copy and use it.)	5
When I first heard QUIT PLAYING GAMES on the radio, I went crazy trying to find out who sung it.  Who had every heard of THE BACKSTREET BOYS anyway?  Well no one is asking that question anymore, since these great looking,  talented young guys have risen in the music world and can sell out a  stadium in less than 10 minutes!  This cd contains all their popular hits  from the late nineties.  You'll sing along and dance and really enjoy  adding this to your &quot;favorites&quot; collection.  And of course,  MILLENNIUM is out of this world too!	9
This is the first app I have tried from the Amazon App store, and as it turned out, this was a good place to start. It works amazingly well on my HTC Inspire 4G, and it is not complicated to learn to maneuver through it and find what you want to hear. There are so many good choices for listening. I was a little disappointed to find out that my two local hometown stations aren't there, but then a message in the app told me that they have not been made available for streaming.	1
My bottle of Tuscan Whole Milk descended in a godlike spot of light through the roof of my house; such dramatization in delivery was well worth the cost of shipping. As if that wasn't awe-inspiring enough, the bottle proceeded to unscrew its own cap, peel off its shimmering film lid and then poured its contents into a glass that inexplicably appeared in my hand which was clenched in gripping astonishment. Without further hesitation, I drank it down with great pleasure, having just consumed the best beverage known to man next to gorilla snot.	11
I love that they have a variety of different game options contained in one game.  I'm disappointed that this seems to be for younger aged children then specified.  My son just turned 3 in December and there really isn't much of a challenge for him.  He loves the Goodnight Moon book so we thought this would be a fun gift that would challenge him and encourage his cognitive learning, however, it fell short of the mark as far as we were concerned.  It is a cute game but for a younger child.	22
If you love the peppery flavor of ginger, this tea is for you.  The longer the tea bag sits, the stronger the ginger taste.  What I like best about it is the true ginger flavor.  I've tried other brands and they just aren't as potent.Whether you drink it strictly for taste or use it to soothe your stomach, this one's a great choice.  If you're drinking it just for enjoyment, try this:  steep your tea, allowing the bag to sit in the water until it's cool.  Add honey, stir, and pour over ice.  Delicious!	11
The manufacturer says to use their ink in their printer. Of course they are going to say that, but is it for a real reason, or just so they can make more money? I don't know.I go with the real thing, and haven't had any problems. Maybe I wouldn't have any problems with refills or generic brands, but the small difference in price doesn't make the experiment worthwhile to me. I'd rather pay a little more for this genuine HP cartridge than take a chance in causing a problem with my printer.	20
My kittens love this food and they certainly seem to be growing at healthy rate. My adult male cat doesn't really eat it but he's always preferred dry food so I buy this for the younger ones and their mother.  Mom and the litter were abandoned so I'm not sure what she was fed before but she seems to really like the food and its put some much needed weight on her. They seem to really like this flavor and the beef and chicken. Both are a bit smellier and oiler then the others but that's probably what they like.	19
I just got this product yesterday.  I used it to clean out 4 of my water bottles and their lids.  Along with a long handle, the brush has bristles that stick up on the top and allow me to clean the bottome of the bottle very easily.  The brush also cleaned up under the rim of the bottles easily due to the direction of the bottom bristles.  It rinsed off easily and dried quickly.  So far, so good.  If it falls apart within 6 months I'll revise my review; otherwise I'd recomend it for cleaning water bottles/baby bottles/etc.	12
It's really not a 200w system.  The booklet even says it is only 100 watts, and I doubt it is really even that powerful.  The wireless microphone only works when you put your mouth about an inch from it.  My Shure XLR wired microphones do not work with it even with an adapter plug.  The instrument input works OK with my Taylor guitar, but it's not 100 watts loud.  I guess it's OK as a portable guitar amp in a small venue without any vocals.	16
Like many Sci-Fi novels, Red Mars has two stories to tell - a story of science (the terraforming and colonization of Mars), and a story of people (the adventures of the Mars colonists).  The first story is fascinating and  thought-provoking, the second is uninteresting.  Put them together and you  have a really good book that could have been great.  If, like me, you're  interested in seeing what the future might be like, you'll enjoy the book,  but if what you're looking for is an interesting story, look elsewhere.	5
I researched a ton of portable air compressors before coming to the conclusion that the Q Industries, a veritable no-name brand, compressor was the best value - without spending a fortune.  While I think it is obvious your best option for portable air compressors is a Viar, they are also very expensive.  This Q Industries compressor provides me with a relatively quick air-up without a huge expense.  Reviews elsewhere have me convinced it will last a while too.The few times I've used it thus far has me convinced I made a good choice.  I can recommend this one too.	2
This is the BEST THANKSGIVING special around...and I am not just saying that because I am the RANKIN/BASS Historian.  The sound on this VHS is magnificent and it should be on DVD!  I have the original GAS LP Soundtrack on CD.  MAURY LAWS and JULES BASS did a wonderful job with the score.  ELBOW ROOM, sung by TENN. ERNIE FORD was part of the RANKIN/BASS off-Broadway play A MONTH OF SUNDAYS, before it was put to GREAT use in this special!  A GREAT Special!  E-mail me with any questions:  Rickgoldsc@aol.com	15
not bad, if you dont use any batteryand use a 9vdc adapter thingie...make sure thingie outputs at least500 mA if you can ...tried mic, bass, and electric guitar and keyboardsthru this thing...all workand the distortion control... mostlly notnecessary for me, but others will find thatcontrol  is use ful too...it is a cutie and works for fun,and u might get loudness around 90 dBA onsome frequencies...  not bad at all...even got a headphone connect on it forlate nite playing...a good thing. for the price it is worth...	16
You would normally think chick vocals don't fit with &quot;goth&quot; music, but Siouxsie does just the opposite.  She has a good voice that is never overdone behind somewhat-but-not-totally-gloomy guitars.  &quot;Kiss  them for me&quot; is really for me the oldest song I know by them, &amp;  I'm just now getting to know their older stuff.  &quot;Cities in Dust&quot;  &amp; &quot;This Wheel's on Fire&quot; have become my favorite tracks on  the cd.  Just be prepared to probably listen to the first half of the cd  over &amp; over before ever getting to the end of the cd, as that's what I  did.	9
"Back plate has a ""greenish"" tint, and is single ply, not 3-ply as advertised.Color wasnt as advertised, its more of an ""off-white"" than a vintage cream. But I guess its close enough considering the price.Shipping took far too long. (Not sure if Music123 or USPS is to blame for that, but Id go with USPS)Besides those minor faults, the items fit well and look good.My 2006 Strat now has the look of a '57, without the huge price tag."	16
A lot of people (myself included) complain about how expensive Avery labels are as compared to the competition. However, what you don't hear enough of is praise for their performance. So, I'll just say it: Avery labels perform better than the compettion. They adhere better, they're thicker, they block out what is underneath better, and they don't peel of the backing and ruin your expensive office printer. Quite simply, for laser or injet labels, Avery is the clear winner in quality and performance. You get what you pay for.	17
My miniature pinscher Bella has this little bear and a little duck.  Both of them she's had since she was a baby, 9 months ago and both of them are still in great condition.  They last a long time!  She has torn up many toys in the past but these have held up with no problem at all!  They are definitely two of her favorite toys!  They are very small though, don't buy them if you have a larger dog at all, I think they are just best for toy breed dogs, Bella is 6 pounds.	19
If you like music of the Strauss family, this is a superb concert with great sound from 1987. The concert lasts about 90 minutes, with very few  interruptions between pieces. The camera is mostly on the orchestra and  conductor (who looks like he is on his last legs) and the playing is  incredibly beautiful.  Kathleen Battle is on stage for the &quot;Voices of  Spring&quot; waltz and has a perfect coloratura for the part.  The sound on  the DVD is great and the program notes are good too.  This is a definite  buy.	6
"I have 2 packs in different sizes. On the package it's advertized as a burp cloth. I've used it over a pillow on my lap, but it's too stiff to use over your shoulder. It's good at trapping moisture and keeping the surface beneath from getting wet or damp. It stayed strong after several washes. I used to lay my daughter on it to protect her mattress or sheets, but I find that it doesn""t breathe well enough and when she had baby acne it made the break-outs much worse."	3
I've had this tape for a little over a year, and I still reach for it quite often. The instructor is warm and friendly and explains how to get into each pose with percision. I always feel loose and relaxed after doing this workout. This is the tape that made me want to try even more yoga tapes to expand my practice! I recommend it to everyone I know just starting out. The price can't be beat and neither can the style. Although I have aquired more tapes recently, this tape will stay in my yoga practice for a long time to come!	15
Maidenform's bra was labeled the correct size, but when my wife compared them to another bra that they sent her you could see that it was an inch and a half shorter in length, and the cup size was smaller too so it did not fit.  They said over the phone they could do an exchange, then when we paid $10 to ship it to them they said 5 weeks later that they do not do exchanges.  They have no consistency in their bra sizes, and they have terrible customer service support.	8
We recently moved into a new house and bought and installed 3 of these gates. Within one week, our 13 month old broke two of the gates. Once by holding onto the rungs and shaking the gate the other time by grabbing one of the rungs when he tripped.Both times the rung popped right out breaking at the top and bottom. This left a gap in the rungs wide enough for our son to stick his head through which means he could get past the gate if we kept it up (which of course we didn't.)	3
These are neat looking suspenders.  I bought them for my husband, and he had not worn them very much.  Today, the snaps came apart, and they are no good any more.  Hope you have better luck with yours.  First pair of suspenders I've ever seen do that.Update:  I wrote the above because I was unhappy when they broke.  However, they replaced them immediately and the new pair seem to be fine.  I love the design!!!!	8
When I first bought my Samsung Galaxy tablet, I used Radio.com exclusively and looked no further. But, after 3 years of using that app and enduring the countless &#34;improvements&#34; and &#34;upgrades&#34; to that app, I finally deleted it, downloaded THIS one and am glad for it! No silly nonsense of endless &#34;loading...loading...loading&#34; or &#34;Buffering...Buffering...Buffering&#34; as the Radio.com app became, this one goes right to the preset station I listen to and works flawlessly.Good Bye Radio.com, Hello TuneIn Radio! :D	1
This is the first time I have ever seen this movie. I've had the soundtrack for a long time I loved it. When I started the movie I heard the title song it made me wanna dance. This movie is so hilarious and the music is fantastic. Donna Summer made my mouth drop cuz she can act and sing. I loved her and I loved all of the different characters especially the good girl who is accident prone laugh out loud. This dvd is deffenitly worth getting and put it as a collectors item but can watch it.	15
At first, I was a bit leary about buying one of these, because I had heard that they were never loud enough unless you were in a very quiet place. NOT TRUE! I have to say I've had to turn down the volume on this before! Now, don't take that out of context, but this is a great product. I live in Texas and drive a loud truck, and I've been able to use this product driving down the road! I would definitely recommend this product. A great purchase for the money.	7
"The price is right, and the product is great.  My Mom is a senior with COPD and other serious health issues, and this has been a life saver for her.  She can soak as long as she wants to help her feel ""refreshed.""  We use a small tub, filled with fragrant bubble bath, to soak her feet, and this methods lets her maintain her dignity, when she can't make it upstairs to take a full tub bath.  When this one cracks or begins to wear out, I will certainly buy another.God bless the inventor of the Sitz bath!!!"	12
Both of my boys (1 and 2.5) love stacking and building.  They also love cars.  So this was an obvious choice for a great toy for them.  They both love these cars!  All of the cars have a little &quot;surprise&quot; (the ladder on the firetruck &quot;clicks&quot; as it raises up and down, the siren on the police car spins, etc.) &amp; they are all numbered which is great for counting and number recognition as they get older.  They're also a great way to teach abstract concepts like smallest, bigger, biggest.	3
I do not use these as diapers, but I couldn't live w/o them.  When my baby was really little, I used them on the changing pad to keep from having to change the changing pad cover constantly.  These are much easier to change and wash than those covers.  These are also the best burp cloths.  My daughter has really bad acid reflux, and not many burp cloths can stand up to a good spit up.  I go through about 5 a day.  They are VERY absorbant!	3
For those who don't know this is the very first Spyro game. This is such an awesome game.Pros1. The Graphics-Given it is for the PS1 they are a little outdated, but looking back they are comical.2. The Story-The game is engaging and keeps you playing all the time3. The Dialogue-Absolutely funny and genius since [Spoiler Alert!] the reason Gnasty Gnorc (the main villain) freezes the dragons is because the dragons call him ugly.4. There are mini-games you can go back to after beating the game.Cons1. I can't think of any	23
I cant play real guitars ....... but i did buy this for Rock Band. This is perfect with the boom i can sing and play without the stand getting in the way. This has so many adjustment spots no one will have a problem getting a good position with it. I even use it when im drumming. I highly recommend this for real players or even plastic players.  Well this one is actually better than most of the ones my wifes band has.  Oh its almost impossible to knock down too, believe me the cats have tried.	16
This concert has its moments... I saw the group live in 1985 touring after 'Brothers In Arms' was released and that concert was definitely better than this one... also saw them live in 1988 with Eric Clapton.On the debit side, Mark Knopfler's vocals are rather weak at times on 'Alchemy', and he has a tendency to change the lyrics. This version of 'Romeo And Juliet' is a stinker.  The best tracks by far are 'Sultans of Swing', 'Tunnel of Love' and most of all 'Telegraph Road'.	6
Twisted Metal 2 is the best playstation game ever!  The levels are fun because they are so different from one another.  Each level provides interactive fun!  The cars are great and the specials weapons are excellent!  The ending movies, like the tital suggests are twisted. I do not find this game offensive in any way and I think it good for responsible kids ages 8 and up. Everyone should buy this game.  It is the best of the four Twisted Metal games!  You will love it!	23
I use a lot of Cream of Tartar.I make my own baking powder, which requires only a limited amount, but I use it much more for cleaning certain items.I collect vintage cookware.  Often aluminum pots, pans, roasters and etc., have very dark interiors from cooking certain foods.Filling the vessel with water and adding 3 or 4 Tablespoons of Cream of Tartar and boiling the liquid for 20 - 30 minutes (occasionally longer) will bring the aluminum back to the bright, silvery color it was when new.	11
I've been wearing Levi 501s for over 25 years. By mistake I ordered these 505s instead of 501s. It took a little getting used to having a zipper instead of button fly. Actually I think the zipper may help increase the life of my jeans. Over time the buttons have tended to wear the buttonholes on my 501s making them a little loose.These 505s fit just as well as my 501s have fit over many years. I'll almost certainly continue to buy Levis for the next 25 years. The only question will be: 501 or 505?	8
I have an assortment of storage boxes from plastic to lightweight cardboard and the Bankers Box R-Kive Heavy-Duty Storage Boxes are top of the line in cardboard.  Easy to assemble, these have a flap on the lid ends (or sides if you use the box in legal format) which &#34;lock&#34; inside the box base handle cutouts.  Whereas some other Bankers boxes have blue printing, these are totally black ink on the white cardboard.  They are more sturdy than any others I use and I am secure in stacking these from the ground up.  I definitely recommend these boxes.	17
Not a cinch to put together - just so you know &#34;part F&#34; is IN the long tube - don't look for it!  Just start by screwing the long tubes together - this IS step one.  The rest is figure it out as you go - the instructions aren't great - but it winds up being a decent cart.Not meant to lean on, feel a LITTLE tippy - but nothing that interfere with normal functioning.  There are two locking breaks on two of the wheels so you might want to note that before deciding which wheels go where.	17
I find that I have to change the foam every few weeks in order to maintain fit and achieve maximum quality.  The sound quality is amazing, except for the lows.  As others have mentioned, the bass is lacking in this pair.  I originally had a pair of Shure e3c which I found to be overall better than these.  Even the Shure case was better.  I wanted to try these out because of all the raving reviews.  While they are very good earphones, the Shure's may be better.	7
Aislinn's story is a touching one, full of hope and pain, high aspirations and sweet romance.  This book follows her trials as she fights to become a female knight, the first in her kingdom.  Though she meets her share of bullies, those on her side are loyal friends who help her through it all (when she'll let them).  Aislinn is a strong little girl, determined, and willing to do whatever it takes to become a lady knight.Zoltack creates a vibrant world that allows the reader to forget what century they're living in.  The kingdom and castle were made very real to the reader.	14
I've used these wipers now for around 2 months and they have held up through fall and winter weather without any major issues. As many other reviews note these wipers do miss a spot on the lower right passenger side but it is not a big issue. I did have a problem with my wiper popping off when I was lifting it and pushing it onto my windshield to break ice off of it. I was able to put it back on no problem but it made me a bit nervous it could happen again.	2
This is a book that kept me up until 3 a.m because I was enjoying it so much.  I cracked up so many times, I lost count.  It's like Stephanie Plum becomes a demon slayer.  The characters are snarky, hilarious and yet you still get to know the person.  I totally recommend this amazing read, but make sure you are somewhere where you won't get strange looks for laughing out loud.  I'm off to read the next one.  What a delightful series!	14
"I was amazed and brought to tears many times by this movie, it really showed the depths and breaths of Jesus' love for me and for the world. He's worth serving with all my heart, that is for sure.Mel Gibson did a fantastic job with this movie. Hopefully many lives will be changed. Go see it today!!Ignore the critics, it's not anti-semetic, it's not as violent as I thought it would be. For thoses who say it's a ""snuff film"" you are barking mad! It's all make-up people, it's not real!! But His love and  word are."	15
I bought this saw 22 years ago and have used it since. I am a professional electrician and use a circular saw from time to time on the job for wood braces and supports. The saw has never been serviced or repaired. Some 7 years ago, I bought a Freud carbide blade from Home Depot. That's all I've done to it, and it keeps on going and going.  When it no longer works, I'll get another. But, at the rate that it last and last, who knows when that will be.	21
this movie was very entertaining and right to the point. you don't have to wait that long to start seeing the monsters and the human acting is very well done. the only problem is that the trailer is in japanese but the movie ended up being an english dub. i would much rather have watched it in it's original form with subtitles, which i feel would have been more authentic.  however, it was still good and the dialogue still came across pretty well. if you enjoyed mothra i would say to check this out, it was definitely enjoyable.	15
"This stool is a miracle worker for tired legs and backs.  I love to use it when nursing my son upstairs.  The slanted top means your feet are positioned perfectly for holding a baby.  It's very sturdy and doesn't slide around on the floor like my daughter's plastic stools do.I did not get this until baby #2, and I wish I had had it with the first one!  Believe me, there is no comparison between rocking/nursing/holding a baby with this stool, or just resting your feet on the floor.Definitely in my ""top ten"" list of must-haves for breastfeeding."	3
We've used these for years but most recently, they've found another use in our household. My son has braces and has been using this to get around the braces to dig gunk out of his gum line and the brace brackets. He uses it in conjunction with hisWaterpik Ultra Water Flosser. At our first check-up with the orthodontist, he was told that his teeth look great and he's doing a great job keeping them clean!It's a great tool for getting around without damaging the braces and I continue to use mine as well.	12
My husband doesn't mind this, but I hate it and won't use it.  I will grab the pairing knife if our traditional stringed cheese cutter is dirty, before grabbing this.  It is too flimsy in my opinion (surprising really for Oxo), to do its job, and it very difficult to get to the end of your cut without removing a whole CHUNK of cheese from the end.  I guess the other reviewers are right - you are either one who loves cheese planes, or you don't :(.	13
We love this video. I love that it teachs my kids about babies, dogs, and farms. All three shows on this video are done very well. And I really can't say that with all Elmo's world shows. This video opens the way to talk to young kids about babies, dogs and farms. Which is great. I'm a home daycare provider. Over the yrs I have collected over 100 kids videos. Elmo's World - Babies, Dogs & More! seems to entertain my daycare kids ages 14 months to 5 yrs greatly. I'd say it's in the top 20 favorite videos of my daycare kids.	15
I'm training a puppy and he LOVES this.  I got the liver flavor.  My only complaint is that it doesn't last long, so it's a pricey &#34;treat&#34;.  It fills the kong toys well - put through the smaller bottom hole and use the toy to bend the nozzle and it fills up the toy nicely w/o mess.  It's cheapest on Amazon (from what I've seen so far).  But my pup has this polished off in no time at all, so it's only a short break while he's busy with the kong... I'll only use this for special rewards in the future	19
It didn't clean my hands, which weren't very dirty in the first place and it ruined my hair.Maybe it's just me, but I tried one *drop* for washing my hair. Even pre-mixed it with warm water. No amount of rinsing could get it out of my hair. It left my hair all greasy/oily. My hair was cleaner before I put this horrid stuff in it!Had to re-wash a FEW times with regular shampoo to get it all out.Now I don't dare use it on anything else. It's awful. Sitting on a shelf collecting dust.	20
This blade is simply the finest blade I have ever used in my Unisaw. I've tried many.Cheapies and expensive ones ,Delta Dewalt,Irwin, several Freuds and the list goes on and on. Forrest claims a smooth as sanded surface and  they are right. Since I made the switch ,I don't use my jointer as often. I  thought 40 teeth might be a little aggressive for veneers,but I was wrong.  The woodworker II does a fine job on them also. Do I have any complaints?  Only that I didn't start using them sooner.	21
Never had one of these before, and I love mine. Limit, as far as performance--can't take an SD card bigger than 2G (no SDHC cards), and only runs Windows Mobile 2003 SE. Still works great for what it does. Can connect via 802.11b to just about any hotspot available, and plenty of apps still floating around the net for Windows Mobile 2003, but if you have the money, as I didn't, I would suggest the Axim x50, the last of the Axim series Dell made.	10
A bit of a departure from his high tech thrillers.  While there is no shortage of high tech gadgets, they are not the focal point.  The focal point is the origin of the mysterious Mr. Clark.  Mr. Clark, who began life as John Kelly, is a highly trained and experienced Navy SEAL.  While home in the U.S., he crosses paths with a domestic drug ring.  If you've ever wondered what a highly trained commando could do to a bunch of ruthless thugs, this is your book.  I enjoyed every word of it.	5
"Yes, this tape does look great when wrapping presents. Yes, it disappears on gift wrapped surfaces. But that's not all. I use it for my ""everyday"" tape as well - great for small repairs when you need the tape to not leave a strange matte spot on the surface like ""regular"" tape. Did your kids rip yet ANOTHER page in their storybook? Scotch BiftWrap tape. Did you forget to put something in that pretty mailing envelope? Carefully unseal it, and then...Scotch GiftWrap tape. Crafts, scrapbooking, kids' projects? Scotch GiftWrap tape. I only wish that more tape came on the rolls."	17
Utilized these for our stairs and they work very well.  I was surprised how nice they looked once they arrived.  Being able to utilize a step to unlatch the gate is very nice to have, seeing as our kid or some other object seems to be in our hands every time we go up and down the stairs.However, we required two extensions on each of the gates we purchased in order to get to the appropriate width for our staircases so I would recommend making sure you measure your stairs before ordering this gate and the necessary extensions.	3
I finally ordered this after getting tired of hand scraping pastry off of the (clean) countertops when baking and I am very pleased with this purchase! It has so many uses. I now use it daily to scrape veggies and fruits off of the cutting board, scrape things off of the countertops, and for light chopping now and then. It is also excellent for cutting pizza (works better than my pizza cutter!), cutting sandwiches, just about anything! It's now my favorite kitchen utensil and I'm so glad I ordered it.	13
Recently found a really great Onkyo 3-head, 3-motor cassette deck for playing my old cassettes from years ago - for low dollars.  This is the best price I've seen on good normal bias tapes - the chrome (high bias, Type II) are just too pricey - but these sound just fine for all my music, whether rock, jazz, country or classical.  Getcha some before the Type I prices get stupid, too.  And enjoy some George Jones singing along with a Beethoven tune while David Sanborn blows his sax and Jimmy Page picks his axe.	10
This is one of my favourite albums of all time. The themes are consistent through-out the entire album, and references to DisneyLand are hidden through out. This is one of those cds you should have on a top 200 basis, especially if you love 90's music. The singles on this album are superb, but even the non-single tracks are awesome. The title track is epic. Also good are Happy Now, End it On This and World Go Round. Classic Ska, Classic 90's, and just good stuff all around.	9
I did not care much for the story.  It was before my time so I have no connection to the events. The big looser for me was the writing style. It was probably a well accepted style at the time but just does not fit in today. Hemingway changed his style several times in his life and this is just an example of a style that went astray.I enjoyed &#34;The old man and the sea&#34; which was written quite differenty. The fact that there was only one person involved made a difference.	5
She wanted a brush to clean off the bottoms of her shoes, so I bought her one of these. When I saw it, I decided I wanted one of these for myself too. This Oxo brush has a very comfortable handle and is angled just right. I like using it to clean those seams where sink meets wall and bathtub meets wall. Even the bristles are just the right mix of flexibility and stiffness so one doesn't have to worry about scratching surfaces.For the current price (five dollars) this great brush is a bargain.	12
I bought them at 45 dollars. Use for small music gigs and DJ/MC uses. They are great for DJ uses or other things where the quality of the voice isn't so important, as long as you can be heard and understood. I recommend for use of: 1. Small music venues (smaller bands), Djing, public speaking, band practices/rehearses, etc.For higher quality microphones at a reasonable price, look at the Audix OM2 when it's around 80 bucks, or Audio Technica products.	16
Saw a similar shoe in White House Black Market in the Spring, but didn't buy it.  When I went back, the shoe was gone, but that's alright ... it was over $100 there ...  Saw this shoe on line for less than half the price, and it was Bandolino, a great brand.  Got the shoe in time to take on an AK cruise, and I'm in love ...  Shoe is very comfortable and well worth the money.  I would highly recommend this shoe to anyone who is looking for a classic look and comfortable shoe!	8
Squirrels seem to give up very quickly on this feeder, as their weight closes off access to the feeder tray.  While that is a great, money-saving aspect of the feeder, and I really like the large size (fewer refills) and level-check windows, the downside of this type of feeder is that it limits visits from beautiful larger birds (woodpeckers, cardinals, blue jays, etc.  Finches, sparrows, and wrens seems to only visitors due to the small landing area it offers.	18
I wasn't certain whether 4 or 5 stars were warranted for this book.  It's very well written, but the subject matter makes for a very emotional, hard read.  As a cat lover, I hated the premise of this book.  But, it's a subject that needs more exposure; torture in the name of research.  Just don't leave this book lying around for a child to get into; it's not a Disney- or Seuss-style read.  I read it several months ago, and it's still in my memory banks, occasionally assaulting me at unguarded moments.	14
WOW this is a DVD?!?The show is as it was in the TV release and the extras do bring it to the modern day but I think they (Sony Wonder/Golden Books) could have packed all the shows on One DVD instead of making you buy  3 of them... Look to Warmer Bros. Year w/o Santa Claus...Santa Claus is Coming to Town and Frosty could have made it all in this DVD... Well I got it in the collection and saved some over buying them one at a time...Enjoy the show and worry where the popcorn money will come from later...	15
This series of books had  some of the best Vampire stories I've ever read.  Fast paced, great, lovable characters, and plenty of action, not to mention sexual tension throughout..real page turners.  They made me want to be part of  the &#34;family&#34;!  lol  I want to read the next series, but will probably have to wait till someone gives me a gift card.  The price on the second series is a little prohibitive for me.  On the other hand, these books are definitely worth it, if yo love to read about &#34;lovable vampires&#34;.	14
"I prefer games where I don't have to ""dummy down""  for the kids to have a chance of winning.  This is one of those games.  It is easy, fun, and short.  It saved my life when I was flying alone with the kids over Christmas break and we were stuck at the airport for two days.  We must have played 100 rounds of this, and noone got tired of it.  They still wanted to play more when we were safely at Grandma's house."	22
I suffer from dry hands... My own fault - I hate to wear rubber gloves when I do things. This lotion is a saver. It has NO water whatsoever and all the good stuff. So, a good sugar scrub and an application of this later, my hands look like I've never done any housework in my life. Highly recommended. I know it's a body lotion, but the rest of me is not dry enough to waste this on... It is rich, so if your legs are dry from shaving, it will probably save them too.	4
This wonderful OXO Good Grips Melon Baller is fantastic! Not only is it easy to use for cantaloupe & watermelon, it can also be used to make butter curls. I also use it to scoop the seeds out of fruit & veggies such as peppers. It's made of dishwasher safe stainless steel with a comfortable handle, so it's easy to hang on to and won't fly out of your hands if they're wet. I can definitely recommend this wonderful tool - if you're creative, the uses are endless!	13
Can see the same welding issues as the other users, though I'm not sure if it would affect the maximum load (2 tons) the jack stands can hold. Sturdy jack stands, might be slightly high for some cars, depending on what you are trying to do (being too high isn't awful - you just need to jack your car up a little more).Overall, simple no frills car jack stands. Has a safety pin mechanism to to keep the jack stand locked, as well as the regular locking handle.	2
Backgammon is all about doubling and probable rolls of the dice...This is fast and great play.  A well designed app on my KFire. Trying to figure the algorithm for the computer to accept or decline the double has made solo play funner....I want a job at the AI Factory... $90k@300k valuation with 250k line of credit@6% paid when net positive revenue.  And the whole game is under 4mb...another plus for the IPO.  Who would-of Thunk- you'd make your momma so proud?  Bravo... Lawson di Ransom Canyon.  9-2013	1
Starcraft: Brood War is twice as better than the origonal! Zerg Lurkers can tear up anything, while Devoureres devistate the air! The new dark Archon, that comes from the Dark Templar is sweet, and I love taking over the oppenents units. The Corsiar is fast and terrifying. The medic become prime targets, because they stop their units from dying, and the units keep killing mine. The graphics are sweet. The sound is awsome. The unit pathfinding isn't that good, like most games, but it's better than what it was. All in all, bargian at any price, and it deserves 10 stars. Buy it!	23
I was hoping for larger dumplings, I admit, but this was an ok substitute. While not particularly delicious, I didn't find anything wrong with it.I'm torn between giving this a three and a four... to me, a four is something I'll order again because it's a little bit better than average, while a three is just average, and not something I'd really want to buy again. Since this is unremarkable, I'm going with a three, but if you particularly love soup or something, it is not a bad product. Just not noteworthy.	11
This makes lining up cabinets a breeze.  I loaned them out several times already and everyone says the same thing - it makes hanging cabinets, especially uppers, much easier.  I remodeled my kitchen and these allowed me to both pull the cabinets together tightly as well as flush at the face.  After getting them flush/tight, you drill a pilot then pop in a screw and you are good to go (mount to wall of course).Great tool for the money, for a DIY'er or pro.  You could get away without using it, but why would you want to.	21
I loved this story about Joseph. It's one of my favourite stories in the Old Testament. I felt the actors brought this very important story to life in a manner that was refreshing and interesting. The direction was very good, the costumes inhanced the film, and acting was top notch. I almost forgot that this was a made for TV film. If you're looking for someway to present this story this is a very good way. It's close to Scripture without being confusing and perfect for those who are beginners and delightful for those who aren't.	15
We don't have TV or Video game in our home.  So we bought this for my 4yrs old daugther who is excellent with puzzles, slide puzzles and games. I was a bit worried that it might be too hard for her but we have older kids too so we chose this instead of rush hour Jr. My daughter loves it and it is really fun. She and her siblings(7, 8yrs) do this at home, in the car. I love little travel pouch so all these little pieces can go in there.I love think fun product.	22
I have seen this book on the shelves for sometime now and only just got around to reading it. It was so enjoyable that I read it in a day, I just couldn't put it down. The main character, Jacob, is intriguing without being over complicated. It is a peek into the history of the circus, all the while swirling a great mystery and love affair that will keep you glued to this page turner. I would recommend this book to anyone who enjoys historical fiction, mysteries, and a truly good read.	5
I bought this at a local store for just 3 dollars,and I wanted to know what the hype was about.Typically, I use more expensive products on my face,believing that they will do the trick, but I was proven wrong.Despite the low price of this, it works very well, and there is agenerous amount of it in the package. I recommend it, it stingsa bit, but really does what it says! I do also feel a bit of tightnessfrom it, but other than that, this is a great product and has a priceyou really can't beat.	4
Having what was considered the best Godzilla suit of the Showa series, it also had one of the best stories and monster battles done in the 60's.  Here was the first real time Godzilla was hinted at as being an unstopable force of nature that man just was not destined to stop, let alone kill. This film also is the lead-up to the next movie of the series - Gehdorah. Get both as they are both a great buy as well a great films.  Love the Mastwork packaging, wish they all were.	15
I had this game recommend to me and purchased it hoping that I would enjoy it.  I must say that it is an excellent game.  It is a little like Apples to Apples, but with pictures instead of words.  You can be endlessly creative with this game.  It is great for a variety of ages and can be easily enjoyed.  It is really fast to learn, but can take a way to understand all of the subtle strategy to the game.  I would definitely recommend it to other people.  Great game for all ages!	22
Ticket to Ride is a game my family and I have been able to play over and over and over again.  It's one of the best new games I've played in years.  I have the game, expansions and even the iPad version.  The classic physical board game is still my favorite with friends, but the digital version allows you to play against an AI pretty easily with no change in gameplay.If you know a computer scientist, math major or engineer, they will find the mathematical puzzle of solving the &#34;Shortest Path&#34; problem fascinating.A great gift for a friend or your family.	22
raved about it!  It looked like a good game for the family, so I got it for a Christmas present.  I think the kids have gotten to play it once or twice, but the adults in the family invite friends over for game night and this is the game of choice.It's been fun watching my niece and husband invite her brother and fiance over to play this game.  They went out and bought one of the other &#34;Ticket to Ride&#34; games as well.It's a keeper and definitely worth the money.  A GREAT break from TV!	22
This may be great for some people but the information listed neglects to tell you that this is a flat barrel 1/2 inch iron which is suppose to give ribbon like curls. Although the package says ribbon curl I didnt realize the barrel was going to be flat and I was a little disappointed when I got it. That's the only downside, everything else like the settings, heat, and tangle free cord all work great and shipping was fast. So if your into ribbon looking curls then this iron would be for you otherwise keep looking.	4
In season two they maintain standards -- lovely period, good ensemble, with soapy story lines. But there is a weariness to it all. I think if it had gone to a third season it would have crumbled like a dry rotted piece of lace. Not a lot of laughs. Sometimes a little too much nobility and starchy knickers but you are drawn into the lives of the characters based on real archival material of the period. Nice glimpse of an interesting period in history. All in all, it makes for satisfying television.	0
HBO and the BBC have really outdone themselves with this first season. A brilliant action-packed and highly  emotionally charged violent series doesn't just tell the story of the rise to power and death of Caesar, but portrays the most violent ancient Roman world, where we of today forget just how cheap life was back then. You see for yourself through the eyes of two centurions, who get wrapped up in the intrigue and as mere pawns tragically manipulated and toyed with by all levels of society.Joe Wocoski, Author	0
This is a cute show with cute characters. The premise of the show is always the same...there is a problem for an animal (somewhere in the world) and the three Wonder Pets (after donning their super hero capes and hats) leave the school classroom where they live to save the animal in distress. The colors are vibrant, the graphics are nicely done, and there is always a happy ending! This show has been a big hit with my grand child since she was two years old and I would recommend it!	0
Years, and years ago my Daddy who was a fantastic gardener gave me a fantastic salad spinner, but after many, many spins it gave out.  I bought at least three spinners after that--all went to the dump.  Cook's Ilustrated Test Kitchen recommended the Oxo Salad Spinner and I love Cook's for their testing--they really are the Consumer Reports of the cooking world--and it lived up to their ratings.  I expect to have this spinner working for me the rest of my life.	13
I keep buying these books. The last one(sweeter than wine) was a vast improvement. There was a story line! There was character development!! Finally one of the books has some meat!!! I was excited for the next installment! Then I read it.......and it fell flatter than a fifth graders training bra. Especially when I finished it in about 45 min. And we skip about 2 years. And we go from I love you, to vows, to babies, to a year later...in about 20 pages....c'mon bianca, youre better than this.	14
Ape Escape is an awesome game with amazing graphics and great storyline. The game has over 200 different monkeys, each with hilarious attitudes. This was (no doubt) my favorite game of all time, cuz I just love playing adventure/platform games. This game is not easy to beat if you want to complete it 100%. There are time trials for almost every level and cool mini-games. It took me over a month to beat the game 100%, but I'm just an average gamer. I recommend this game, cuz it's fun, exciting, cool, and CHEAP $$$!	23
This is the best knife I ever had.I wasn't certain spending so much on a pocket knife would be worth it but it was.It is solid and large. It flicks open easily and locks up firmly.  The blade stays sharp.  It continues to work like and look like new.  You can easily operate it with one hand while you hold what you are cutting in the other.The sharpened tip proves very useful for opening packages.  The serrated part of the blade is good for cutting plastic ties.	20
"I got this book for my Kindle free; after reading I'm really glad I didn't pay anything for it. The storyline had the potential for a good ""Twilight Zone"" kind of story, but was just too lightweight to make it. The author seems to feel the need to put in really XX rated sex scenes - she seemed to love to be able to use the word c**k. I didn't find this adding anything to the story, and only finished it because it's a fairly short book."	14
"Remix albums are most of the time not done too well (see Rob Zombie's ""American Made Music to Strip By""), but this is the only case I have come across where a remix album is quite good.  The songs from ""Astro Creep 2000"" are remixed pretty good, adding a techno vibe to the songs, plus there is a cover of ""I'm Your Boogieman"" which is also on ""The Crow: City of Angels"" soundtrack.  Sadly though, this was White Zombie's last official recording before their untimely breakup."	9
"What a great game, I like it alot. The only problems I found were:1: It gives off way too many hints to how to complete a puzzle or beat a boss(EXAMPLE: On the first time you fight Bowser, he says ""Can you get behind me and grab my tail? I think not!""2: Moving around is kinda stupid because Mario can't move to the different direction fast enough and he slips on the floor when he moves.Other than these flaws, this is a solid title that deserves to be in your collection."	23
'Sign O' The Times' is the most accomplished album Price evermade and he's made some classics.And this extremely well filmedconcert movie strings togther pure live footage and performancesexcerpted for his MTV videos of the period.The live version of&quot;Forever In  My Life&quot; (one of my top ten favorite Prince songs)kicks the PANTS off the album version.But Prince-what is thebuisness about squirrel meat?And IS life nothin' but a muffin?Sometimes this guys conversation baffles me but you just can'tfault his sublime musical taste.He's a bit Chuck Berry,Hendrix,Santana and even Liberace (in dress sometimes,anyway) all rolledinto one unique musical ball.A sheer delight all through!	6
This game is fun for the exact opposite reason that Metal Gear Solid is fun.  In this game stealth isn't of much importance, while quickly killing all the bad guys on the screen is important.  Like most action games this one is staged out into many different missions, which usually have five or six objectives in order throughout the level. My personal favorite aspect of this game is the target system which locks on to the enemy of your choice making the game easier in a crowded room of enemies.  Syphon Filter is one great pure action game.	23
At first I did believe it, then I was like, ''Nah, it can't be true'' But boy wasI wrong!! The next day I got on the app. I still wasn't sure if it was real. I was just sitting on my bed, using the app ans still doubting it. But then a dot came up and the words spoken was COME  !! It SCARED me. I am freaked out right now!!!!!!!!! I totally believe	1
These bottles are useful for storing milk....they are sturdy and fit in bottle warmers nicely.  My baby hates them for feeding, however.  I now just use these for storage and then pour the warmed milk into Playtex Nurser bottles.  I bought the Medela system when I was pregnant b/c I wanted what was best for my baby...and I was led to believe that Medela nipples would be most like the breast.  Um, no.  Take one look at them and it's pretty clear.  My baby wouldn't even take it in her mouth.  She instantly responded to the Playtex nipples, however.  Much, much better!	3
I use labels a lot...for postage and for labeling items around the house and in the garage.  These are really easy to use (ALL the avery labels are!), but what I really love about these is that I don't have to peel off the old shipping label if I'm re-using a box or envelope.  These will cover the old label so all that shows is the new information.  BIG time-saver, not to mention the savings that come from re-using boxes and envelopes!	17
A few months ago I ordered and received a different chain but after giving a good review, it broke.  It was really my inexperience because I ordered a much thinner one.  My son needed a chain for a medal he wears and when the first one broke after many years I ordered one that was just to fine for his medal.  This one seems to be much stronger and I believe it will last for a long time.  He is very pleased with it and it is of very good quality.	8
Quick rinse and eat like ramen.  I personally cooked it up for 10 mins in flavored broth, added my veggies and meats and it is exactly like ramen.  The only difference is, you don't digest it, it just comes out looking exactly the same as it looked coming in meaning, no digestion! Chaching!  Weight loss! The other brands are more rubbery, this one really has the exact texture of ramen, just don't let other bad reviews mess with your head, it's really not bad at all.	11
I found this product through the Amazon subscribe and save program. It is now the only razor that my husband will use. His skin is very sensitive, so most razors cause nicks, cuts, scrapes and rashes. He has none of these problems using this razor. On occasion he will nick himself, but that is usually because he's in a hurry! I will continue to buy this razor for as long as Amazon has it at such a good price. They are much more expensive at my local stores.	12
Without this saw, there are many, many projects we would have not been able to finish correctly. It's a must-have for any remodeler or carpenter.Edited to add later: I have been in the process of building a home and have gone through two of these saws. This saw is great for doing small, sharp cuts in trim or stair work, hard to reach places or intricate cuts that you simply cannot do with a jigsaw or any other power tool. Don't keep looking, just buy this saw and get working.	21
Wall hangers are good space-saving ideas, but I'm one of those who thinks they can stress necks, depending on the body/neck weight distribution and balance. I made my own hanging bases - just a carved slab of wood, really - to support the instrument from the bottom. The top hanger now just serves as a rest, but depending on the guitar's balance I'd recommend a heavy rubber band or something to stretch across the prongs if there's any tendency for the guitar to tilt forward.	16
But if you want thrilling early Verdi with all his flaws and with all his genius stop right here. I wonder if you could cast this opera today. Certainly not as well as this 1984 La Scala production. It is good to see Carreras, the 3rd tenor, at work. And Dhimitrova is at her straight out best. The production also deserves a word of praise. A full traditional production with real grandeur. The sound is a little thumpy but that's its age. All in all a welcome addition to the galley years of the Verdi canon.	6
Ok, my 3 yr. old shouldn't be drinking out of a bottle anymore BUT, I have really put these bottles to good use! I have a 1 1/2 yr. old and 3 yr. old still drinking out of these....they have a few quirks but you deal with them and get used to it and LOVE, LOVE , LOVE the ease of use! I do,however, wash the liners sometimes to re-use or I'd be in bankruptcy...Publix and Walmart and other stores have liners you can use when the Playtex gets to be too expensive!	3
The Phantom Menace takes you on a journey through the great moments of the film. It features very sharp looking graphics with a third person view (a la Tomb Raider.) There are many puzzles within the actions scenes. Each of the levels are pretty long and will take time for you to complete. The hardest of which is when you first meet &quot;the mysterious little boy.&quot; There isn't much to say bad about the game except that it could have benefited from being first person rather than 3rd. Some of the camera angles are weird. Other than that, this is a very solid effort.	23
Season 6 is OK but the novelty is wearing off.  Jack is superhuman, of course.  Supporting characters Morris & Cloe are interesting. The rest are basic carryovers.  We will see if the new (12 hour) 'Live another day' comes up with something new.  I have been working my way through from season one over the last few months.  Could be better with long breaks between seasons so you get ready for a fresh Jack Attack fix?  That's how I see it.  Have fun watching!	0
My  out door  Cat  Free loader  loves this  snuggle  safe heating  Pad.  It  keeps  her  warm  for  hours.I  put  it  in  her  out door  cat  Igloo.  I  think  it  works  better than  a  pug in  out  door  heating pad.  She  just  came  to  my  door  one  day and  must  have  said this  lady  is  going  to  take good  care  of  me.And  I  do.	19
I happen to live near the ocean,, so I have the luxury of testing it against a control system.  I took several samples of ocean water at various depths and away from shore to see what the actualy salinity was.  Then I made a mark on it to set the salinity of my fish tank.. (.038) anyway,,  I live in the south pacific in the marshall islands..  It seems a little high,, so either the gauge is slightly wrong or the water has more salt than what wikipedia says it should be for the tropics.	19
I enjoyed this book so much!  Loved the main hero Hannibal Jones!  What an Alpha Male Hero!  I was so busy turning the pages that my poor husband had to do all the chores!  The suspense never let's up!  The action is well planned!  It is a taut, fast pace action thriller with just enough of romance interweaved!  I loved the fact that that the author, Mr Camacho, made Hannibal a very human hero, who wins a few and loses a few!  For fans of Action Thrillers this is a book well worth reading!  I am definitely a FAN!	14
I have researched every gate on the market at this point.  So far we are extremely happy with this gate.  We wanted pressure mounted gates but I was concerned that the opening of this particular gate would not be wide enough for my husband.  I thought that he would have to turn sideways to get through the door and would not like it once used on a regular basis.  So far we are very satisfied customers and my husband can walk straight through the opening so the width meets our needs better than I anticipated.	3
If you're curious about your Wi-Fi connections (and those of your immediate neighbors), this little app is fun to play with.  There are five different graphs/readings included that indicate the strength (or lack thereof) of your signal.  It can also be used on the road when you're looking for the strongest Wi-Fi signal to use.  There are also a number of settings included if you want to tweak your Kindle further.  All in all, quite practical and not too technical.	1
This product was lightweight and easy to use. Even a person with back problems will be able to use this product with ease and minimal strain to back. It was easy to assemble and I had no problems with using this trimmer.This product was good for trimming; however, it did not work well for cutting thicker grass and weeds. I found it fairly easy to change the spool wire on this product.  I recommend buying the trimmer bundle that comes with extra wire and spool.Over all, this was a good product and served its purpose and the price was right. My husband loved it.	18
Crash Bandicoot is one of my oldest games on my oldest system, the Playstation. Still, I have never grown tired of playing levels, which used to be challenges that now I pass with a breeze. The levels are awe inspiring. Water is flowing without a crack, the jungle is incredibly lush, and the characters have no mistakes from their hair to their sneakers. Story is interesting too-you have to save Crash's girlfriend Tawna from Dr. Neo Cortex. The only disadvantage is the limited controls-jump and spin. This game brought two sequels and two other games that involve racing and mini games. No wonder.	23
"I was very suprised about this book. I couldn't put it down! I was soo into the characters. I was really pulling for them. Then as the Dream Machine put her dreams on ""film"" for them to view it had me so interested. How cool would that be for your man to ""know"" what to do to make your fantasies come true without you having to voice them. We don't always want to say what our fantasies are. It was very hot! I really Love Jane Rylon's stories!"	14
It's impossible listen to Pink Moon without tears in the eyes. Drake's would be dead months later and music would be in the listeners minds forever. But the sound made by that 25 years-old englishman with his words  and single guitar remains stronger than poetry, than VW commercials (that I  didn't and I won't see here in Brazil), than all the simple things. This  disc is a statement of life and how big it can be, Drake is saying death is  possible. And only someone who knew the life can say it.	9
This is good stuff, smells strongly of Peppermint, even when diluted. If you are good with that you will love this stuff for cleaning your body, countertops, etc. Be advised that if using this to clean your body a little bit goes a long way. If you are at all sensitive you may want to use the Baby mild or perhaps the Almond formula as this soap leaves your skin literally tingling. I feel cleaner and more refreshed when using this soap on my body than any bar soap I have ever used. Good stuff.	20
"I bought a tusq nut and this tusq saddle for an Aria acoustic which can be a nice sounding guitar. The difference is quite noticeable and good. The guitar is a modest model but it is a player with a ""better than a lot more expensive guitars"" sound. I had a bone nut that cracked which is why I tried these replacements. In my estimation the sound is clearer, brighter and louder. The price seemed high for a little chunk of ""plastic"" but the difference in sound leaves me satisfied."	16
I've tried to like this pedal, I really have.  Maybe it's my signal chain (?)  My experience with the DigiTech series is that they suck the tone out from your guitar.  Sure, the OD is there, but it isn't worth losing your tone, is it?  Again, I reiterate maybe it's just me.  I have been messing around with signal chains for almost 3 decades now.  And the blue pedal isn't any different, either IMO.  Grunge was OK, but not my kind of style.	16
bought h500 and was defective, motorola replaced extremely quickly, must of been out out h5oo cause they sent me the h710.  Was very easy to set up with my t-mobile dash.  lasts forever, good sound - lack of ear plug a big plus.when washed this one by accident replaced with h721 cause only version i could find local, would have replaced with h710 if i could have found it.uses micro usb charger and not mini like the dash but you can get adaptor so u can  charge with same charger.	7
These fertilizer tabs are the ones that I found recommended the most on tropical fish/plants message boards.  So they were one of the first things I bought when I planted my tank.  I've found my plants stay nice and green (after adjusting to my tank) and don't seem to lack for any nutrients, and this is the only fertilizer I use.  I'm more than satisfied with them.  You only have to replace them once every 4 months, so its not as expensive as a lot of other fertilizers, and they apparently do the job!.	19
Homeworld deserves EVERY bit of the game of the year accolade.I have never seen such a breathtaking and stunning game/piece of entertainment before, and I seriously doubt something like this will surface again the  next few decades.Is Homeworld the best game ever made? That is a tough  decission, but it sure comes pretty damn close!Anyway the  game/experience should be a must-have for anybody interested in a  completely controlable 3D universe, science fiction, tactics, space,  simulations, strategy and an extraordinary experience.	23
The good:  The rubber handle is more comfortable to grip and ergonomic, and the metal tines are sturdy and clean up easily.  It's also light.  I have some other Kuhn Rikon whisks that are fancy and much more expensive.  They're nice, but I keep reaching for the OXO.The bad:  It doesn't stay upright in the pan when you put it down.  It keeps sliding into the pan, so you need to set it aside on a plate or trivet when cooking.Overall, my favorite whisk.	13
This game was my first RPG back in the day. I absolutely loved it. I really would love to play it again, and I'm sure this game is overhyped for many that didn't play it back in the day. This game had charm, great CG cutscenes, and it totally captured me in the last few hours. Some say it wouldn't hold up by today's standards, and maybe not. But I would love to play it again someday (maybe on PSN) and would love even more a remake done in HD.I've been an RPG fan ever since.	23
I haven't been a big fan of Prada's fragrances over the years but absolutely fell in love with the sweetness and candy-like scent of this perfume! This smells like a sweet, decadent caramel with tones of vanilla and I'm not sure what else, but it smells great! Although, I must say that this seller is asking for WAY too high a price for this bottle! You could get the 2.7 oz bottle for around the same price at Neiman Marcus (the 1.7 oz for around $80 if you prefer a smaller bottle)!	4
I wanted to find a Christmas gift for my son that wasn't just another action figure and something that was educational. He is naturally curious and this was right up his alley. When he did the first task (a buzzer) and it worked, you should have seen his eyes light up. It gave him a great deal of confidence. I like that some are easy for him to figure out so that he doesn't get frustrated, but also that some are more difficult and challenge him to think or recheck his connections if it doesn't work.	22
The Colloidal Oatmeal in the Aveeno Products is the reason I keep buying them, even if I'm not overly excited about smoothing petrolatum over my skin.I wish these products were all natural. I have noticed the oatmeal has a calming effect on my skin and the addition of Lavender, Chamomile and Ylang-Ylang is emotionally healing.The minute you put this cream on your skin, you can feel the difference. Your skin becomes calm, soothed and smooth and silky. Perfect for after a shower or during the day when you need a calming moment.~The Rebecca Review	4
I've been eating Frosted Flakes for as long as I can remember. One of those simple treats that never gets old. Although, as age has not stood still for me, I tend to mix this with a more age-appropriate cereal such as bran flakes. A good-sized touch of Tony the Tiger makes the good-for-you cereal much easier to deal with.The box is huge, but inside there are two sealed bags of a more normal size that will fit in the cabinet. Very fresh, and if you catch it on a price dip, it's better priced than the warehouse clubs.Love those flakes!	11
The best squirrel proof feeder out!  We purchase our first one in 2007 and recently the perches came loose and we lost them - a simple call and email to the company brought us a new set in just a few days.  Great support!  Feeder is easy to load and easy to use and works great.  When we lost the perches we purchased a new one and then got the parts for the old one - now we use two and they are wonderful - expensive but well built, last a long time and company stands behind them.  Worth every penny!	18
This case cover is very thin and I imagine would only protect from scratches and the smallest of bumps. It fit my Nexus quite well, to the point it was causing me some trouble to get it over the edges of my screen cover. But once done I am happy with it. There is no excessive movement, the buttons work easily still and the cut out for the speaker and plug ins work perfectly. It also gives some extra grip to the rather slick Nexus, making one hand operation and reading safer and easier.	7
"But... then I found chocolate peanut butter Newman-O's and everything was right with the world again... in terms of cookie satisfaction, that is.I prefer to pull two of them apart, eating the two naked cookie halves - then smash the two halves w/peanut butter together to make a ""double stuff"" Newman-O.  In my humble opinion there is no finer store-bought cookie enjoyment experience available on Earth at the current time.This is what you wave under my nose to make sure I'm REALLY dead."	11
Both a great tasting pancake syrup and highly effective laxative! It must be the mallitol but every time I have this I have to go. If you like pancakes and farting this is the stuff you want. I didn't get cramps or pain, just gas and lots of poop. If you want less farts and less pooping then mix it with Vermont Sugar Free syrup which is made with splenda. I do 2 parts Vermont sugar free maple syrup to one part of this and it tastes even better. Vermonts is not that good by itself so it fixes that problem too.	11
I should have known better than to purchase a dish soap that had a high fragrance, I thought this would be a nice change and allow me to actually enjoy washing dishes (no dishwasher) yes it smells great but leaves a bad residue, which you can taste on everything!! It's especially bad with plastic, it soaks up this soap like no other and even when you rinse it a million times, you can still taste it. Awful!! And yeah they're not green, this stuff gots chemicals too, just look it up on ewg.org.	4
Followed the simple instructions for application and applied this to my fruit bearing bushes, herb garden, vegetable garden, and flower beds. My problem is rabbits and an occassional deer. So far, i have not spotted any offenders in the treated areas.Since I only applied this a few days ago, i cannot attest to its effectiveness over a three month period. However, I am pleased with its performance and ease of application. It is doing a good job when it comes to keeping my growing rabbit population at bay.	18
The dreamcast was without a doubt a great console. But, like all great things (such as the nintendo 64) It died out. I really think that they should have made a lot more games for it, but i was already satisfied with the games that were out. Any body who likes resident evil would have to agree that Resident Evil 2 and Code veronica were great games. Powerstone was pretty fun to, along with Sonic's Adventure. I would recommend this system to anyone that doesn't mind  playing older games.	23
I don't have multitudes of pH testers around to attest to the accuracy, but it never gives me readings that seem off. It's easy and fast. I'm so used to my ammonia tester (that I use more often) that requires 5 minutes of waiting, it's nice to just put the water in, put the drops in, shake, and see what the water's at. This hasn't changed my life or anything, but it's everything that I wanted in a pH test kit.	19
I simply find the game ordinary and boring. I really love the TV-show and was very much looking forward to the game.Man I was  dissapointed!There is nothing new in the game. It is simply an ordinary  shoot 'em up including the characters from South Park.Admitted: There  are a few funny features in the game, the cow-shooting gun, Mr. Hanky the  christmas Poo but even these things gets quite boring after a very short  while.My advise is: Enjoy the TV-show and use your playstation for  something else.	23
perfect fit right out of box... I read all reviews and, asked people whom wore Keen sandals; all said order 1/2 size larger. Great advise! Do as suggested. Wore all day, without any rubs or discomfort.I had have tried both New Balance & Merrill barefoot shoes to use while sailing. When the deck got wet from heeling and, spray I lost footing. Ended up on floor, real close to capsizing. Not again. I like the feel Keen sandals so much I now own 2 pair.A shoe to try that's not a sandal, Northface! Nice, too.	8
This film captures one of rock's most creative bands at their absolute creative peak. They were still wildly experimental, just on the cusp of mega-stardom. The film captures the Floyd just before Roger Waters began  dominating the group and terrorizing the shyer members of the band, such as  Rick Wright. The film is a perfect visual representation of the Floyd in  this period--conceptual, strange, trippy though tasteful. Their interviews  in the film are priceless, especially Nick Mason's bitter struggle to get a  slice of pie without the crust. The film demands multiple viewings.	6
"A Christmas gift for a 5-year-old, so at this time I am not qualified to speak of it's durability.  However, I do know it is a great game and it arrived from Amazon quickly and in perfect shape. Update--in playing this game, we have found it to be quite difficult for young children to ""pop"" the dice bubble.  Their hands just are not strong enough to do the job, which is somewhat disappointing to them. I am still very happy to have purchased it."	22
I enjoy this game very much. I find it relaxing to play and I even enjoy the music. It is one of the few games I play with the sound on. I play every level until I get a perfect score on them all - and then reset the scores and start over. I really don't understand the bad reviews. Must be a matter of taste. I don't much care for high stress games but I don't mind thinking. Play in on Kindle Fire so the SD card thing is not an issue.	1
This well built, well engineered squirting palm brush replaced a nasty, leaky sponge-type soap dispenser and a soap pump bottle that took about 50 pumps to get a dab of soap.  The nylon bristles can be cleaned easily after each use, so it doesn't get disgusting.  The dispenser valve doesn't leak, so you can fill it up with soap and set it on the sink rim or counter, then when you need some soap for washing dishes, a couple of squirts is all you need since the squirt volume is very adequate.  My wife also loves it!	13
It is a very simple yet effective test when someone needs to know the ph of soil (outside for the most part).The ONLY CON i have with this test is the pill capsules filled with the reactive powder which in the end is the catalyst for the color. You do need ph'd water or a very distilled water to test your soil with. If you use tap, you are taking the chance of an off reading due to the ph of your tap water. For the price and complexity it is well worth it. Not a perfect 5 stars but 4 is an understatement.	18
"Fit my 29 gallon (30"" Long, 12"" Wide, 18"" High) just right. The two glass pieces came already inserted into the plastic piece that allows the glass to be lifted for feeding. The other extra plastic piece goes onto the rear glass piece in case you have filters in the back and need to cut slots out for them. However, i don't use that plastic piece, and have a inch and a half space that fits well for my filter and heater. It also comes with an attachable handle that makes it easier to lift the glass."	19
it's ok if you need to find something nearby but the listings are incomplete.  I was expecting it to have more complete listings than it does.  If I need to find a bank or a fast food place when I'm someplace away from home, it comes in handy.  But when I'm trying to find a business that I know is in the area, I often don't.  I'll find some of the same type of business but not always the one I'm looking for.  It would be much better if it were more complete.	1
My four-year old son just asked if he could watch this for the 3rd time in a row this evening. The little story line (Ernie is learning the routine in the Furry Arms, the local hotel) is entertaining for little kids-- as are the characters. Some are over-the-top, but with little kids, they *have* to be so the kids recognizee they're obnoxious.For kids who avoid counting, this is a good way to sneak it in. They don't realize it's &quot;good for them&quot;!	15
I don't know what it is about the Galileo, but my American Bulldogs looooove it. They will actually fight over it. I don't know whether its the shape or flavor or what. I usually get them Nylabones dura chews (as they are strong chewers) and this holds up about as well (though it is hard to gauge as they really chew this one so much more). The biggest size is much larger than the second largest size, so despite the big price jump I still think its worth it.	19
I read the rave reviews about using it for years through many generations and the benefits of using it. I am in my early 50's so I wanted to get rid of forehead wrinkles and facial lines. I think I got better results in Ponds. This rich cream may need to sit on the face at night but I don't do night creams-messy. It seems it blends in nicely with a little moderate rubbing but I just didn't notice much difference in my apperance. It's just ok with me not bad and not great.	4
Just bought the game and played it for the first time yesterday with 4 players.  Good game to get the wives involved that that isn't too in depth in terms of multiple levels of strategy that scare away casual players.  The destination tickets add the variety to keep it fresh each time so that it's not always a race to get the 6 space routes.  The lack of dice help to keep chance (luck) to a minimum other than the rail cards that you draw.  Highly recommended.	22
Californication is a very fun, wild, and inventive show. In someways it feels like a highbrow entourage minus the literal entourage. The main character, Hank Moody, is a wild bad boy writer whose fun times usually lead him into some sticky situations. There is a solid balance between love, laughter, and over the top situations. At several times you will find yourself wanting to be in Hank's shoes and other times so glad you live a relatively benign life. A very fun watch and i would recommend it to anyone that does not mind excessive profanity and at times nudity.	0
Sid Meier's is kind of a one-act-show when it comes to games, basically most of what I've seen from him has been turn-based strategy games with single-unit armies, such as Civilzation and this game, but I must admit, he's good at what he does, and I don't blame him for not leaving his comfort zone.  Alpha Centauri is pretty much Civilization with an alien, futuristic twist.  Definitely appeals to the game types that I like, and this game does not disappoint.  It's always fun to see if I can beat my former accomplishments in this game and it never gets old.	23
I looked at this tool in a local store because I'm installing crown in an older house. It is very well made and deserves more than one star, but while I was in the store I found a simple plastic tool for measuring angles called &quot;mite-r-gage&quot;. It gives you an accurage measurement which you then compare with a crown table that gives you the angle and bevel for flat cuts on a compound miter saw.I just wanted people to consider this $10 alternative if the Bosch is overkill for how often you'll use it.	21
Very disappointing to learn that this show enjoyed only 1 season.  Does not speak well for the American viewing public if they were not willing to make the effort to follow a somewhat complicated story-line that ultimately reveals itself &#34;in toto&#34; with each progressive episode.  The character of Sean Walker was expertly cast, as was Sophia, Pres. Martinez, Agent Lee, Nat'l Security Dir. Sterling, Michael Buchanan, etc...  The transporting of the entire planet during the last episode was ingenious & unexpected.	0
"It's amazing what a difference quality tools will make in the kitchen. My old strainers did the job. They... well, strained. But they were getting rusty and they just felt cheap. These strainers simply feel great. The handle has a good grip to it, the mesh will have you rubbing it a little when nobody's looking, and it just looks classy. The 8"" size is the perfect general-use size. The price is a little steep for what I'd normally want to pay for a simple tool, but it was worth it."	13
"Good fit, although I took others suggestions about the length and they were dead on. If you typically wear a 32 in the length get a 30"" and you'll be good. I found the waist to be true to size. The pants are comfortable, maybe a touch lightweight for the winter but I get cold easier than most. Otherwise very comfortable, they have pleanty of room in legs and the rise is roomy. All in all they look nice and I love the cargo pockets. I would reccomend these to anyone"	8
Very light and easy to store. Fan noise is very noticable but it stays in the garage so who cares.  I love the LED readout for % charged and volts when plugged in and attached to battery.  Very pleased the the charger but for those of you who like the feel of a heavy metal constructed unit that can take a beating this is not your cup of tea.  All plastic and the buttons seem equally flimsey but so far they work well. Time and use will tell how long they will hold up.	2
I was lucky enough to pick this toy up for $2 at a garage sale.  My 4 1/2 yr old toted it around for days.....  now almost a year later he still loves to pull it out of the toy box.  Even better the 1 yr old is also enthralled.It is totally durable, nicely portable and the entertainment does not seem to grow old.Only down side is that it often gets accidently turned on while rummaging around in the toy box. And thus can run out of batteries if it stays on unnoticed.	22
Timex Kids' Color Indiglo Hearts Stretch Band Watch #T7B111 - I have been wearing these kids' watches during the summer for several years. They are inexpensive and have cloth straps, so when the straps wear out, I feel no regret about tossing them and buying replacements. I got several in different colors to coordinate with my wardrobe. When the weather cools off, I put them away until next summer. They've been very reliable and easy and cheap to get the batteries repaired, including at Wal-Mart.	8
This product was recommended by many of my resources for adding gelatin into my diet. I tried using it in homemade gummies, but EEK, was that a strong, greasy, odd taste! I will not give up on it, but I think I'm going to use WAY LESS of this product to begin with until I get used to the texture of it, then I can begin to increase it. It wasn't as bad in homemade chicken soup or beef stew, though. So, I recommend going easy on it first until you get used to it.	11
I have used Frontline on my dog for years, but this is the first time that I purchase Frontline Plus.  I cannot be certain that our problem is a direct result of the Frontline Plus, but my dog developed a growth and open wound at the place where this is applied.  I have contacted the company and they were very kind and made a report for their research.  However, the dog required medical attention and antibiotics.  Just wanted people to be aware to keep an eye on the application site just in case it was a direct result of this product.	19
My dogs skin has improved a lot since I switched her to this food. I'm dissappointed in the amount of grains used in it and tomato pomace. Protien amounts are great. For only a few dollars more I can get a grain free salmon dog food made in the usa not by one of these huge dog food companies that tend to have recalls all the time. If your on a strict budget this is a great food for dogs, but I want better for mine so I'm switching to Taste of the Wild dog food.	19
The heavy, stiff paper used for these is very smooth and bright white for crisp, clear, text and high res. photos, and logos, and other graphic arts.  These are some of the best quality inkjet printable perforated business cards I have ever felt.  Usually they're much less stiff and crisp.  These are very nearly top professional business card quality.And the new feature of smooth edges is very nice also.  Most perforated business cards have obvious perf edges.  These have good edges.  Yay.	17
This latest version of Larks Tongues is so close to the 30th anniversary version in how it sounds that I almost have to say I don't hear a difference. I know, all of you Crimson folks out their are just a rabid as all of you Gentle Giant fans reading this. If it's a new version you MUST have it. NO Choice. Well I can say that I did notice a huge difference when I listened to the 5.1. That is where this release really shines. Get it for that and the videos. You have NO choice!	6
"When these first were released on VHS in the 80's, they alone almost cost $19, now you get 3 titles in one DVD!There is no 5.1 mix but it is 2.0 stereo.Manzerik made a few Doors videos in the ""Dance on Fire"" title, ""LA Woman"" is a nice piece of art.The collection shows many live performances and video clips, as well as interviews.The 3 films Combined you gives hours of enjoyment.  Until the remaining 3 members sit down for new interviews and create thier own Beatle-like verison of ""Anthology"", this DVD set is very acceptable."	6
We have a standard size and shape toilet seat. Yet, this potty seat fits the seat in an awkward manner, causing pee to leak both on top and under the front of the toilet seat. Granted, I have little boys, so maybe this isn't so much of a problem with girls.We had MUCH better luck with the Mommy's Helper Cushie Tushie potty seat (the one with the ducks on it), which is, incidentally, much cheaper and easier to clean. The same unfortunate pee situation never happens with that seat.	3
These soft licorice bites from Panda are not as soft as the &#34;soft-eating licorice&#34; from Down Under but are what I would describe as soft but chewy. They are truly &#34;all natural&#34; and have a minimum of ingredients&#8211;&#8211;molasses, wheat flour, licorice extract, and natural flavor (aniseed oil). Nothing more than that. They have a slightly grainy texture, which comes from the use of wheat flour. They also have a strong, traditional licorice taste, which make them ideal for a person with a craving for genuine licorice.	11
I got these out of curiosity- I like Meiji brand chocolates but had only really had the mushroom-  and bamboo-shaped ones. The box is pretty small (and rather banged up, but it didn't affect the contents.) Its quite difficult not to eat the whole thing in one sitting. The chocolate has a sweet dark chocolate flavor, but not overly sweet. The strawberry flavor is more of a hint, but strong enough to still know its there. Overall it was a nice balanced flavor. I would get them again! I wish they were easier to come by locally.	11
This did not work at all on my 2 small dogs.  After I installed it right near their favorite window to bark at they stopped barking until it stopped making the noise but after repeating this a couple times they became immune to the noise and ignore it completely.  Besides not working the other thing I did not like about this was the power cord.  My fault for not reading the description close enough but I figured a product like this would probably be battery operated but it only runs using a power cord to an electrical outlet.	19
I've seen and used many different types of capos over the years and they range from the very cumbersome and difficult to use to the easily breakable but I've never used one as convenient and as well constructed as this Kyser one.  It is by far the best I've ever seen and I've been using it for years now and it still works fine.  It makes moving the capo quickly a cinch and the gold doesn't corrode or tarnish making it look like new even after all these years.Very highly recommended!	16
I've dropped my Maglite onto hard floors, submerged it in water, and subjected it to the abuses of a tornadic four year old. The all metal (not plastic!) case is nearly indestructible. Both ends are threaded and are fitted with snug o-rings to protect the innards from rain, humidity, and submersion. The lens housing twists to adjust the focus of the beam and comes off to allow it to be used as a candle (handy for nights in a tent or during a power outage). In addition, an extra bulb resides in the base!	12
In this game, you can build your own dream park with lots of rollar coaster, shops, merry-go-round, beautiful games, etc. You can design your own rollar coaster with any colour and can design your own park. Except this, you can also kill people in your park. You can build a non-finish rollar coaster and then start it, when the rollar-coaster-car reach there, it will throw away and 'BOMB', all the people in the car will die immediately! But this is a healthy game for children and kill people will diminish your park's rating so I don't think you should do that.	23
I go through a lot of these bulbs with my kitchen lighting. They are used in the under-cabinet lights and the pendant above the counter. About a year ago I replaced half of them with LEDs. This increased the life of the regular bulbs considerably (lower currents in the system means less wear and tear, so the speak). But they still burn out. These bulbs are a perfect replacement. They seem slightly less bright than say the GE brand that you get at the hardware store or the IKEA replacement bulbs, but the difference is barely noticeable. I give them a thumbs-up.	21
A very good high quality USB hub. Windows recognizes everything you plug into this hub and, the USB ports are nice and tight.I will say in my opinion, for a USB 2.0 hub, the Cyberpower-CP-H720 is at the top of the quality hub chart. You can plug a DVD player or web cam into this thing and it will work perfectly. My only complaint is a lack of a method of securing it to a table top but I suppose double sticky tape will do just fine. The rubber base piece is removable so it can lay flat as well.	7
yeah yeah...it says it's ginger so why hold back stars for strong taste?...because it's a biting, bitter ginger taste. I have to brew it w/add'l tea bag of other flavor to lighten the intensity...but w/theYogi Stomach Ease, Herbal Tea Supplement, 16-Count Tea Bags (Pack of 6)orOrganic Chamomile Tea 16 Bags(chamomile is more bland than stomach ease) the ginger is tolerable.Ginger DOES work for nausea but a quicker, less offensive relief can be had when eating a small piece of dried (sugared?) ginger. The tea I use for maintenance for a particular problem.	11
I've owned two of these feeders and my only complaint with the first one is that the yellow &#34;flowers&#34; come out too easily and get lost.  This resulted in wasps, bees, etc being able to drink the liquid.  I had used it a few years and am supposing they aren't meant to last that long.I bought another one just like it and have had no issues so far.  Otherwise, great feeder with large capacity.  It is very heavy, so I suggest hanging from your porch or a limb.	18
I watched this over and over with my son when he was little. Now I have a little granddaughter and she loves it too. This is a very fun movie. Karate kicking, pizza eating turtle boys are probably not the best influence but they are sweet (even Raf in his way) and well intentioned with a strong sense of right and wrong. Shredder is scary and bad but try to find a movie without an antagonist. And at the end of the day parents are a far bigger influence than any movie is ever gonna be.	6
I was disapointed to find that the reaction to this organic substance did not meet my needs.I have an ant problem in my house near where I keep my parrots.The population seemed to be less but the substance did not erraticate the ants.I am also concerned about pets that could injest poisons.Ironically a covering of table salt in the doorway and along the wall seems to confront the ants digestive symptoms and keep the pests more at bay.I used to use the typical ant traps with the poison that is spread to colony,but I am against chemicals that threaten my household pets.	18
I'm very pleased with this case. One piece that slips on fairly easily. It's not real grippy like some but has enough grab that you can hold onto it. Goes in and out of my holder and pocket easy enough. The stand on the back works great! When the stand is closed it's flush with the back of the case so it lays flat. Some cases, with stands, have hinges and parts that sick out. The blue is nice and true to on line image. I really like it. The price is amazing!	7
I have been taking B-complex vitamins for years but recently changed to these Twinlab vitamins. I definitely like the formulation of these better than any others I have taken, particularly because these include choline and inositol, both of which are helpful in stress/anxiety relief. The directions suggest taking two capsules a day. I tried this but unfortunately I just felt too jittery and uneasy after taking such a potent dose. Thankfully one capsule a day works great for me. They're great to get me through that 2:30 slump at work and help me sleep better as well.	12
It is not leather, and its smell is atrocious. However, if you're okay with leatherette, it does have some nice pockets inside and it's relatively thin/lightweight.I'd avoid this seller though (BoxWave Corp). Shipping is $5 and you will pay to return the item to them. For me, it was a total waste of money as the shipping costs alone are likely far more than the product is worth. I paid $30 for the case, $5 for shipping to me. I'll be sending it flat rate back. Bear Mountain cases are better, real leather, and cost less (about $20 for the iPad Mini).	7
I have 2 lawn mowers for summer and a snow blower for winter.  I have used Sta-bil for years in the gas can which I use for these machines for over 10 years.  The lawn mower sits around for months with gas in it over the winter.  Using Sta-bil prevents the &#8220;gum and varnish&#8221; residue that can be left behind when gasoline evaporates.  No need to drain the mowers or blowers every season.  The engines usually start right up after having been left idle for months.  Sta-bil has worked me and I will continue to use it.	2
Not happy with my Nook.  Be forewarned...you can pay for some books and they will download but you can't open them.  How to avoid this? Open up the description of your book on the buying site and make sure it says for Nook..and not nook color or nook etc...just Nook.  I've had to ask for credits several times already.There aren't enough books available in my opinion to justify using the darn thing. Maybe the Nook Color is a better bet?	10
Narration is OK but the story is weak and the songs are brilliantly unremarkable. I cringed when I watched this with my son. I admit I grew up with the original show with Jimmy Durante narrating and the title song a well written classic, rather than a lame paean to 1990's PC themes. This is probably inevitable in that you unfortunately can't re-make something from that era with the same innocence and feel: not in an era where Christmas has become lifeless. Oops! I said Christmas, I meant Happy Holidays!	15
...but somehow I managed to do it in this boxed video series, originally shown on BBC/PBS.  Francesca Annis's same-age doctor husband takes a young woman to his medical conference and the young doctor who works for him  makes sure his wife finds out.  This is because the younger man wants his  supervisor's wife for himself.  Naturally, the wife has to get even with  her husband and after all the young man is THERE....and so we go.  It's  compelling viewing as all of their lives come blasting apart.  I've just  bought the sequel, Reckless II, so I can keep apace of even more hanky  panky.	15
This summer and into the fall, my dogs went through a tick infestation.  I tried several different products, and this one worked the best.  I have 3 small dogs and I actually purchase the largest size tube and use a syringe to measure their dosage, which I found on another web site.  If you use these flea and tick products, you know how expensive it is.So, it works very well killing fleas and ticks and if you find out what your dog's dosage is, you can purchase larger tubes and save a bunch of money.	19
I'm a huge fan of OXO, and own lots of their utensils, but these are terrible. The cube ports do not have a lip, so water spills constantly on the trip from the counter to the freezer (even if you fill well below the rim, which results in a very small cube). The plastic cover, supposedly designed to keep out odors, leaves a gap all the way around the tray, making it easy for odors to penetrate the cubes (and adding to the spilled water annoyance). Don't waste your money; you will only be  frustrated.	13
The group in question is the Travelers--a band of con artists who have apparently been in the U.S. since the 19th century.  This show offers a glimpse into their world, and how odd and sometimes difficult it is for them to try to live among the rest of us.  Eddie Izzard and Minnie Driver do some pretty decent American accents as the husband and wife posing as the Riches.Complications ensue as they attempt to fill the deceased Riches' shoes, working, living, and going to school among the so-called Buffers (non Travelers).  Never a dull moment, as they say.	0
Jubran Kahlil Jubran had a teacher make a mistake on his name and wrote down 'Kahlil Gibran' as when he arrived here from Lebanon which was still part of the Ottoman Empire he went by Gibran Kahlil Gibran. His poetry is as timeless as his view towards life and the world at large - everyone was his friend! One passage  &#34;Half of what I say is meaningless, but I say it so that the other half may reach you&#34; was used by John Lennon in the white album on a tune called &#34;Julia &#34;.	5
I really enjoyed this story.  I found it hard to put my kindle down once I started reading about Max and Anna.  He lied to her for a good reason, he thought, but he almost lost her because of it. Aunt Abigail was really a shrewd lady and she had her nephew all figured out.  You must read this and form your own opinions from this story.  I loved it and will be waiting for the next great story from Raeanne Thayne.  It has got to be another great read.	14
"Stevie Wonder's dazzling versatility comes to the fore in this 1980 album. ""Hotter Than July"" runs the gamut from soulful reggae (""Master Blaster"") to social criticism (""Cash In Your Face"") and country funk (""I Ain't Gonna Stand for It""). The Martin Luther King tribute of ""Happy Birthday"" makes for a celebratory finish. Surprisingly underrated, ""Hotter Than July"" deserves a place alongside ""Innervisions"" (1973) and ""Songs in the Key of Life"" (1976)."	9
This little guy is one of the best frisbee designs ever. The Superdisc is easily the best frisbee to play catch with your friends, the rubber ring around makes it easy to throw and catch (Well, you have to get used to the extra grip when throwing it, people tend to hold on to it too long and it angles in the direction their arm moves).It holds itself pretty stable in the air as well, you can do long, straight throws with it.And as a bonus, the rubber prevents people from getting seriously hurt when hit (it still hurts though!)	20
People, i wrote this review to warn whatever of you out there want to buy this game.This will make even the most die hard game fans throw their playstations out the window.The games has most of the characters(whoopie...)which are represented with sub bar graphics and pitifull level desighn amoungst other things.the games boring.I rented it and it literally got old after 5 minutes of gameplay.If there is one redemable factor about this game its that you can laugh at how utterly stupid it is.Avoid this nerf dung at all costs.	23
I got this cincher for my holiday party dress, but it was awful. My boyfriend didn't like it at all. It cinched me in, but it was too long for my torso and added an extra &#34;curve&#34; where it ended. I didn't look like a better version of myself at all. I ended up not wearing it under the dress and just returned it.I also ordered the Fleece cincher based on reviews some people liked this one better and others that one. Similar issue there. I returned them both.	8
This is one of those products where you can never be completely sure if it is doing anything. But I just finished using it for the 40th time, after which it is recommended that you buy a new one, and all the players/burners I've used it on seem to be in fine working order. Whether they would be working as well if I didn't periodically clean them is impossible to say.The disc has several small brushes on it that clean the equipment's lens. It takes about one minute. There are also some additional features which I have never used.	10
"there are two 2pac album who rock:""all eyez on me""and... ""r u still down? (remeber me)""this album is super great.each song has it own image he own...topic which means,tupac had heart for everything. he was a really great person.i am an artist on my starting way and i'm from israel so i learnand get ideas for songs from pac. he rocks everything.i love this album in peticular b-cus of the songs, they still talks for real. so buy this as fast as you can, if you like tupac."	9
I'm shopping around for wireless speakers to use in a conference room at work so that I can pull in a few folks attending by teleconference.I'm sorry, but I just don't think there's any way I could set this up on my conference table without some of my colleagues having to work very hard to conceal a grin, or even a snicker.The problem, to put it delicately, is that the antenna is, well, er, it's um, kinda... WELL, JUST LOOK AT IT!  A possible distraction.	10
88min DVD containing the famous concert on Central Park featuring the one-night reunion of Paul Simon and Art Garfunkel. The concert looks and sounds good on this DVD. Even the John Lennon song where an angry fan rushed the stage is included. Also included in this DVD are some movie trailers which include: Carmen Jones, Carousel, Hello Dolly!, The King & I, Moulin Rouge!, Oklahoma!, and South Pacific. Additionally, there is English subtitles. Nice concert DVD for S&G fans inspite of Garfunkel looking a bit uncomfortable during the concert.	6
This book is almost paranormal erotica. The plot is thin and unresolved, but the sex scenes are hot. Had the Euro wolf white slaver ring plot point actually been followed and tied up this book would have been really good. But the entire plot resolution took a dozen sentences at best. Not particularly satisfying for mystery and police procedural fans like me.I like a good shifter romance as long as they aren't saccharine bodice busters, but this book wasn't nearly as deeply written as this talented writer could have made it.	14
The minute I saw this my heart skipped a beat. What a nice case to sort my collection. I love all the compartments and the layout too. You will love this color too. If this is a gift do not hesitate. It will please even the most fussy, as I am. The price is fair if you check around as I did. Seems well made too. It is suitable for an adult though. Not meant as a toy. This is for serious jewelry lover's. Buy it.....	8
The only issue is if it's moved, I have to flip it upside down to 'straighten' it back out. It goes lopsided! But it works great when it's flat (and straightening it out isn't a huge deal). The main purpose was to get my kids something to jump on besides the couch, since that seemed to be a hidden passion of theirs. ;) They love to bounce on it, and so do it! Its a great leg workout. We're all happy for the purchase!	20
The first time we played this game with my 7 and 10 year old daughter they didn't like it and were easily distracted.  We played it the next day and they really thought it was fun.  The math from adding who was winning was easy for each girl and after everyone had a couple of turns we stopped and had the kids add up who was ahead.  You definitely need an adult to explain it the first few times but after that they get the idea.  I like where it takes them and would recommend it to other families.	22
Esme is abused by her father after her mother leaves them.  Seeking a way out she is going to marry until she realizes the man is just as awful (and as old as) her father.  When she witnesses the scene across the street she decides that Captain Radwell is the man to ruin her and get her away from her father.  What she doesn't count on is the honorable streak that he is trying to have.  He delivers her to his brother and his wife for help.  And then he sticks around.  Great read!	14
I bought for my nephew's birthday...he's 4 years old.  I loved the idea of giving him the ability to write his own book, illustrate it, and then to be able to have a real one made was just cool.  Initially, the concept was a tad lost on him, but he soon understood.  Once he understood he was really excited.  A cool little present but it also a present that the parents or another adult will have to help with....it an activity...a memory.  I have not seen the finished book as of yet but will update when I do.	22
This cable seems top-notch to me.  Some complaints I heard had to do with this brand not lasting.  (Of course, those guys abuse their equipment.)  Maybe that will be something I'll encounter, but this cable appears to be very well made--and it works great.  I take very good care of my gear, so I expect this one to last.  Only gave it four out of five because I'd rate some other cables slightly higher.  This a great cable, the length is perfect for practice, and I'd buy another.	16
bought a pair of these (price listed is per individual wiper) for my wife's 2004 Audi A4.  I had earlier purchased a pair of Silblade wiper blades, but found their plastic adapter a poor, weak fit to the Audi's wiper arm.  These Valeo's fit, with a slide locking attachment exactly like OEM.  It will NOT fly off your arm (unlike the Silblades...see my review on those).  I can't comment on longevity, but my wife says they do a great job--quiet and competent...	2
"Superior casting, direction, and production values have produced a superior film that stays true to Austen's classic novel without the excessive cloying ""cutesyfying"" of Gwenyth Paltrow's depiction of the title role.I am genuinely stunned that there are reviewers here who expressed preference for the Paltrow film (which is more a parody of ""Clueless"" than anything else.  Yes, I understand ""Clueless"" is a modern retelling of ""Emma"" but it is still different in several pertinent ways.)  Beckinsale's portrayal is EXACTLY how I would expect Emma Woodhouse to look and behave if she were a living breathing person.Thank A & E for giving us a ""real"" Emma."	15
I am fairly disappointed with this after being so pleased w/the stand.  The tent is short and most cats like stand up straight to poo.  Also, the velcro already attached (not nearly enough to do anything) to the tent releases when attached to the velco pad we must attach to the stand.  Lastly the tent is to help keep the litter from spreading, which this does not do.  there are only four 1-inch patches of velcro, the rest is open for the litter to fall all around the unit.  Don't waste your $$ on this accessory.	19
Years ago someone gave me one of this type eye pillow and I have loved it.  The fragrance was very soothing and really aided my relief from migraines.  The company that manufactured it has since been sold and I was looking for a replacement.  DreamTime is the perfect replacement.  It has the exact aroma and is well made as was the first one.  I also have ordered one for my daughter and she enjoys hers as well.  I recommend to these to everyone I know who has migraines.	4
"I have a large collection of ""historic family photos"" which needed proper identification. I tried one of the ""photos pens"" from Amazon but it leaked through the paper and ruined a photo. This is not only permanent but looks professional. The cost is secondary here to the functionality. PS - By adjusting the margin setting, printing on the middle font size, and using the return key to create a two line label, you can save valuable tape. Using the ""memory"" function you can avoid typing common entries too many times.Agreed the tape is expensive but it is a class act."	10
We buy these for my 89-year-old mother.  It is so much easier than having a little bottle that she cannot get the top off of.We buy them on Amazon.com because we live in a remote area of Montana and shopping is 60 miles one-way away (besides, the prices are up to 40% higher and with Amazon delivering FREE to our door within 48 hours, why go anywhere else?)Anyway, these are the same name brand I have bought elsewhere for a lot more and they are excellent.	12
We have two of these gates that we use to contain the babies (15 mo. and 4 mo.) IN the living room and to keep the dog OUT of the living room.  Easily installed and adjustable.  We haven't had to use any extensions.  15 mo. old can't open it but 6 yr. old nephew can operate it easily on his own.  We are buying a third one of these to keep the 15 mo. old out of the laundry room.  They are WONDERFUL!	3
Sorry, I'm just not a fan.  This stone does ok for tools like shovels or axes, but I just couldn't get the hang of it with knives.  The diamond stones were too coarse and seemed to really grab the edge and prevent you from maintaining your angle.  The absurdly fat handle also gets in the way when you're trying to sharpen, rending a good quarter of the stones useless for most tasks.  I ended up picking up a set of credit card diamond stones and am much happier with my result.	20
If I'm reviewing the author's writing style and creation of charact6ers, then this book gets 6 stars. If I'm revewing the fact that this is another of those &#34;books&#34; that are barely more than a couple of mid-sized paragraphs, then this book gets 1 star. I'm tired, frankly, of wasting my time (and my money) on these things that are not even good &#34;short stories&#34; - but instead, attempts to rake in a few more publishing dollars. I'd love to see what this author could do given the assignment to write a real-life sized book.	14
i bought jack in the box years ago for my son when he was little.  he got scared atfirst when the jack in the box popped out.  after that he became friends with the guy whenhe jumped out.  so i bought this one for my great grand son for christmas.  well, he didn'tget scared when the guy jumped out, but never the less, he learned how to close it andis getting the hang of winding it, and laughs when the guy jumps out.  keeps him busy.	22
I am very thankful I chose this particular pack-n-play. I've seen the ones my friends have for their babies and I definitely got the best one!!! It also folds up easily and stores nicely. It is a little heavy, but they all are to me. It is sturdy and I think it will last. Sheets that fit this particular model are pricey, though, as it's not the average rectangular shape. Other than that, it is perfect! My daughter loves it and so do I!	3
Robinson's Mars Trilogy begins as admirably written hard science fiction, based for the most part on physics and geology.  As the story progresses, the plot is based more and more upon Robinson's previous suppositions than on fact - in short, he begins to extrapolate.  By the last page of the last book, we're asked to believe that human beings can postpone death almost indefinitely, have solved the problem of war, and are ready to colonize space, all in about three hundred years.  My willing suspension of disbelief wore out about two-thirds of the way through the last book.	5
I passed this series up more than one time thinking it was just another reality show.  When I finally did give it a shot, I was hooked!  Having watched the first season on Netflix, I knew I had to buy the rest to find out what enterprising shenanigans Michael could come up with next.  I really really don't like the way the last season ended.  I think it was a rip off to &#34;set aside&#34; a very big part of this series in a two hour dvd that isn't part of the original seasons.	0
Great if you need to work on an old school computer tower and don't have an adapter plug for your miniDin6 plug.As most of the old school users will remember, these adapters came with every keyboard and computer system until the motherboard manufacturers finally switched over the standard input type. It was a welcome change too!These plugs are very handy to have especially if you do any computer work such as repairs, mods or upgrades. it's a tool you'll suffer without if you don't keep it in your toolbox.	10
"I'm a new shooter and also have my first revolver (Ruger SP101 with 3"" barrel). I got this because everyone else with a semi-automatic has their extra magazines, and I wanted extra ready ammo also. The local gun stores sell this same HKS item for $12 and up; I paid less than $10 here on Amazon. I plan to buy one or two more. Of course, I can't find .38 Special ammo anywhere in my area to load it with... (and I'm too small to even want to try .357 if I can even find it). Recommended!"	20
A great introduction for those who missed out (like I did), but not so much a documentary or a concert. I supposed it is very difficult to fit 3 days into the time alloted, but it's oftentimes very difficult to watch as  some songs are cut short... the cameramen can't find the subject they're  shooting... the filmmakers often focus on mundane topics rather than  grabbing the full excitement of the event. Don't get me wrong - it's a  great piece of history - it just doesn't seem to capture the best of it,  IMHO.	6
I have used these &#34;pick-like&#34; objects by another brand that contained no metal, and they worked well but did not have any specifically for tight areas.  I tried these.  The sharp metal kept hurting my gums, and were not small enough for the tight areas after all.  In between the teeth where they did fit, it didn't feel like they cleaned as well as the stiff rubber ones by the other brand.  These picks are a good idea, but the others worked much, much better for me.  I would not recommend these.	12
I wasn't sure if I was going to like this as I was buying it online, but it is the perfect size and I love the big numbers and  ... my husband keeps trying to steal it! I have relatively small hands and a narrow wrist so was concerned about the size of the watch face because I know some of them are rather large (for a man's wrist) ... this one is perfect!TIP: I measured the top of my wrist to get an idea of what size watch face would work.	8
This is the second one of these I have purchased.  I bought the last one several years ago and it is still running strong.  I wanted a second one to keep upstairs.  This little Quick Up is exactly as advertised. What a time saver.  It is  light and weight has considerable suction for a cordless.  It is a little Go To machine and I think anyone would be glad they purchased it.  This would be a great gift I think anyone would be delighted to receive.change	13
I read the reviews and synopses for Stormy Glenn's whole Tri-Omega series. The stories and premise seemed great, and they were. Unfortunately, I could barely get through them. These books were filled with misspellings, grammatical errors, mistakes, omissions, and every other intensely annoying thing that can be done to novels to render them all but unreadable. If you're able to get past that without losing your connection with the story, you'll really enjoy the series. If, like me, slamming into some huge error in the writing derails your train of thought, you'd be better off moving on.	14
I bought these for my father-in-law. he's approximately 5' 7&#34;-8&#34;, 36&#34; waist. I got him size 42 and they're perfect. Off they look like they could house two people, but with a layer of sweatpants, sweat shirt, boots, gloves - they're just right. &#34;Not hugging the boys&#34;, or pulling up when bending over or reaching. They are a bit stiff, so there is a break in period needed for maximum comfort and maneuverability. heavily lined.	8
I didn't like this hose nozzle as much as other reviewers.  For the price, I was expecting an amazing nozzle.  It is heavy, sturdy, and looks like it will be very durable, but I do not like the selection of the spray patterns compared to the $5 hose nozzles at home improvement stores.  The rubber areas are comfortable to hang on to.This would be great for washing a car or big jobs like hosing down a pool or screens, but for watering potted plants and trees, this nozzle puts too much water down and creates splashing.	2
As others note, battery insertion is pretty hard and takes enough force that the plastic must be close to breaking.  My first set of these worked for an hour and then one earpiece stopped amplifying and instead it started buzzing and whining.  Amazon quickly replaced them (good job Amazon) and the new set has worked so far.  And I didn't break them putting in the batteries, but maybe next time?  Anyway, low profile, good at blocking sound, and the audio gain is sufficient to help with hearing people talk.	20
"i have for over two years the lasko box fan that i use in bedroom and it works very well,but being an idiot when i came to amazon to order another one i was too lazy to look up my old order and ordered this one becuse ""it looks the same"".  its not.  the 3723 model from two years ago is fabulous.. really cools a mid size room.  this newer model you have to be within 2 feet to even feel any aire.  buy the 3723http://www.amazon.com/Lasko-20-Inch-Premium-Box-3-SPEED/dp/B000HHJ2I2/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid;=1344856518&sr;=8-1&keywords;=lasko+3723"	13
Swingline manufactures an easy to use solid stapler. The only reason this stapler did not get five stars is because Swingline manufacturers a slightly more modern looking stapler that performance is identical.In testing I was able to stable 31 sheets consistently and occasionally 33 sheets. The stapler has a hinge release that allows you to stable things to walls or other flat surfaces. The base has a plastic/rubber coating that adds grip and prevent scraping. All other components appear to be metal. I anticipate this stapler lasting for well over 20 years.	17
This was a great find.  Hard to find Avengers series.  If you like Spy, SciFi, Comedy, Action, Adventure all wrapped in one this series is for you.  I had the Avengers series on VHS especially Diana Rigg (Emma Peel) years.  Unfortunately over time VHS don't play as well.  Although these series are not in HD they play pretty good on the big screen.  This was a decent price as these are now out of print.  They arrived in great condition and play excellent on my blu ray.  I am very impressed.  Dianna Rigg years are the best where she played Emma Peel.	15
I started out with a Little Giant 17' ladder many years ago.  It is a terrific ladder - strong, lightweight and easy to use.  However, for oudoor work on 2 story houses and trees, this 22' is much better suited.Both of my Little Giant ladders are great.  I have stored them outside in the hot desert shade for a decade or so with no ill effects.The clear advantage of the 17' over the 22' is that it's considerably lighter and easier to set up.  If you're an aging baby boomer, the 22' may require some help to extend and use.Recommended.	21
"I don't get it- you have to carry around the board and the pen...what is the difference between this and simply bringing a pen and pad of paper?  I was disappointed.  After reading all of the great reviews, I guess I expected something special!  We played it a few times when we first got it, but since then it has been sitting untouched (for about six months).  However, we frequently play the ""old-fashioned"" hangman in waiting rooms, restaurants, etc. ...when it just isn't convenient to carry around the board.  Overall, a waste of money!"	22
Such a easy tool for our energized puppies! I had some problems with my wrist. It causes trouble for me when I throw a ball.I could not play with my 2 young dogs. This tool is so easy for me. I can throw a ball for them far and fast enough that they have to run hard to catch it.Even my 5 year old son can easily get the ball over 100 yards away.Dogs love it! Works great for us.The size is perfect. but we did not try the long one.	19
I am in Alaska.  They say that the .44 mag is the perfect bear gun, but a lightweight revolver is darn near impossible to find. I went with the .44 special bulldog.  It's light and it may not be a mag, but it will work.  I bought two speed loader which gives me 15 rounds. These fit on my belt by my holster within easy reach and I have not bumped or brushed into them causing any problems when I motorcycle offroad. The snaps are solid but easy to pop.  This worked for me.	20
We bought this natural fertilizer mainly following the recommendations of hobby gardener friends.  We did read some Amazon reviews.  Blind believers, once the small bag arrived (different from the Amazon image / supplier), we applied the Azomite first, studying the facts afterwards.  Not sure which surprised us more?  While not overnight, plant growth and vigor were perceptible amazingly fast; almost dramatically.  Either the soils had been depleted prior to the Azomite application or the added nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium did wonders.  Be it as it may, we bought a much larger bag.  Highly recommended.	18
We've only played a few times, but so far we haven't found this card game lives up to the other reviews.  There are basically 3 types of cards: goal, action and keeper/creeper.  Goals can (possibly) change from one player to the next, so you don't plan ahead. Actions can take several minutes to play depending on what they are, so even with 4 playing, it may be 5-7 minutes before your turn comes around again, so hasn't held our interest.	22
My friend Melissa got me into Flyleaf just recently. Man have i been missing out!i absolutly love All Around Me and Sorrow, but the rest of the CD is worth a listen too. I also like There for you and Fully Alive. very powerful songs, with lyrics that arent just any old lyrics, you actually feel the emotions in these songs. Plus there are acoustic versions, a definete must.The dvd includes footage of the performances as well as the videos for I'M So Sick,Fully Alive and All Around Me. the videos are awesome. You like Flyleaf, get this!	6
As I say in the title, I'm new to Analog having subscribed to it only by Kindle. I'm loving it. I had no idea the Kindle version was more expensive than the print version. While I find this curious, I don't have a preexisting view of a fair price for this magazine. As such, I think the $2.99 per month with instant delivery to a much more pleasant reading format (Kindly versus paper), I'm pretty happy.My delight in Analog is a credit both to the magazine and to the Kindle. I'm thoroughly loving this.	14
I like this stand better than others I've used just due to the fact of the ladder design which catches the wood when you cut it.  The stand is a bit heavy compared with others but the big pneumatic wheels help quite a bit with that.  Also the ability to move it around on the job site by yourself is quite handy.  I just use it with the saw sitting on it, I do keep some small Bessey clamps on it to clamp the tool down if you prefer.  Works great with my planer as well.	21
Makes ice cream! I am on a no carb diet.. but I didn't want to give up my favorite frozen treat. This makes ice cream.. takes maybe 20 minutes.. the ice cream holder itself requires about 24hrs to freeze prior to use. You can of course use it before 24 hours.. but its more like a milkshake.. which is also fine  :)I have never used an ice cream maker before this one. My boyfriend has a self refrigerating one.. he said this one is A LOT quieter.I love it.	13
The ability to leave my MP3 music (cell phone) in my gym bag and get a serious workout without disruption is worth the price along. Being on call, it's also important that I don't miss any of those important phone calls. Getting interrupted with a voice announcement of who's calling makes it all worthwhile. After the first use I was hooked. All of my weekday workouts are with my bluetooth stereo headset. As for the weekends, I'm back to the Zune, not because I dislike the headphones, because I need to escape from the phone.	7
This gate was perfect for our split-level home with the addition of one 24&#34; extension. It does the job of keeping the baby away from the stairs and the dog out of where she isn't allowed. My husband said it was very easy to install. The stay-open and auto-close features are great. I plan on buying another for the bottom set of stairs.The only reason I gave it four stars instead of five is because I do feel like it could be slightly sturdier for the abuse my three-year-old tries to give it.	3
I purchased this because I was basically afraid to take my kindle anywhere without the case, and I love Moleskine notebooks.  The surface of the cover is soft... not like a normal Moleskine notebook.  The top left elastic strap does (minorly) interfere with the operation of the on switch.  It doesn't really bother me all that much though.  I have had mine for a week or two now, and it still has a chemical smell to it.  Be prepared to let it air out for a while.	10
It's Rush, it's brilliant. No more needs to be said-Except for one thing-For some reason, my copy is in a jewel case and not the digipak that every other copy of this album I've seen has been packaged in. You say, &#34;So what?&#34; Well, to a geek like me, that makes it some kind of &#34;One of a kind&#34; thingy. Is it a bootleg? I don't believe so-So, nanapoopoo stick your head in doodoo, mine is in a jewel case.	6
I used to use this to protect my large German shepherd mix up until the day he passed away at 15.5 years old.  He never had any issues with fleas while on this product.I recently adopted two small dogs, about 20 pounds each.  I use one packet to treat both of them.  I bought some 1 cc syringes and some dispensing needles and just split the content of one pack evenly between my two dogs.  Saves me a lot of money AND they get a proper dosage of the medicine.	19
I recently got a new job and have been driving an hour a day to get to it.  So I started taking coffee in this deep thermos mug which quickly became soiled.  This brush really does the trick and I have found it so useful for other cleaning operations.  Not good as a toothbrush, but good back scratch!  I took of one star because it doesn't really look so good, and the whole to hang it should be a smidge bigger so it goes over hooks more easilier.	12
Nair has been around forever, and there's a reason why. It's the best, and at a fair price.You do have to use a lot of the product, especially if using it on your chest and legs.There is a very strong chemical smell, but it's not a deal breaker. You also have to be careful. If you leave it on to long, you could get burned. Read the instructions on the bottle, test it on a small patch of hair, and you will be fine.Excellent for removing hair. I wouldn't use it on certain parts of my anatomy though.	12
I love this app in theory and it is adorable.I have it on my Mytouch 4G, and it uses the front facing camera by default.  However,  the pictures show up as nothing but streaks of color or black and grey.  When I use the rear camera this doesn't happen.I like the app but would love to be able to use the front facing camera and have the pictures come out right!I also contacted customer service a week ago,  and after an initial response asking what version of Android I had,  I have not heard back.	1
This moose is possibly the best tool on the market for large, flat surfaces.  Use it for table tops and counter tops.  It works especially well for flattening self-edges for plastic laminate work.At over fifteen pounds, it's too heavy for delicate work or small projects, but get it on a large area and it floats effortlessly across the surface.The new whisper series feature is a treat and the dust bag works very well.  All in all this tool gives the most bang for the buck in it's class.  But do yourself a favor-buy a couple of little sanders to keep big boy company.	21
I&#8217;ve used it several times and it doesn&#8217;t miss a beat.  (Staples not included).  It is very smooth and fits my girly hand just fine.It is made of &#8220;50% recycled content&#8221; which I assume is the plastic.  There is a coating over the outside, that I cannot feel (which is good), that is supposed to be antimicrobial.  Since staplers can get as germy as phones, that is probably a good thing too.The price is $7.99 so I am putting this in a winner&#8217;s category.	17
This season 2 and all other seasons in this series is very educative to watch. You will find the host Mr. Mike Rowe&#8217;s comments very entertaining. Mike has gone to some extraordinary lengths to participate in these series and show us an array of episodes how hard some honest people work in this country to make our lives easier. If these honest people did not do their dirty jobs as portrayed in the series then civilized life on earth would not have been possible. Sincere thanks to all hardworking individuals who made these series a hit.	0
"I did not know what I was buying when I purchased this item. At first I was puzzled that it was not black, after all it is ""black"" tapioca. I was planning to use the black tapioca in chocolate tapioca pudding. I went ahead and cooked some and discovered it does indeed turn black after cooking. But now I am not sure what to do with it because the package directions are unclear. I did an internet search for some bubble tea recipes which should not be necessary. None the less, the tea looks interesting."	11
"In our politically correct USA this movie doesnt fit anything. Yes, most facts are not readily available. This movie shows only facts but not what led to all these human disasters. Some other facts are missing like comrade Stalin mass killing his own military leaders. By accident I own a DVD from Russia with promising title ""Dictators"" which does include comrade Hitler and comrade Stalin the point being is Russian DVD include only safe facts which make all DVD laughable but this is how we are trying to rewrite history. Use safe facts and worry about nothing."	15
I love RATM. I was at the Irvine Meadows concert shown in this video - unfortunately, that one is the worst of the ones shown. It was a great show, but it's just poor quality. Part of that is because it's at night,  but it also seems kind of poor anyway. The other shows are pretty good, but  the video has flaws. The video collection is cool though, although the ones  from the first album are basically just Rage live, they're awesome.	6
I am a fan of the darker, nonconsent stuff (let's not beat around the bush and call it &#34;dubious consent&#34;) and though it would have been easy to fall into despair for the character's circumstances, the author wove a story that had enough depth to it that I wanted to read more.  I did find the treatment by the police officers a little baffling (in this day and age with the awareness of mental health issues) but it set up the ending nicely.  I can't wait to read Book 2.  I hope this is a world that the author will continue with someday.	14
We're not much pleased with this brush. It's way smaller than we wanted and, owing to the angle of the head, one has to get their hand in much closer in to the grubby dish or pot they're scrubbing. That makes it hard to apply much force. We bought another brush in the same order, the Libman Kitchen Brush which Amazon also sells and which is a mite cheaper. It's a far better brush, bigger and better designed. This one is ok but not good enough to recommend.	12
I was a little skeptical after the fist season ended since Christopher Eccleston was no longer going to be The Doctor.  I really loved him.  But, since I had become a fan of the series, I decided to give the 2nd season a try, starting with the Christmas episode...David Tennant's first episode.I am so glad I gave it a try!  David Tennant's interpretation of the 10th Doctor is superb.  He is great fun to watch.  If you are not sure about this season, give this episode a try ... you won't be sorry!	0
These are the best.  When you get them out of the bag, you might think you ordered panties that were 2 or 3 sizes too small, but that's just the way they look until you try them on.  They fit great.  They hold in your stomach quite a bit and the leg opening doesn't ride up in the back.  Stays put.  These also come in a lace waist band that rests lower (on your hip).  I have that style too and it is  nice but I like these better.	8
I remember playing this at my friend's house when I was a kid, and forgot how much fun we used to have!  Bought it for my kids, and we love it.  It's really a game for the whole family.I don't think my young children could have really handled moving the pieces correctly around the board by themselves before they turned 5, and the counting reinforces early math skills.  Unlike other games they've played (Candyland, Chutes & Ladders, Hi Ho Cherry-O), this game is dependent upon strategy as much as chance.  Perfect for kindergartners and up!	22
I bought the IRIS pet food container because it's air tight and has wheels.  33 Quarts is good for the 17 pound bag of dog food we have.  The label says it can hold 25+ pounds of cat food, 26+ pounds of dog food, or 44+ pounds of bird seed.The wheels role smoothly, the lid fits snugly.  There's a latch on one side and a hinge on the other, so the lid stays attached and open when I'm scooping out food.  Works great.	19
Ok, so I just installed these things for my KRK 6's (no stands...just sitting on two other speakers).  What can I say?  The bass, which previously had disappeared in my studio, is now present again!  My monitors sounded kinda thin before because I was losing so much energy to my desk, but these things have made a ton of difference!  My stereo image even feels wider now!Sure, they're a little pricy, but hey...THEY WORK!  If that's what they want to charge for them, and people continue to buy them, I'm cool with that!  I'm happy with the reults my $40 got me!5/5!	16
I am giving this three stars because I didn't really give it a chance. my qualms with this app were two things: the fact it auto starts, and also that it was a big pain to uninstall on my droid x2. I downloaded it and installed and there was no choice in turning it on or off, it just starts up. then not liking that fact I tried to uninstall it and it wasn't in my app list. might be a great app but I just didn't like the design or functionality of it.	1
It's an average quality case/skin and will do the trick. Beware: If you get the Amazon bundle with the Screen Protector and Headphone adapter, you will be paying shipping for each of the three items. FYI - this has no bearing on my rating of this case, just know that the two cents more that you pay is not all you pay after figuring the shipping - it's more like $12 more. Avoid the bundle and buy it all from the same seller to avoid the triple ship charge. ;)	7
I got this for my Nexus 7 tablet. It works as expected, allowing me to search for and order items, and also to access my previous orders, wishlist, etc.  The user interface is considerably simplified compared to the full browser page version. That's appropriate because most Android devices, smartphones and tablets, have much less screen area to display info.  It's a free app, so there's no downside to trying it out. You may like it. If not, you can always user your browser app to connect to Amazon.com	1
The best non-toxic products by far, the honeysuckle fragrance is not available in the stores, it minimizes the chore of doing dishes.  My husband enjoys washing the dishes, because he likes the smell.  We're in the process of demolishing our kitchen, so a dishwasher won't be installed soon enough, but this liquid dish soap cleans, cuts grease, foams well with small drops, plus gives aromatherapy in the kitchen.  Meyer's cost more, but the concentrated product goes a very long way, great value.	4
Too cute! Takes me back.... I HAD to purchase it as soon as I saw it. I bought it for my dog b/c I knew she'd rip it to shreds and Mr. Bill would cry out at the same time. What a riot!!! My dog is a lab and would gently carry Mr. Bill around in her jowls. When she'd bite down, Mr. Bill cried out - cracks me up. She played tug-o-war with it with my sister's dog, too. Within a short period of time, Mr. Bill was sadly torn to shreds, but it was fun while he lasted!	19
This is the best mount I have ever found, especially for the price.Home Depot has a nearly identical mount for $90.This mount comes with every fastener you could need from Lags, Hollow Wall Anchors, Spacers, to varying lengths of Metric Fasteners to most if not all TVs.They mount easy and are sturdy; I have a 60&#34; LED TV on one without issue.I also have 32&#34;, 42&#34;, 46&#34;, and 50&#34; TVs on them; I have used these to mount every LED/LCD TV I or friends have mounted.	10
Many people have compared this offshoot of the Stargate franchise as a Battlestar Galactica wannabe. Since I've never seen the newest BSG series, I can't compare it myself. So, I'll just say that I loved this newest SG installment and wish that it hadn't been cancelled after Season 2. However, even though it was cancelled, it was just so much fun. Now, the stars are off doing other series. However, if I ever win the Lotto, I will personally fund a TV movie or another season of this show. I miss the characters and would like to see them again.	0
These wipes are a great find. As many have mentioned, they are not easy to find in stores and you cannot beat the price on Amazon. I use them as an adult, just recently, for nights. I am too lazy to wash my face and these wipes have been a great help in clearing up my dull skin. I find they are gentl and non-drying. They have a light, pleasant smell to them as well. My only wish is that they come in a subscribe and save option.	4
I had intended to carry this, with my keys, attached to my chain wallet. But the wallet hasn't arrived yet so be warned it is a little bit of a pocket space eater. But I suspected it would be before I ordered it so I don't count that against it. Holds 3 medium picks with grip exceptionally tight...almost annoyingly hard to get one out. Will be sure to update if wear & tear has any effect on the grip on the picks. But so far, so great and would consider purchasing this for my musically inclined friends.	16
For the price, this is one of the best pop filters. It easily clamps onto my stand and doesn't move around after I place it. However, there is one problem I've had with it. It can easily lose grip of the arm holding the filter. What I mean is that, if I pick up the mic, the arm will swivel away. Granted this was caused by me dropping it once, but before it was fine. So for a good price you get a filter that works.	16
It works, however unless you need to watch your cycles on a long term basis (infertility, PCOS, etc) I found a website that sells very cheap ovulation test strips. Google early-pregnancy-tests. For a 'normal' person this site is what I recommend over these strips, due to cost. With that said, this machine does work (remember you must by the $150-200 monitor to use these strips) though it is pricey when the above mentioned site has test strips for a fraction of the price. Again, for long term issues (infertility, multi preg, etc), this machine is a good investment.	12
Well...Where to begin.  This game is excellent.  That's basically all I need to say.  It's main game has a nice plot, your a scientist whose expieriment went wrong and you must do some stuff...AND SHOOT STUFF ALONG THE WAY!!!  Most enemies are Smart, and tactically try to kill you, and the &quot;Puzzles&quot; are fun too.  Plus, Deathmatch is fun, and all the &quot;mods&quot; by other people make the game infinately replayable.If you like First Person Shooters/action games at all, you simply must try this.	23
The graphic violence in this story shocked me, which doesn't happen very often (that's coming from someone who has read heaps of true crime and horror books). Maybe it was only because I wasn't expecting it. This is definitely one of the best $.99 books I've downloaded on my Kindle to date. I especially loved the ending, but the fact that I was so amused by it (I think I actually laughed out loud before I realized that maybe I shouldn't be) leaves me questioning my mental health just a teeny bit. Recommend to those who aren't squeamish.	14
I drink Green tea most of the day. After 5:00pm or so I switch to camomile tea. It keeps me calm and promotes better sleep at night.I tried several teas and this is one of my favorite taste-wise.Being a Baby Boomer I am more aware of natural ways to stay healthy and enjoy life. I'm always looking for ways to improve without artificial products.If your nerves get jittery then you want to give this tea a try.Lambert Klein Author ofAnti-Aging for Baby Boomers and Everyone Else Naturally	11
This is surely Don Henley's best album, ripe with not only his trademark sarcastically, clever, and sometimes cynically honest lyrics; but with full-out music and arrangements. Beautiful, reflective songs such as the title track, If Dirt Were Dollars, and New York Minute are among his best. Also, rounding out the album, are heartfelt ballads like The Heart of the Matter and The Last Worthless Evening. The former is one of my favorite ballads, and the latter is noteworthy for it's clever lyrics. If you're looking for a Don Henley album, this wouldn't be a bad place to start.	9
I use these for assisting in a low carb diet. I test for Ketosis daily and they definitely help keep me on track better than without-- it takes the guessing out it. Foolproof to use, results are instant and the colors are bright and easy to read. There are cheaper varieties out there which I have also tried but these are the fastest and they seem to be more accurate and reliable. Cheaper brands have given me results all over the place. If you use 1 or 2 a day a box will last you a long time.	12
These bottles are pretty good.  The nipple is a little large and seems to flow kinda fast for my breastfed baby.  She makes quite a mess while drinking from these.  However, the bottle is nice and durable.  The nipple and caps fit snug.  Also, they work great as breast milk storage containers.  You can take out the nipple and put the insert in the cap for freezer storage.  I like that.  My daughter doesn't get a bottle often, but when she does this in one of the types I use.	3
Maybe I just got a bad unit, but my batteries ran out after only a few hours of use. The memory unit runs on two type CR2032 batteries. Now, the problem with this is that these batteries are so expensive that replacing them costs about 3/8 the price of the VMU. Kinda expensive if you ask me. It is still a great idea however, and I recommend picking at least one up. I have a few games for Dreamcast and they would have been somewhat less enjoyable without the unit. I just hope your batteries last longer than mine did.	23
It took guts for Sting to walk away from The Police at the height of their popularity to create a rock band of jazz musicians. This fact is not lost when you see Synchronicity Concert.The huge, mullet-headed audience at The Omni in Atlanta was somewhat intert but still enthusiastic. While there are a few crowd reaction shots, they don't interfere with the visual experience.The only flaws I can find are that the camerawork is stiff and amaturish at times and Spirits In The Material World is too annoying to watch.Overall, this is the best (only?) document of the end of The Police.[DW]	6
A mistake to buy for younger kids Igift for six year old) because so hard to make out the hands with moving lizards going round and round. an excellent design were it larger but it is smaller than expected - my fault as i didn't check the size. however it is sturdy and attractive, so i will wear it for myself at times - for fun. I didn't return as it was so inexpensive and just replaced it for intended gift, with a digital watch. haven't seen that yet.	8
Most games with a joystick of any type is quite hard to play without a physical controller on android, but this is by far the best I have come across. This can be attributed to its side-scrolling platform, but this just enhances play as the difficulty of 3D is taken away but replaced with loads enemies flying across your screen with different capabilities. You even get new planes after playing certain levels, which is great when you need that edge to beat a level that you can't do with your favorite plane.	1
Phoenix plays a character very similar to the lethargic James Dean or early Brando.  It took me over half the movie to get used to him and appreciate the character.  I can't say I enjoyed it, but again, I appreciated his acting.  Paltrow, well, pretty and pouty - anyone could have played her part. Interesting ending that would be worth the argument at a party with a bunch of opinionated men and women. Hey, that might be a reason to watch it!  There ya go!	0
I recieved this ebook complimentry and it just blew my mind. The characters will just blow you away. Eric AKA Rauel really makes you think what would you do in his position and would you be able to do the things he did mostly from watching tv or finding out details on the internet. It feels like you are right there with him from the beginning until the end biting your fingernails the whole way. I cant wait to read more from this author. Sit down and take a deep breath and enjoy the ride.	14
From his wit, warmth, and brilliantly precise and accurate use of language, to a band that cannot be topped, as a whole or as individual players, this is a transcendent performance.  His voice is gorgeous, his use of words sharp and equisite, so apt no other words could do, and his demeanor joyful and welcoming.And that's the singing part of it.As great and seriously fun are his thematic interludes and poems.Stellar all around.Difficult to find, prices at premium, yet worth every penny, dime, and dollar.	6
It actually works well for the iPhone 5 also.  Durable and well made.  Comfortable to wear.  My last one broke after about 2 years....and I liked it so much that I reordered the exact same one.Update:  After a couple of months, the metal piece on the flap came out.  The magnets seem to be stronger than necessary and put a good tug on the simple method to keep that piece attached.  Still, it's inexpensive and I am re-ordering a new one because I like everything else about it,	7
I purchased a total of 4 of these, thinking I needed to change the bedding constantly due to spit up.The instructions said to hang dry only so I thought I needed more to get through the week.  It turns out I can just toss it in the dryer and put it right back on the mattress.Had I known I didn't need to hang dry, I wouldn't have purchased any extra and just went with the 2 they gave me when I purchased the cosleeper.The material is average, nothing special.  It holds up well to lots of washes and uses.	3
In 1982, it seemed as if the new supergroup Asia would be the great white hope of AOR fans. Most of the 70's supergroups had either disbanded or faded into obscurity, and Asia looked to be the heirs of the format and the band that would continue the glories of FM rock into the 80's. Alas, after this first LP, Asia descended into mediocrity, turning out many more albums, none of which equalled this outstanding debut. This record is a document of What Might Have Been, simply put. Well worth owning, and a fitting coda to the great rock albums of the 70's.	9
I bought this item for my niece's birthday and she loves it! She's seven and I think just the right age to start with this item. It is such a great and fun way to learn about money. How to give change, how to manage money,etc. We play &#34;store&#34; and put prices on the items right in the room we are in. It's fun!!!!It's Also good for a few years. Well made and very durable.It takes credit cards,Too!!!!	22
This is an acquired taste - you might not even like it at first. It is not vinegary like some of the WF products. I'd describe it as more robust, spicy enough for a guy who loves heat, and smoky. My wife isn't a fan, but she's not on a diet or willing to give it a chance. She doesn't like smoky food, either. I can say that after two or three meals it has grown on me and it is a staple as long as I'm on Atkins.	11
I had enjoyed this app for my phone and then a few days ago it was unfunctional for some reason. I erased it and installed a newer version and it's fine again. I was a bit concerned as I had read from several reviewers that it didn't work on &#34;older&#34; androids. It is fine for my Samsung Galaxy 3. I enjoy the ability of reading in my fire at  home and yet have the ability to read when I'm out and have some free time. It sync's wonderfully and I'm very pleased with it.	1
it was a quick read and did not have enough depth. liked the idea of some f the punishments, but it was rushed. and some arts were confusing. I should retread a section of a story for one reason only, it was hot and had to read it again because... wow! um, read some lines again because it was kind of confusing. but like I said, liked the idea though. will read their work again, I liked their writing style, next time more to the story. that magic stuff was unneeded fluff or nt fluff enough.	14
"These jeans are B17,s.  The description states they fit at the natural waist.  Not so, check Carhartt's web site and B17's are described as fitting slightly below the waist line.  Plus, the waist size runs way small.  I ordered 35"" waist and the waist was more like 32"" or 33"". Had to return.  However, Carhartt B13 does fit at the natural waist.  I am a Carhartt fan.  I wear B151's everyday to school and they work great. Sometimes sizes may run a little inconsistent."	8
"This is a great toy until you open the box and try to put it together. The tracks are difficult to put together and then stay together. They come apart when played with. It took me a long while to finally get the whole track together. Then a couple seconds into playing with it, it is apart again.I recommend if you want a Terrific train set get the GEOTRAX sets. They are easy durable and lots of fun to look and play with. Also anyone including your child can rearrange the tracks with easy. DON""T GET THIS ONE>>>>>>>>>>>"	22
For years, I have had a plastic stapler at home for the occasional needs that come up.  It was cheaply made, and often I had to re-staple something if it had multiple pages.  When using it, it just felt like it could fall apart at any time.  This Swingline is different.  I have never once had to re-staple something.  Pick it up and it has a firm, solid feel in your hand.  It's well-built, strong enough to last many years.	17
These jeans are awesome.  I see that there are a lot of negative reviews about how Levi's changed the fit of these jeans (however long ago...), but I wasn't wearing them back then so I cannot speak to that issue.  But from what I can tell there shouldn't be any complaints about fit!  These jeans look great and fit well.  They are also high quality.  What else could you want?  Them to come with money in the pockets?  Well me too but that goes for everything I buy.  Get a pair, you won't regret it!	8
was tipped to this app by an Apple employee. Thanks! I needed a radio streaming app to get away from massive commercials and wimpy programming. TuneIn finds worldwide radio stations. Sometimes there are buffering issues. You can search by genre, etc. I had major buffering issues with an Itunes radio station - Venice Classical radio.  ( my favourite - just fine music, no commercials or rude interruptions like &#34;subscribe now!&#34; )Tunein has replaced Itunes Radio for this purpose. Very user friendly, many choices and a good alternative to Pandora as well.	1
I am a big godzilla fan and I saw this movie as a kid. It's about a huge, three headed monster coming to destroy earth. And it's up to baby Mothra to convince godzilla and rodan to stop fighting each other and join mothra to defeat the 3 headed monster that the earth phrophecies said would arrive to destroy the earth. I liked this movie!  It's a lot of fun to see Godzilla,rodan and mothra baby  team up to defeat it. If you are a godzilla or monster movie fan give this movie a try.much recommended!	15
"Borrowing a term Maddox once used, this album is an aural holocaust. The reason to buy this is to laugh at how terrible it is. While other more musically talented men avoided the problems of turning such classic rock songs as ""Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds"" into spoken word, Shatner attacked them...and then failed miserably. Surprisingly his music is possibly even more overdramatized than his acting and has unnatural melody-killing pauses for effect embedded throughout each song. It prevents casual listening or just enjoyable listening other than for comedic purposes."	6
After trying this product once, my husband noticed a difference in how his hair turned out after styling. He told me to buy this product again and now it is a favorite.This product is guaranteed to add at least 10% fullness to your hair after the first application.It has mild botanical cleansing agents and fruit acids. It not only cleanses your hair, it helps to purify your scalp. Polysorbates free your scalp of excess cellular debris which can block hair follicles.He doesn't use the conditioner, but I love usingit with this product.~The Rebecca Review	4
It's a shame THQ didn't allow AKI to develop there games for the PS2 as well; the ridiculous system Yukes developed for &quot;Smackdown!&quot; makes me feel like I'm playing Mortal Kombat instead of wrestling.  The AKI system provides the best wrestling simulation of all games.  The movement is accurate and believable, and the reaction the characters have after hurting a particular body part makes for a good wrestling experience.  I also particularly like the fact that there is no &quot;health bar&quot; on the AKI games.  This gives the game more of a &quot;give and take&quot; feel.	23
If your worried about this thing fitting STOP !! This fitting fits inside the standard 4&quot; collection hose no problem.As for the reduction end it's also true and mated with my shop vac hose just fine. Here's a little helpful hint.If your having problems with fittings or your dust collection hose has a weird tweek in it and wont fit up under your machine like you want.Use a heat gun or a hair drier to slowely heat up the hose and then position it however you need to. Now get out there and collect some dust.	21
I bought this 5 years ago for my husband. It is still holding up well and going strong.There are so many compartments to store all of your tools and gadgets and supplies. We have bought several different Bucket Boss Organizers and they all have been very well made and stand up to abuse.Definitely makes the tool buckets more useful and keeps things organized. It also looks more attractive than a bare bucket with all the supplies just tossed in. You don't have to dig through to find what you need anymore - everything is readily available in the organizer.Highly recommended.	21
When I first saw the trailer to this film, I honestly wasn't impressed. It just looked like another pointless teen film (like &quot;She's All That&quot;). When I rented this film I wasn't expecting much. And when I watched it for my first time, I didn't get much. HOWEVER.. when I watched it again (a day later), I realized that this really is a great film. So what I'm saying here is, be optimistic about this film, or you may not enjoy it.Anyway.. in my opinion, this is a great teen flick!	6
Others have written about poor manuals and shoddy components.  This might be true.  I'm not a beginner with network software or hardware but I'm hardly a pro either.  I had zero problems installing this (manual seemed  fine to me) and haven't had any problems using it since.  BTW I use it to  hook into my DSL connection.  If it didn't work I'd just send it back  (Amazon's always been great about this).  And the price is just too hard to  pass up.	10
I purchased this game after watching it played on Tabletop on the Geek and Sundry youtube channel.  It can be a little daunting when you first set it up but is easier to play than it looks. I really like that it supports up to 8 players as we have a large group of friends that game together. It can be hard to find good quality games that support more than 4-6 players and many of the ones that do can become tedious waiting for your turn.On our first time playing we got our butts kicked, but we still had a great time.	22
I would say this book is a decent read.  Not stellar, but not trashy or annoying.  It is probably the best book in the series that I've read so far.  I'd say that while these have thusfar been entertaining (taking up time and diverting my mind), there really just doesn't seem to be too much going on.  At least this one had a bit of action.  Story was weak, and characters were somewhat predictable.  But not a bad read for &lt;$3.	14
Stevie Wonder's meditations on inner city life and the African-American push towards middle-class stability in the wake of the '60s civil rights movement made for some pretty great music... This disc had its share of radio hits and anthemic ballads, such as &quot;Living For The City,&quot; &quot;Golden Lady,&quot; and &quot;Don't You Worry 'Bout A Thing,&quot; but it also has some curious sleeper tunes as well, such as &quot;Misstra Know It All,&quot; which is one of my favorite Stevie Wonder songs.  Oh, yeah, &quot;Higher Ground&quot; is also an amazing funk classic... As is this whole album!	9
"Ok, alot of people hate this game - but i cant complain with it.Although some of the levels are annoying (i hate the 2nd level of india with a passion) at least it held mostly to the name of Tomb raider (the 2nd, and 4th onwards) should be named ""City Raider"" the graphics are kinda yellowish. the lighting can be harsh. but its a lengthy game - took me almost 6months to beat (partially cause i jumped triliogy installments)but its an ok game. its better than the 2nd, and way better than all the others afterwards - but doesnt messure up to the original."	23
After hemming and hawwing and comparing and studying, I decided to go for it.  There are a lot of choices online at all kinds of prices. I bought the Strathwood 3 seat bench on a Friday morning and Fedex delivered it to me within 22 hours, on a Saturday and at a $10.00 shipping charge.Assembly was simple for the two of us:  15 minutes and no tools required.  The finished product is attractive, comfortable, and quite sturdy.  What a perfect purchase!  Thank you Amazon, as usual.	18
A 70's favorite of ours.  Lots of funny characters who go to church together and attempt to oust the gambling element in their town with the help of their new pastor.  Chase scenes will give you a good laugh.  Hilarious finale involves an all out demolition derby between church ladies and the bad guys with the expected happy ending in spite of broken nails and wrecked cars.  This was in an era when churches were just beginning to loosen up with their music and may seem corny in some ways, but still a lot of fun.	15
"This first season had a handful of strong episodes.  Intriguing premise, though you get the feeling the momentum can't be maintained long-term.  There's a LOT of cat-and-mouse, which can get old if you binge-watch, but it's very well-made and scripted.The only thing missing is the ""wow"" factor, making it not all that memorable.  But if you love sci-fi and are looking for something to follow, I'd definitely recommend a watch.  It may have only lasted two seasons, but I watched every single episode as it broadcast, and was disappointed when it wasn't renewed."	0
I am very happy with this deck box. It is very roomy. I keep all my garden supplies there. It was very easy to install, just 5 min, snap all the parts and it is ready to use. It is sturdy too. We sit on it and it holds me, my husband and my 3 years old with no problems. I actually store there some vegetables and fruits, like potato and apples, when I do not have room in refrigerator and I know that animals won't get it. It nicely blends with my white walls of the house.	18
For the most part, I like certain kinds of yogurt, but I find that I just can't eat it every day.  I don't like it THAT much.  But I do want to take steps to keep my digestive system on track, and these small, sweet acidophilus chews are a great way to do just that.  I actually take one every day, even if I do eat yogurt.  Plus, the price cannot be beat.  It's always great to be able to consume things that are good for you without totally breaking the bank.	12
With my washing machine not working, I've been doing a lot of hand laundering, as well as washing dishes. (no dish washer either) My hands with dry Winter air and harsh indoor heating have become crinkled, cracked and rough.I have a box of hand lotiona and creams and last evening applied this one just before going to bed.It helped very much.Upon awakening this morning, I nearly forgot how dry and parched they had been because they feel so nice and soft.I'll be using this every night before bed until my skin heals.Wonderful product for chapped, cracked hands.	12
This is a wonderful series, which is a real treat on DVD.  The series itself is very nicely balanced.  Suitable for all ages, with plenty to keep the young folk interested as well as adults. Beautiful graphics throughout and relevant commentary compliment the solid foundation of facts about the solar system.  The DVD features make navigation to your favourite episodes or scenes simple. It's great to have such an educational DVD in my collection that is so professionally put together and it's one that I return to often.  Right up there with &quot;Walking with Dinosaurs&quot; as my co-favourite 'special interest' DVD.  Terrific.	15
I like how it just barely sticks out from the cigarette plug on my Passat, so I can close the cover when I don't have my phone chord plugged in.Even on the 2.1 port, the charger cannot keep up with an iphone 5S. With every thing off on the iphone (air plane mode, screen off, etc), it gave a 15% charge in 2 hours. That's 7.5% per hour.When using Waze GPS the charge drops from 100% to 90% in 10 minutes.I would not recommend this charger.	7
Carhartt makes some of the best quality clothing for men, which generally is considered &#34;work-wear&#34;.  By far one of the leaders in this area. In this case the t-shirt is well made and fits appropriately. This is not some fashion fitting item, its a product designed to fit but to allow freedom of movement and comfort. You can't go wrong buying this if you are looking for tough, comfortable and well made clothing for work/leisure/ or whatever. I always look to Carhartt for tough well made clothes that are # 1 in quality.	8
I ordered this bra per the product guidelines..I am very large busted, and I thought this would be a good nursing bra--for not having wires.The only thing this bra is good for is for holding nursing pads in overnight.  There's no support--none.  I can't even imagine it would support me if I was smaller, either.  The fabric is fairly decent, but I am surprised at the positive reviews from the larger busted lady reviews on here.  I recommend the Goddess bra, or glamourmom nursing tanks--this bra was seriously a joke!	8
"I was hooked from the very first page.  I had no idea what was going on and had to keep reading to find out what was happening.  Isn't that the point of a good read?  I wish that the storyline had been expanded more especially regarding the lead-up to the sting as well as the separation period.  The idea that Alex was beginning to accept his sexuality change was covered pretty well as well as the point of Shaun being in love with him for so long and finally had a chance to ""show"" him.  I still thoroughly enjoyed the story very much."	14
This book keeps my 2-year-old entertained for a decent amount of time, and I like that it's washable.  It has a good number/variety of activities in it, especially as compared to other similar types of books.There are some activities for babies, but I think toddlers/pre-schoolers will get the most use out of it.  My daughter has a hard time getting the snaps on/off (they require a little extra &#34;elbow grease&#34; and/or for you to hold down the fabric on the page).  There are also some &#34;older&#34; activities, like the clock, or tying a shoe.Overall, good purchase.	3
This cable works for me in the tuner out jack of my amp. I noticed how thin the cable is, but the length is good for my needs. I  have played through the cable once and found it sub par compared to my other cables, which are professional grade and cost a lot more, but this is a cheap cable and sounds like any other cable of this caliber. I use the right angle to hook up to my jazz  bass during rehearsal where long cables at times bunch up and become cumbersome in a studio setting.	16
I'm appalled at the level of ignorance and vitriol in these reviews. How can this app steal contact data when it doesn't have network permission? Access to contact data is required to add birthdays, anniversaries, or appointments. It's a shame that ignorance and anger is leading to fewer developers submitting good apps for FAotD. Amazon app reviews are rife with ignorant trolls who have inflated egos, an unwarranted sense of entitlement, and who aren't half as smart as their smart-phones.This app works great for its intended purpose. It's a handy adjunct to my Google Calendar.	1
Yes, this movie is a classic. I feel very lucky to have grown up when the Ninja Turtles first became popular. This was back at a time when thought and care went into children's entertainment. Unlike the stuff kids are watching today. All of the characters in the Ninja Turtles series have distinct personalities and they're all lovable in their own way. If you loved this movie when you were a kid you'll still love it as an adult. Sure, the movie looks dated but it is far superior to the recent kids movies out there like &quot;Power Rangers.&quot;	6
"Hohner Marine Band, Hohner Special 20 and Lee Oskar Major Diatonic harps fit well in this case. Hohner's Big River Harp does NOT fit properly in the case - it is longer than the others, and doesn't snug in.  I'll either return the case or order two Lee Oskars to replace my two Big River models. Or, I can just deal with the fact that they don't fit quite properly, but probably ""good enough"". Decisions, decisions.Haven't played the toy harps yet, first things first. I bought the case for the case, not for the included harps."	16
Used once and really like it. I smoked whole chicken, but I cut chicken in half and smoked about 1.5 hours on lower heat. The chips birned, so next time I would add more chips. I did have to finish chicket (to add some crispiness) in the oven for 10 min. The chicken came out excellent, best chicken I ever cooked. With chicken smoked potato and came out very nice as well with delicate flavor of smoke. Also, I considered as a bonus the aroma of smoked wood that fill out my house, loved it. It was not strong, but flavorful. Highly recommend this product.	18
I purchased this headset to use with my cell phone.  As it turns out I use it with my computer and love them.  They  are easy to use, long battery lfe and sound great.  They may be a bit uncomfortable or odd because of the back of the head design but all headphones have some kind of pressure due to the design.  The only time I notice their presure is when I wear them for a few hours.  Short term no problems.  By the way, I wear glasses so that may be the culprit.I'd buy them again.	7
There are three eseential Nick Drake albums:Five Leaves Leftwith its chamber folk,Bryter Layterwith its huge arrangements. and Pink Moon.Pink Moon is bassically Drake on solo accustic guitar. But Drake was no strummer. His complex composing and full guitar playing--he could strum, pick, and almost orchestrate with a simple accustic--make these full songs, rich in sound like jazz classical minitures.The sad Drake alone is a whisful, poiniant experiance, and listening to the beatiful music on Pink Moon is a trip like few others--queiting and disquieting, sad and comforting.Essential	9
While automation and mass production have taken over the manufacturing sector of many industrialized nations, it's eye opening to watch how things are made. Whether big or small, delicate or delicious, high art or high speed, pick a season of this series and watch and be amazed. It's fascinating to watch how some of the most common things we see are made. After watching, however, the one thing I really want to know is how did someone come up with the ideas for the machines that make the machines?	0
I had this item in my wish list forever and I'm so glad I finally bought it.I use the buff puff with a good facial cleaner in the shower and wow - it exfoliates more effectively that anything else I've tried, and I've tried it all. I really feel like my serums and moisturizers are able to penetrate after using the buff puff instead of sitting on top of my skin. For the first few uses, I suggest using a very light hand, as it can be a little harsh.	4
This notebook has 100 pages - enough for about a month of calculus notes.  I number them and label the cover with start and end dates.  Very convenient and the paper quality is great.  Blue lines are crisp and each page has 'Neat Sheet perforations&#34; so if you have to tear out and hand in some pages, they don't have paper strings along the side.The notebook I received has front and back covers with coated kraft paper - not the hard plastic that I've seen in the past....	17
great crib, easy to assemble (it was pretty much assembled when it arrived!) My 6 month old son who is almost 20 pounds fits well in it, but I had to double wrap a bumper pad around it so he wouldn't roll into the cold metal! I am not sure how long he will fit into it, but I love its portability and how I feel there is no rush to move my happy 2 yr old out of his crib. And its overall best feature is how you can roll it from room to room without taking it apart.	3
Sammy Hagar's been entertaining me since his &#34;Bad Motor Scooter&#34; days with Ronnie Montrose. Here he joins again with friends Joe Satriani, Michael Anthony and Chad Smith to produce a very current record. As a longtime fan, I'm not about to say I turned it up to ear-bleeding levels. But I could. The tunes rock consistently, and there aren't any flat spots. The music created by these veterans shows that they are truly monsters of rock and roll. And they're creative. Still. Master craftsmen.	6
I needed a self powered USB 2 hub for my iMAC, and selected the CyberPower.It works as advertised and comes with its own plug-in power supply.  I can leave my Palm TX hooked to it even when the computer is off and it will charge it.  The only drawback is that the thing is loaded with eight LED's and they stay on whenever it's powered either by the computer or by its own power source.  If you have the thing in your sleeping area and are light sensitive, you'd have to unplug it.	7
What a great book!  I picked it up at my library after hearing it suggested at my book club.  I didn't want the story to end, but I wanted it to end because it was just so powerful and moving.  By the end I was crying from shock, grief, and sheer happiness.  The author took a subject that I've never thought about and gave it so much life.  I want to know more about circus trains and old time circus shows.  Read it!	5
I installed this in a Super Champ x2.  As others have pointed out you'll have to turn the treble down after installing it.  That's because it's designed for making solos stand out. I.e., for adding punch.  If you're a lead guitarist, this speaker will make your guitar sing.However, if you mostly play rhythm, I'd stick with the stock speaker.I want to put two of these into my 4x10 Blues DeVille to increase its range and make solos sing, while letting the stock speakers give me some bottom.	16
I was impressed when I felt how heavy this connector is.  I was worried when I couldn't get the on/off valves to budge.  They wouldn't move at all.  Before I gave up and sent it back, I got out a pair of pliers.  Success!  After they had been turned once using the pliers, I could then turn them by hand.  I like the grip that helps you to attach the connector to the faucet so the switches can stay facing out.  The fit was tight and there was no leaking.  I anticipate this connector will last for a very long time.	18
I've had this Plate Joiner for about 5 years. When I first got it, I thought it was great. It made slots that I could put biscuits in and join stuff. However, the first time I used it to make a critical joint, the major shortcoming showed up. The slots are not parallel to the base. They are a little more parallel when using the fence, but I prefer using the base indexing method.Also, as many other reviewers have noted, the chip ejection chute gets clogged very easily, making it difficult to work cleanly.	21
I had to write this. I am a huge e-40 fan since 1993. After listening to all his cds. This is the best. Its his best beats and most creavtive lyrics and styles on this cd. I love the songs sprinkle me,dusted and Disgusted with 2pac, and one love. He made videos for all of those. This came out in 96 and he was just starting to make a national name for himself. He never matched this masterpeice.He still never really gets airplay he deserves. But get this cd.	9
This is a great movie that sets the classic tale of A Christmas Carol in a very American setting.  Set in the time of the Great Depression the character of Scrooge played by Henry Winkler is perfect for this. The heartwarming change of his character, although well known by most, is given such a unique spin that this should become a classic in its own right. The attention to detail by the costuming and sets are wonderful and the makeup staff did an amazing job at aging the young Henry Winkler. You will not regret watching this new twist on the classic tale.	15
This is as good as advertised for a car and I've used it for that and will keep it in the car.  But for me the good news is the threads in the snow brum head and handle are the same as with household poles for extending roller brushes or attaching mops.  I really wanted the snow brum to clear the snow off a large hot tub cover and was able to quickly attach the heat to a 10' extension pole.  The handle that comes with it won't quite reach all the way across the cover.	18
Just another rip-off as it does nothing good at all. I used it faithfully for weeks, both with a night cream as well, and take two showers or baths per day to keep everything clean and moisturized. I think people that say it works well, are those that see what they WANT to SEE and nothing more. The tiny, tiny little bit of good that happens if any, is the same that can be accomplished with any moisturizer, and not the expensive stuff that delivers nothing THE ONLY THING THAT DISAPPEARS HERE IS OUR CASH AND NOTHING MORE.	4
After using Nielsen Massey's Pure Vanilla Extract I would never be able to go back to using cheap artificial vanilla. There is just such a flavor difference. In fact friends ask me to put double the vanilla in my baked goods because they crave the flavor. I use this in banana bread, chocolate chip cookies, custards and ice cream. Basically anything that calls for vanilla is better with this more expensive brand. In fact, I don't want to run out of it so I currently have four bottles. I guess I can't live without it.~The Rebecca Review	11
I've compared these ear buds to Shure e2c's, ($50-60), and Creative Zen Auravana's, ($60-100), and found them better than the Shure's and almost as good as the Auravana's in certain ways, and better in other ways, (the bass on the Auravana's is too thumping, and cable noise is worse than the Koss).  They're just plain astounding - especially for the money.  If you want to buy something that beats all three, get the Creative EP-830's.  Incredible sound that just barely beats these little Koss buds - but they're $50.  For the money, the Koss can't be beat, period.	10
There is no perfect solution to window blind cords, but I think these do well. I actually used this kind years ago for pets. I do usually have to open and close them to unwind, but that is okay. What is important is that they put the cord high above a child's reach. I just ordered many more for the rest of the windows. However, for the kid's room we have the kind that is screwed into to the wall and wraps the cord around, so there is no chance of these plastic parts falling.	3
It's Dickies...you get what you pay for and that's good rugged quality fabric. It's made for a working man, from painting your shed to getting on the ground and changing your oil...they fit as expected...the Demi is thick and fits good. The pockets were a little high on the back for my taste and that's the only reason why I didn't  give it a 5 star rating, but nonetheless I like them a lot worth ever penny I spent....and my wife says and I quote &#34;they look good of your butt honey&#34;  Ha!	8
If you want a great tasting snack that is relatively healthy, I would highly recommend this product.  But beware, once you have eaten one, you will want more.  I leave a bowl of these chips on our kitchen island and we are constantly walking past the bowl grabbing one or two on our way to do chores.  They are slightly sweet.but the sweetness does not overpower the banana flavor.  I plan to order 2 more cans to store so that we can be sure we won't run out.  I will definitely reorder when we open the last can.	11
We did when we bought all those Mariah albums.  I think we deserve better when it comes to Mariah performances on Dvd.  I mean they still haven't released The First Vision on dvd yet I don't think they ever will.  This concert has so much bad editing.  Let her sing one song all the way through at least once.  The only reason I gave this dvd five stars is because of the exclusive music videos.  The Roof and Breakdown are classic.  Swimming with the dolphins was also very cute.	6
Dario Argento did it again.Perfect film as only he can make.In Phenomena beauty meets darkness,gothic atmosphere meets bloody murders/not much,but it doesnt matter here/,and this all,as always,is presented with &quot;living camera&quot; and finest direction.We dont running anywhere,the atmosphere is slow,you can taste the beauty of Switzerland,thinking about the story.Fans of Italian horror wont be dissapointed,they get giallo and supernatural film in one.Always when you finished watching this film,the feelings that you got will not dissapear soon.	15
CAUTION:  To get an entire product usable on your device you are likely to have to deal with TWO, maybe MORE, separate vendors, shipments, multiple shipping charges, and hard to find specs on what tip fits what Exactly which devices.  NO ONE cares enough to really help you out.  Returns of some part(s) are likely, and add more to cost and to your wait for a fully functional product.  It is NOT the product, it is the AMAZON and SUB-VENDOR system that creates a mess.I would avoid this product like poison!	7
I have ceramic tile floors, which means grout.  This machine doesn't clean the grout at all.  A neighbor has a newer model with a special attachment for grout that she says works pretty good.  So I tried finding this attachment on their website, hoping it would work on my older model, but no luck.  So now I'm really disappointed knowing there is a better model out there, but I've already invested in this one. That being said, I still prefer using it to doing it the old-fashioned way.	12
Especially with cherry and grape sized tomatoes. Amazing production, it's out of the way, well-engineered, they even include a nice big metal hook to hang it with! The plastic-fabric sides WILL disintegrate in a couple-three years, so don't expect this to be a lifetime purchase. But it works great, you'll have more tomatoes than you'll know what to do with! I ordered two of these to replace the single one I had bought a couple years ago. Very clever idea, highly recommended! HINT: don't use cheap potting soil!	18
This is the second Wind Machine that I've owned, our first one just stopped working after almost 10 years.  We use ours almost exclusively in our very large master bedroom on the high setting (we like the sound and the breeze).  Others mentioned that it's not all that powerful, but we find it plenty strong for indoor/casual use.  It's not an industrial shop fan by any means, but it's great for cooling a large room, painted walls, even outside on a deck.  It's very light for it's size and the tilting feature is nice.	13
This hose nozzle lets out an amazing amount of water and looks like it could survive a nuclear blast.  I'm extremely impressed with the build quality and the functionality for washing dogs and my car.With my old nozzle, it would take a long time to wash the soap out of my dog's hair.  With this nozzle, the initial gush of water takes almost all of the soap away leaving them squeaky clean.  Same goes for rinsing soap off of my car.It's hard to imagine being excited about a hose nozzle but this thing is awesome.	2
This is a semi-transparent tape with glass fibers embedded which give it super strength. I use it when repackaging where staples were used before. At first I doubted it's sticking strength because it just doesn't feel as sticky as many others but in actual use it does seem to really adhere well. I highly recommend it in packing situations where strength is required such as on heavy boxes. Using to seal packages in lighter weight situations would be overkill. It's too expensive for that but well worth the price when you have the need for extra strength.	17
"I have used it, abused it, and it keeps on going. I have a long rigid pipe for my main line on my dust collector, and use the hose for ""drops"" to tools. I also use a long section of the hose for a ""shop vac type"" application, dragging the hose around the shop and vacuuming in corners, tight spots, etc... This hose is very flexible, and tough. I recently purchased a second hose for use in my shop, and if I need it later down the road, I will buy a third."	21
This is the one game that, by now, every Dreamcast owner already has. And deservedly so; it's easy to pick up and it's blindingly fast. Problem is, it's so fast, you'll blow right through it in a few hours. It's too bad Sega felt the need to tack on the other characters. All the non-Sonic levels are boring (especially the big cat levels where you fish). Then there's the terrible music. I recommend muting your TV and playing your own music on a CD player because the in-game music just doesn't work at all. Or you could listen to it for a good laugh.	23
Having used several different types of salad spinners over the years, I have to say that this is the best one yet. Just push the plunger and let it spin away. You can do other things while it works, as you don't have to hang on to it. A real time saver in the kitchen.The small one will spin enough lettuce for 1 - 2 salads, so if you have a big family you would most likely want the large one.It really is a one hand operation, all the other required two hands to use.	13
I'm shocked by all of the other reviews on this particular product.  Many complain that it's too small for their sink...hello!!!  It wasn't made for a SINK.  Anyway,...I love this tub.  I wouldn't want any other one.  It was the most convenient when my son needed to be on the sling =perfect=, and now that he's sitting up,... it's even more convenient.  Please ignore the negative reviews and I highly consider buying this product.  It may be the only tub you will buy in you child' early stages.	3
I actually first learned about Barry's tea in a novel I was reading. It piqued my interest enough to try it, but it wasn't available at our local supermarkets, so I ordered a box from Amazon. I'm very pleased with the tea, it's a very robust but smooth, full-bodied black tea that I love to drink straight or with a few drops of lemon juice. I brew a couple of cups a day in a Mr. Coffee machine that I use only for tea, and it makes a great hot drink.	11
For 5$, these are definitely a good purchase. The shades came quickly, and though they weren't super high quality, they were nice for sure. They mirror nicely so that you can't see behind the shades from the outside, but please keep in mind this makes them a lot darker to see out of than normal sunglasses. The metal has a little bit of give to it so you can bend it a little, but the free pouch is really nice to protect the shades from scratches. Overall good purchase.	8
I love reading, and in a lot of cases I found myself leaving a book at home because I didn't want to carry any heavy things. This is great! I put in a small 512MB card and now it holds ~50 books! I gave it 4 stars only because the dictionary function isn't very good. I think it has a literal copy of a dictionary, which means it doesn't explain the word fully but still doesn't allow you to search for the meaning of a work in the translation window...	10
I've looked at Lie Nielson and Vertitas low angle block planes and concluded that I don't deserve such works of art. I'd be afraid I'd pick it up with glue or paint on my hands or drop it on the concrete floor (ouch). So, I bought the lowly Stanley low angle block plane. For what I do, it suits me. The fit and finish is a little rough but it works just fine and the price was right. Out of the package it was fairly sharp and it did an excellent job.	21
'The Secret of Grisly Manor' is one of those room-escape style games where instead of breaking out, you're breaking in and exploring. The puzzles and item usage is pretty standard for a game like this.I wouldn't say that the game is too short like some of the other reviews here, but I would say that once you've beaten it the first time, there's no point in replaying it because there aren't any puzzles that will take you long to beat again or any game mechanics you'll forget and have fun relearning.	1
Excellent read! Ms. Gruen masters character and plot with beautiful prose. I remained captivated and found myself caring for the diverse cast.  Ms. Gruen successfully evokes a sense of the times, the desperate nature of survival during the Depression, as well as one's attempt to salvage one's sense of self as age betrays the body.  The storyline is suspenseful, true to period, and woven through with a touch of romance.  The setting is gritty and evokes the reality of Circus life on the road and  the behind-the-scenes work required to attain the magical world the public craves.  Well done!	5
I've tried many types of chairs, sitting on my computer char, etc. but it was always awkward. This bench, with its thick padding and wide width allows me to practice playing the guitar and move around freely. Honestly, I even sat on the floor for a while, but no matter what I did my legs would hurt. I just wasn't at the right height. This bench is adjustable and I was able to find a height so that I could practice for hours without putting a strain on my legs and back. It was absolutely worth the small investment for me.	16
This is a great machine all around. What puts this ahead of other units is that you can pull up the DVD menu not only from the remote but also on the front of the unit. It even has a Jog-shuttle dial on the unit for Still, Pause and Frame advance which is very smooth. This unit even has a built-in 5.1 Dolby Digital Decoder for 5.1 Upgradable Receivers. You get a choice of Composite, S or Component video outputs. The remote works on all SONY TVs. Very, very good for the money.	10
I already own a Boresnake for the 9mm pistol and was completely sold on its performance. The 12 gauge versiondoes not disappoint at all.Keep in mind the Boresnake is not meant to replace a rod and barrel brush along witha reliable cleaner.I run it through the barrel 3 or 4 times then proceed with my regular cleaning routine(I follow itwith rod and brush with Mpro 7 and some Shooter's Choice).A must have for any cleaning kit.Best of all,once it gets excessivelysoiled, wash and reuse. Fabrics bag in the washer will get it done.Outstanding product.	20
Slightly limited, but a favorite with 6 and 9 year old boys. We started with all cards face up and playing for the same goal as in the directions. Eventually, have made the game more and more difficult as we continue to play...the game directions way to play are pretty simplistic. There are ways to adapt this to make it even more challenging so I look forward to the family growing into this and using with math for high numeric values (which is not in the directions, but possible). Funny cards...good stuff here.	22
This game is great! It's not as good as Myst, but it's still impressive. This games backs right up to Myst, so if you hann't played Myst, you will have NO idea on whats going on! Somthing thats better the Myst, the grapics. I don't know how good they are on PC because I've got the playstation virsion, but the graphics on that are awsome! My opinion on buying it or renting it is you should buy it if you've played and BEATEN Myst. But Bloskbuster donen't carry this game.	23
I read with interest many of the other reviews.  It seems everyone but myself has heard of this brand.  I have been using car leather conditioner bought at the parts store on my truck seats, a couch, and two recliners.The car conditioner worked ok but was expensive and harder to apply.This just floats on with a small cloth.........I put in on rather heavy since my leather had not been treated for over 6 months.The difference was amazing.  My leather returned to it's new look and after a week I see no evidence of the smooth leather glow going away.	2
I....LOVE.....THESE....BLADES.  Add these to any reciprocating saw, and suddenly you can do things with your saw you never could before.  I've used these blades to cut everything from bolts to pine stumps.  The length allows you to use your saw at angles and distances that you otherwise couldn't with the tiny blades that most saws come with.  If you don't have a set of these for your saw...you should.  You'll be amazed at what they can do.	21
I can confirm that this model here does NOT have the volume control in-line, thankfully.Edit:After owning these for several months, I put a pair through the wash.  They still worked but the foam died.  I bought another pair, and have concluded these are overall the best buds for the price.Edit #2:After ordering a second pair and using them for a bit, they too have given way and the expansive response of the foam no longer prevails amidst the sweat, etc.  Therefore I am off to buy my 3rd set.  For such a low price, I really could care less.	10
This was worth the price.  I liked that the characters knew and grew up with one another.  It was predictable in places.  I agree with another reviewer that the breast cancer bit was a bit glossed over and nothing was written much about that.  All that came out of the story was that chemo wrecked any fertility that Sukie may have had.  She would never give birth naturally.Eamon was lovely, and it was cute seeing him trying to work out and admit his feelings for Sukie.A lovely way to pass the time or read just before bed.	14
"The Lodge Logic L410 Sportsman grill is wonderful. I received this as a Father's Day gift and put it to work. 28 briquettes and cooked 4 1/3Lb burgers and 4 jumbo hotdogs to perfection. 1"" thick steaks cooked perfectly. Easy to assemble and clean.  Took a lightly oiled cloth to clean out any residual ash once it cooled. Stores nicely. I will mention it is heavy so be careful. It is cast iron and therefor weights a bit. Others have concerns about the tabs breaking off the door, but if you are moving it that much remove the door to move the grill."	18
Great game.  Really highlights the idea of simplicity and fun.  Sure there are more complicated board games around, but this one you can pick up in 30 minutes and teach to an 8 year old.  By the end of the hour, you will feel like you are racing to build your train route across the United States while competing with your opponent.  There's a reason this game is so good.  Children love it, Adults love and you will too. Not sure about all the others, but this is the one that started it all.	22
These labels are exactly what they say they are- truly blocking. We use them within our elementary school reading program. Finally, we have labels that allow for reuse of pocket portfolios without compromising the identity of its previous owner. Besides, no one wants to use a folder that has the shadow of a name behind your own!  These labels look good, save us money and time. At home, we use them when reusing shipping envelopes and boxes. My co-workers, husband, and students love them and you will too!	17
This is a very nicely built whisk, especially considering the price. The wires are bonded well to the handle, which is easy to grip and feels sturdy. The whisk performs well and is easy to clean. Nicely sized -- not too big, not too small. While you can spend a lot more for a more elegant or fancy looking tool, this gets the job done just as well, and appears built to last.I have a few other OXO kitchen tools and they have never let me down. This is no exception -- a great value, and highly recommended.	13
"I like the 10"" size.  It holds a substantial pot, whether you change the plant three times a year, or keep one perennial as I do.  The holder goes onto your deck rail in a few minutes.  While it is not heavy duty, it will hold even a tall pot easily and securely.  Holds enough soil for a second story deck like mine to trail a vine twenty feet, or a huge Swiss or trailing begonia.  Not much else to say except no problems and sturdy enough to last for years."	18
When my sister was in the hospital in ICU we wanted her to listen to music. We found Tunein on the Kindle . It came in clear and we witnessed a miracle. At the same time that she passed I'll Fly away came on which was the song she sang to our mother at her passing . My daughter and I had both said we would not be singing it to her because we don't sing well. You guessed it we all stood around her bed singing it. She must have been smiling.	1
Product works as advertised but  the run-down test on a new Lithium battery was a bit disappointing.  With frequent power outages, I want a light that will last a long time.  I turned around and purchased the LED bulb kit and resolved this as an issue.The provided bulb's brightness was mildly disappointing.  The LED is brighter but does not throw as wide a beam.But if you add the cost of the floodlight ($35) + LED kit ($25) , it's a bit pricey.	21
This game is so fun. Being a guy that used play D&D; back in the day but doesn't have the time to play a game that lasts 3+ hours, this is the perfect alternative. You can play with up to five friends or play alone controlling two characters since the monsters are controlled by cards that determine the attacks.It always is unpredictable due to the innovative random tile sets. You can also easily design your own adventures as well.Tons of replay, always action based, not to complex to learn and lots of fun!	22
Novellas are not my favorite but I like Annmarie, so I thought I'd try it and I loved it.Whly? I have a storyline, a plot, a h and H.I know why Aislinn has an issue with trusting men.I know what Kyle has on his mind and I know what happens.How could I not love it!  Great story, yes longer would have been better but, it wasn't just sex, I got a story - I'm happy!And I know that The Strength of Three is the follow-up book with her friend Christina's story, fantastic!	14
I love these for their support and comfort. I (sadly) just can't wear the tiny cutesy flip flops any more. But I don't care bcs I LOVE these. They do run small so order a size up. ln my opinion, this style has the best/cushy heal . Some others have a hard heal, which I do not recommend. My first pair has last 6 years and I wear them almost daily (I live in FL) and the tread on the bottom is still good but the front toe portion has separated. Worth the cost for sure.	8
This is a case in point about what was wrong with the 80's, my least favorite decade musically. In the 70's, you could trust a union of musicians of this magnitude to produce scorching, jaw dropping prog rock.  But in the 80's it only amounted to overproduced, manufactured for mass  consumption, calculated FM corporate rock. There is nothing prog about  Asia. Anyone who thinks this is prog needs to listen to these musicians in  their better days of glory with UK, Yes, ELP,King Crimson. My opinion on  this one will never change with time. File with GTR under 80's bad idea  supergroups.	9
This tub is bulky, but great.  It's like a real tub, and it does fit into a bath tub.  It is highly easy to keep clean.  And has two positions.  One is a reclining position for a younger infant.  In this position I would place a washcloth down before the baby to prevent sliding.  The second position is for infants to sit upright.  Great device.  Is something that could be used for years or passed to family and friends as a hand-me-down.  Well worth the price.  No mildew issues at all.	3
I love this mask. I have been using the expensive masks since I was early 20s. But this one is much better than the ones cost me over $80. My friends told me that I look younger than my younger sister now. hehe... I'm using it once a week, my skin tone is more even now and skin feels tighter too. I have been using the rose water as toner, they are great combination. Maybe the rose water is doing a good job too, I love them both.	4
Is it possible?  I love this character!  Maybe because of my childhood fascination with Nancy Drew and this is her come to life in the modern age, maybe because this is the chic I wish I were with the feisty and the smarts and the always getting her man (or lady criminal).  I don't know, all I can say is yes, thank you, more please!  Thrilled for the movie and I really hope we can get a new movie every couple of years, even made for TV.  Keep Veronica Mars alive!	0
I wanted this tea for the detoxification properties but was wary of what the taste would be like. I really despise licorice and was concerned that this may be overly strong due to all the herbs. This is a very sweet, very balanced and smooth tea. I'm not crazy about the taste but I can drink it every day with ease. The licorice is more of a sweetness than it is a flavor. It starts out a little peppery and is backed by strong sweetness and light floral notes. It tastes better warm than cold.	11
I like this sling a lot, and the quality is high but it's not as easy to adjust as they make it sound. I can make it longer with one hand but making it shorter takes two. Also, it would be nice if it was a little longer, and while they do give you instructions on how to lengthen it, it only adds about two inches. The attached swivels look well made and are easy to take on and off. Overall a nice sling, unless you're a big guy.	20
This isn't a well built Deck Box since it's so cheaply made of plastic.  On top of that, I had it shipped to the Volga region, which cost me about $[...].  I probably should have invested in something locally made out of wood or bricks, but I hadn't thought of that.  The purpose of it was to store old shoes given to me by the local shoemaker, but he went out of business.  Now I only use it to store dead rats that I have found on the countryside property.	18
In no means are these headphones studio quality. These are for the person on the go and no I don't mean running. The foam snuggles fits in the ear canal and does do a very good job a cancelling out noise. The base is okay, but you can always get a mini amp to create more bass or go into a devices settings to increase it. I did this on my IPhone 3GS and I was please with the results. Other than that it is a neat little accessory for my music taste.	10
This Milwaukee circular saw is among the best tools made.  The motor is strong and cuts through the hardest woods with relative ease.  It is well balanced and of moderate weight thanks to the alloy construction.  Fit and finish is suberb, as is the case with most Milwaukee products.  The case is sturdy and a plus if you move your saw frequently between jobs.  The Milwaukee gets 5 stars and is a credit to their line of quality power tools.  I'd buy another one without a second thought.	21
I like them - YES the KC is bigger now than it was on older models of the guards IT IS AS SHOWN IN THE PICTURE and  I LIKE IT.They provide some protection - not a lot  but they do look good.I actually saw another set of these today on a Toyota FJ and thought how good they looked on the black lights they had. Then I saw a CJ with the old style ( there were aged ) the KC was smaller and the guards were holding up well after the years of use it was obvious they had.	2
This was recommended by a guitar repair shop, and I have found it is a well rounded product that all guitar players should keep on hand.  It will polish, and lube things like Floyd Roses.  Do your strings get funky from the acid in your skin oil?  Wipe them down with a little DR. Duck's Ax wax before you place your guitar back in the case.  The secret is always use the least you can get away with.  Too much for polishing and you will be rubbing it off forever.	16
I expect a scrub brush to be designed for medium/heavy pressure.  The shape of the handle in my hand doesn't allow me to just press down and do the job.  Rather, the roundness of the handle wobbles back and forth (left to right versus back and forth) in my palm.  Also when wet the handle doesn't feel solid in my palm.  Maybe it's just the shape of my hand instead of a design flaw?  I only deducted one star for this possibility.The bristles are high quality and the plastic piece appears of the OXO quality you'd expect.	12
I HAVE NOW READ ALL OF THE BOOKS IN THIS SERIES. LOVED EVERYONE OF THEM. THE CHARACTERS ARE AMAZING. I HIGHLEY RECOMMEND THIS SERIES TO ANYONE WHO LOVES ROMANCE, ACTION, SECRETS, SEX, INTRIGUE. I HAVE EVEN PRE-ORDERED THE NEXT BOOK THAT IS DUE OUT IN AUGUST. I CAN'T WAIT. BIANCA D'ARC WRITING IS AMAZING. ONCE I GET THROUGH READING THIS SERIES. I AM GOING TO START READING HER OTHER BOOKS. IF THEY ARE HALF AS GOOD AS THIS SERIES. THEY WILL BE AWSOME. THANK YOU BIANCA FOR GIVING ME A WONDERFUL TIME READING YOUR BOOKS.	14
The material is hardier than I expected. Doesn't tear easily.The pockets already have the alphabet printed on them. I'd have preferred if they were all left blank. Although the makers tried to give more popular letters more space, it still seems that some letters need more. And what if you wanted to buy two? You'll find yourself scratching through many tabs with your sharpie.It holds a good deal of paper, but each pouch holds less than I hoped.It would also be better if it had a handle.	17
I bought this for my morphine juice pack, lost the adapter that came with. I turned out this fit better than my original one. But lacks in sound quality a little not by much like when you listen to some Bluetooth speaker. Seems little tight on female end, but no big deal. Make sure not to focus when you insert/pull. So far works well with iPhone earbud, beats studio, and my Audio Technica. Oh yeah delay respond on attached remote on both apple earbud and beat studio...\	7
I bought this cleanser for my husband. He was looking for something simple to help his complexion and he loves this stuff! I was sharing my own personal cleanser with him at first, but he didn't like that. I decided to try this for myself a couple of times. It doesn't foam, but it leaves your skin feeling squeaky clean. I also love the smell. With regular use, I have noticed a change in my husband's skin for sure. Good stuff! It looks smoother and brighter.	4
I live in the southwest and had pretty dry skin so my doctor recommended I try this stuff.  After about a week of use, once a day every day, I notice an obvious difference in my skin.  Areas that were dry and peeling aren't anymore and my skin is noticeably softer.  I ordered this size because I like lotions that have a pump, I find I used them more frequently and the bottle isn't as messy, and this one is no exception.  I would certainly recommend this product!	12
I bought this attachment for my angle grinder a few weeks ago. It was easy to attach, and works extremely well.  I made a free form bowl in no time flat. Not only does this remove stock extremely quickly, but it leaves the surface quite smooth, so very little additional sanding is required.  Just be sure to work safely: this is a chainsaw blade and it could be dangerous if you don't pay attention to what you are doing.  Other than that, this is a tool that gives provides almost instant gratification with very little learning curve required.	21
I don't tolerate caffeine well and I really miss my coffee and black tea.  Herbal teas didn't do it for me, but Rooibus Leaf Tea looks like coffee and comes as close to tasting like coffee as anything I've found.  I don't know if there's any scientific basis for this, but a cup before bedtime seems to make me sleep well.  This is one herbal tea I really like.  I recommended it to a friend who also had to give up coffee, and I recently included a box of Rooibus in a birthday gift ensemble for my favorite insomniac.	11
Bought this for my 2-year-old lab as she is a chewer.  She sniffed it and walked away.  I left it in her toy box and she picked it up once but only to move it out of the way to get at something else.  I don't think it has a smell that entices dogs to chew it as my 9-month-old, also a big chewer, hasn't touched it either.  I'm sure there are other dogs who love this but it was a waste of money for me.	19
Starting a compost pile has been on my list of things to do. I was unfamiliar with this product but after reading about it I was impressed.Although it'll take some time to determine if this stuff is a miracle worker, it has gotten me excited about using grass clippings, leaves, and other lawn debris to start a compost pile. The ingredients included in the easy-to-use box will hopefully 'heat up' the pile and get it into compost more quickly.I'll provide an update when I see evidence that it worked. Until then, though, it has gotten me started on composting.	18
This is probably one of the better dice rolling games out there. They have just enough mechanics in the game to change the random nature of dice into a not-quite-as-random set of parameters that make for an enjoyable game. this game has the unique feature of letting you have as many or as few players as you want to play, making it an easy pick up and play game.My only complaint is the game is not very balanced, some investigators are clearly better than others, and some cards are mind blowingly difficult to defeat due to the random nature of dice.	22
When I first looked at this I thought, &quot;How can it know the exact corner?&quot; But it does. When routing out a template guided area for example, leaving a rounded corner, you park this in the corner, one decent whack with the hammer, and to my surprise, a perfect corner. It is a very simple device. It's a 90 degree blade that slides along a very thin outer shell-guide.No more chisel-chisel-chisel, and difficulty getting the exact angles. It works as advertised. Saves a lot of time, and does a superb job. Highly recommended.	21
This game is one of the funest Game Boy Color games ever! 150 pokemon? Wow!!!!!!!!!!! That's alot! Who's cares about graphics in this game,it's still fun! The gameplay and sound is reat as well. If you love this game but want better graphics or more stuff to do,then buy FireRed or LeafGreen Version! They are just as fun! I'd reccomend trying at least one of the versions: Red,Blue,Yellow,Silver,Gold,Cristel,FireRed,LeafGreen or Emerald. Don't get Ruby and Saphire tohugh,they stink.	23
I bought this quite a while back. At first my dog didn't take to it, but it's now one of her old go-to toys. Why 2 stars? This thing gives  my dog an unfair advantage in the house. If we're playing 'chase', this is the only toy I can never get away from her because it hurts my hands to hold on to. She also leaves it in strategic locations as to cause the bare foot the most damage. Overall, it's a good toy for a dog and not a person.	19
I'm liking this little guy. I have tried so many keychain tools,..the Gerber Shard was my last experiment, but finally got tired of poking my leg when in the pocket, or jabbing my fingers when reaching into the pocket for it.  I'm not sure if I'll ever use the scissors, but they sure are sweet to play with! The blade is so tiny it's hard to call it a knife, but...so far it's sliced it's way into my heart, metaphorically speaking, of course, otherwise I'd probably be in ER instead of writing this review,..	20
I bought this game for my granddaughter on her birthday and I'm glad I did.  It is a simple game and easy for children to play.  The object is to get all four of your pegs around the board and home before anyone else.  Beware however! If someone lands on you back home you go.  This game helps children recognize numbers and teaches them to be a good sport.The dice popper can be a little difficult at times but other than that this is a great game to play together and have some fun with each other.	22
This is a great game because it's a simple concept (enough for young children to play) but still has a strategy component.Take too long in building a train, and someone else takes it, which ruins your entire game plan.Overall, it takes roughly 45-60 minutes to play, so this is a bit of a longer game.It's great construction and has held up well to a lot of use.  This is a game in our rotation that we play at least every few game nights.	22
"Pound for pound and dollar for dollar, this one of the best tools in my shop. Due to their popularity, it takes a while to find the router table, but it is worth the effort. I had to pay full list price.The packing is excellent and mine did not have a mark on it. The directions were complete and it was easy to assemble....nothing was missing.The fit,finish and the overall quality make this tool a ""must have"".Best of all it is Made in America."	21
"Anyone who hasn't seen the original isn't qualified to comment except, perhaps, as a mini-series. Nor is anyone who hasn't seen the sequel but only anticipating the quality of the original.""There are things you just can't do in life. You can't beat the phone company, you can't make a waiter see you until he's ready to see you, and you can't go home again."" Bill Bryson quotes (American Writer, b.1946)Until you've ""lived"" with the Bellamys and their staff for many seasons, you will have no idea."	15
This is very heavily built and well designed.  For a compact grill it reaches cooking temperature rapidly, and can hold 6 large burgers easily.  You can adjust the grill height to two positions. So far I've found the high position cooks best for my own style of cooking.  It's is easy to clean (set it on the grass and hose it out).  The bottom grating is showing signs of rust, so I've started using WD-40 on it after I rinse it out.  However, it is so stout that I don't know that the slight rust would cause a problem for some time.	18
This is one of the most ridiculous books I have ever read, all of the characters needed psychiatric help in my opinion. There is a very weak plot, that being that the women are related Mother and Daughters. The writing style has no finesse! The language used is often crude, in fact I can think of nothing to recommend this story at all. it's just about sex. The characters are all shallow, I disliked them all. The ending which is supposed to give us the HEA, is nonsense. I certainly will not be reading more from this author.	14
I love this guitar and one can not go wrong with a Yamaha, I currently have 3 acoustical Yamaha Guitars. The FG 700S is a full size dreadnought style steel string guitar. I usually do not like full size guitars as they do not fit in my lap well but this one is perfect for me and I can reach the full length of the neck with no problems. It has a deep tone and good volume. I give 5 stars to this guitar and recommend for the beginner as well as seasoned player.	16
"I was glad to find these jeans in a size 35 waist, since I had only seen Levi's in even-sized waist only. The color is a great stonewash hue, ideal for me. Two important differences compared to the 501's: ONE, the 505 has a zipper instead of metal buttons on the fly (a well-known feature); TWO, less known is that the rise in the 505's is lower than the 501's. The difference in the rise, in my pants is a 1 1/2"" lower rise in the 505's, something I am not used to."	8
I loved backgammon as a  young woman of the 80's, so I figured I'd download this and take a trip down memory lane.  Well, for the life of me, I couldn't remember how to play.  So the first stop was the help button and within a few minutes, it all came back  to me.  Whether I play the game with my husband or with the computer, it's a great way to  pass some time.  This game is easy on the eyes and the ads won't hinder your gameplay.	1
"Yes, these labels are just as they are described, but even better than I expected.From past experience with printing labels, I figured I'd have to spoil a few sheets to ""get the system zeroed-in.""I was wrong.  I clicked on my label options, selected the appropriate Avery label number, and voila! printed my first sheet of labels--which were perfect.As they advertise, the labels are also extremely easy to peel, so I'm very pleased and will reorder these labels again and again."	17
Smead has always been the go-to brand for hanging file folders, their quality is top notch and these colored folders are no exception. The bars are made from strong metal that doesnt flex like the cheap ones do, and the paper is thicker and doesnt tear like others do.These are bright and colorful, so it is easy to grab the file you are looking for without having to read the chicken scratch you wrote on the tabs.Recommended for people who want to simplify their file organization without being too drastic.	17
So for my upper lip and certain other areas, this product worked pretty well and didn't really irritate my skin. For the dense, curly hair around the chin, under the chin and more complicated curvy ares, not so much. It is messy, as others have said, but it cleans up with warm water which is nice. I am torn about the product because it works well in some areas and almost not at all in others. I don't think this will be a wax replacement for most, but those with fine hairs that grow a little long, maybe so.	12
The case feels good in your hands and it won't slip out of your hands. I've docked a couple of stars is that in the image, it looks like the buttons would be easy to press, however, that is not the case. The buttons are very flush with the case, which makes it hard to actually use the buttons. I literally have to sometimes use two hands to push a button. If only the buttons extended outward, this would be a good case. For now, I will keep this as a backup.	7
I chose this model based on the Amazon reviews and previous experience with a makita random orbital palm sander.  The other reviews do a great job listing the details, pros and cons.I had never used a plate joiner before but was up and running in 3 minutes.  I was doing a project with Ipe (aka Ironwood).  Ipe is one of the densest woods available and just kills regular blades.  I plowed through the project quickly. The motor didn't break a sweat and carbide cutters were begging for more.If you do any woodworking at all, just buy one.	21
It's so soothing to the insides of my nose. Some types of weather makes my nose very dry and the AYR helps a lot. When my nose get too dry it might bleed when I blow it but because of the AYR it doesn't bleed as often, The only thing is that you will need Q-tips to apply the AYR. You could use your fingers but I wouldn't. You never know what's under them, no matter how much you wash your hands. I would recommend this to any one with this problem.	12
I'm an Enya fan, to be sure, and this CD offers a nice  &quot;mix&quot;,(for lack of a better word) of styles. &quot;Pax  Deorum&quot; with it's chilling Latin refrains. &quot;La Sonadora&quot;  having a Spanish torreador ballad feeling, and the absolutely beautiful  refrains in &quot;Athair Ar Seamh&quot; display her vocal and writing  talents. And who can deny that &quot;China Roses&quot; is one of the most  smooth,sweet vocal pieces to grace a CD?? The Memory of Trees is a stellar  Enya disc!	6
I've used this App for many months on my original Droid and again on the Kindle Fire.  This is easily one of the best apps I've found in the Android Market.  Perhaps the most useful feature is the ability to view signal strength of all nearby access points on a nice chart listing all of the available channels, making it very easy to see when two or more access points are interfering with each other, and demonstrating which channels would be available for use to reduce such interference in the future.	1
I've found this shampoo in Mom's grocery stores, but they are almost always cheaper online.  It has a gentler formula than let's say selsun blue.  It also has a &#34;fresh&#34; smell.  It does not smell like tea or mint.  However, it is a little on the &#34;runny&#34; side for shampoo and may leave a little &#34;dustiness&#34; to your hair.  I'm not sure if it just makes my hair attract dust, if it's shampoo residue.  It's not noticeable unless you examine your hair under a microscope - which i do.	4
each time I give up on the high cost and feed my cats another brand, it takes less than 2 weeks to see the difference in their coats and weight.  They eat way more of the lesser brands and they poop 80% causing litter demand to double.  They eat much less on Science Diet.  I have a personal kitty rescue ranch, no help from anywhere so must watch every penny and cut corners  every way possible.  I find this to be the ultimate food...even if it smells bad.  :)	19
I've been grooming dogs for 35+ years & would never, ever be caught without Kool Lube!!  Great product, easy to use & is VERY HELPFUL!  It not only cools hot blades off, but removes hair quickly when you're in the middle of grooming a dog & don't want to take the blade off, take it apart to clean it!  Just spray Kool Lube along the top of the blade & thru the side, wipe off the excess & you're good to go!!  I love ALL Oster Products!	19
"Can openers just don't last forever.  I got this one after extensive research based on its high ratings by other reviewers, and based on the description of ""stainless-steel teeth bite into lids with the agility of a great white shark.""  How can you beat that?  Anyway, it is easy to use, it turns without any real wrist strength required and gets the job done.  I am sure that I will need another in a few years, but for the price, this one does the trick."	13
It is a Thanksgiving tradition in my house to watch &quot;Home Alone&quot; as the dinner is being prepared.  (My kitchen T.V. has a built in DVD player.)  We all recite together &quot;Take that, you filthy animal!&quot; I always cringe at the same parts where the robbers fall into Kevin's traps.  The next day, we watch &quot;Home Alone 2&quot; and relax. It's a lot of work preparing and cleaning up Thanksgiving dinner!These movies are considered holiday classics in our home.  (&quot;Home Alone 3&quot; isn't even worth considering.)  These two movies represent that rare combination of the sequel being just as good as the original.	15
I ordered the BD brand BBT and got this lavender colored Nexcare BBT model instead.  It's back lit which is quite nice in the dark in the morning.  I'm not sure it's all that accurate though -- sometimes I'll take my temp again right away to double check and it will be .2 to .3 off.  On my old BD brand which wasn't even a BBT, it was usually no more than .1 or .2 off if I redid it immediately.  The beeping is pretty quiet and doesn't bother me.	12
HAHAHA...LOL-OL-OL...there are 35 reviews of a $.84 bag of straps!, well i am the 36th time-well-spent reviewer LOL! Sorry people, and seriously, who cares to know if these straps can hall a 4x8 trailer (haha)... You have 10 tries and if all fail just buy another bag of them! I also am buying a bunch of tiny usb's as gifts for xmas and ran into these with comments, and spent 15 mins with it LOL! Merry xmas to all!	7
My mom suffers some age-related joint pain, and I had her try this herbal remedy.  It seemed to help, and just as significantly didn't seem to cause any side-effects or gastro issues for her (she's normally very sensitive to many medications).With this sort of remedy, it's hard to separate actual effects from the placebo effect, or from combinations of other hard-to-quantify variable such as the weather, activity levels, diet, etc, but it seems like it may help, and it doesn't hurt.	19
"This animated featured, directed by Don Bluth, is an unforgettable treat for the entire family.  It follows the adventures of ""Fievel,"" a little boy mouse who journeys from Russia to America with his family, late in the 19th century, to seek a new life free of cat persecution.  (Some analogies are present here.)  During the storm boat trip, Fievel is lost at sea, and he finally washes up ashore in New York Harbor, where he vows to find his family.With the voices of Dom DeLuise, Madeline Kahn, Nehemiah Persoff, and Christopher Plummer, this story will warm your heart.  A highly recommended movie!!!"	6
I went to best buy to replace the one that broke and they wanted I think like $20 or more for just a single USB version...I decided to check amazon on my phone first and found this dual one way cheaper here. My old one lasted a few years and I'm sure this one will too. I think my old one died because i had it loose in a bag and i think one of the parts may have been hit by something too. It works great though if you're looking for one!	7
I could hardly wait to be finished with this book. From the description it looked like it was going to be pretty decent...I was so wrong. The heat was minimal at best and made dom\sub relationships look corny and lame. It felt rushed and silly. Was hoping it would get better if I kept reading...wrong again. And then before I realized it...it was over. just like that. I had hoped that I could really get into this series but now I dont think I will be moving on to the second and third books. Glad it was free!	14
"The previews/lead up to ""The Event"" were interesting and I was looking forward to a riveting, well thought out and well acted new series. Not so. This series is boring, the dialog is boring and the acting is double boring. The writers are trying to create an edge of your seat build up moment, but it falls completely flat and left me with not even a warmed over feeling.So not worth it. I will be very surprised if this lasts for more than 1 season. Flash Forward was way better and wasn't on for more than a season."	0
This product has replaced my Proactive cleanser. It has 3.5% benzoyl peroxide, 1% more than proactive, so it really keeps your skin clear. CAn be used as a mask and cleanser. It is non irritating, and does not dry my face out. Dissolves oil too. I use the benzoyl peroxide moisturizer (step 3) from proactive. This is the only product that always works and does not irritate my skin, with exfoliants. I also use this with the Neutrogena Wave Duo, I rinse out the soap from the disposable pads and use it to deep clean my face.	4
Star Trek: Borg, like Klingon, doesn't really do much. You are a new Cadet who is assigned to a ship that is about to investigate the Borg. With the help of Q, you get to learn about your father and his battle with the Borg. All of this is very interesting, but there isn't much for you to do. Like the early game Dragons Lair, you just have to deside when to shoot, when to go left, when to go up, etc.  If you like Trek, this is an interesting collectors item. Otherwise, it would be wise to skip this game.	23
I bought this tub before my son was born, thinking it looked great and I could use it in the kitchen sink.  I do like that I can use it in the sink, but he's not a super long baby and his little feet always get stuck in the grooves where the tub folds!  It doesn't hold much water, either.  I wish I had read reviews before I bought it, because now, after only 2 months, I'm just going to replace it and throw it away.  What a waste!	3
This is the third review of an irish album I write today (the others were Cranberries) and now I'm sure about that Ireland is one of the countries producing the best music in the world. And not just commercial pop-music in the Spice Girls way. Okay, I just wanted to say something about Irish  music. Now let's say something about this album. It's great. it's  beautiful. Very good, easy listened music. If you like Enya or you just  want some easy-listened relaxing music. This is the album for you to buy!	6
Compared to today's standards, this little cartoon is a bit old-fashioned, although I wouldn't use primitive as one review suggested.  It's an oldie, for sure, dating back to 1968, and it used to be one of those films you saw every year.The story is great, and the little drummer boy has to suffer many things before he comes face to face with the Holy Family and the Christ child, and he learns that his gift - the drum - is equally treasured.A marvelous film!!!	15
Based on the reviews, I thought these pens would suit me, but I just don't like gel pens, despite their popularity.  They are too &#34;touchy&#34;; they leave unintentional marks due to their sensitivity.  I have also had problems with the ink running if it gets wet.  In addition, the marks can run through to the backside of the paper.  They do make a fine distinct line, however.  I gave my friend a few, and she LOVED them, so I gave her a few more.  I guess it all depends on taste.	17
I recently used one of these from a guy a few desks away from me.  Long story short, after 3 minutes of careful swipes (without water), my pocket knife is sharp enough to shave knuckles.  I wouldn't shave my face with it yet but I'm sure i could get it to that level if I took the time.The pictures currently don't show it but it collapses down to half the size.  The sharpening stone part pulls out and fits inside the handle.  I travel a lot so this is going in my suitcase.	20
Usually re-mixes bore the hell outta me and for the most part I don't see the point? If you have a good cd/song, why mess with it? Why take good songs and destroy them completely? Examples, Yes and Queen re-mixes come to mind just off the top of my head as really bad attempts at this. Anyway this is not the case here. Sure their are a few short comings, but for the just cranking it up at parties factor this cd rocks and the girl's a nice touch as well.Overall a decent attempt that deserves some notice.	9
I purchased this product!! I've tried many, many products in hopes something could help my nails grow, stop the tremendous peeling, and breakage right at my quick. This was my last resort and when reading the reviews I really thought to myself, whatever we'll see. I've never seen anything like. It's so amazing that I bought this very brand names polishes and my nails have never looked better!! No more acrylics!! YEEEAAAAH!! I am forever going to by this product and couldn't be happier. - Shelby, GA	4
although i had hoped to see the complete show as it happened, due to some legal mumbo jumbo they couldn't mess with the film release. that said, the remaster job is excellent! i don't know why people are complaining? this is still an awesome set, and lets face it, how much visual material of Zeppelin is out there...(more in the vaults i hope, for a possible release down the road)...i love this package, and the remastered cd set as well!!! 5 star all the way!	6
As with any &#34;frontier&#34; the American west had its share of opportunists, dreamers, hard working folks, bigger than life characters, and dangerous misfits.  The book explores lesser known outlaws and lawmen and takes away the layers of myth surrounding many well known characters like Jessee James and Billy the Kid.  Pat Garrett's life was interesting and his interview about tracking and killing Billy the Kid told it like it was.  For anybody with an interest in America's frontier days this is a great read.	14
i had been wanting to read these books, but was put off by the price.  when i saw the bundle, i jumped on it.  i could not be happier.  great read.  good character development and a slow, leisurely pace that kept you interested and eagerly turning the pages.  it has it all - suspense, humor, delightful characters and just the right amount of romance.  i recommed it to everyone and i am looking forward to the next adventure.  did i also mention that it is beautifully written?  because it definately is.	14
I have four dogs and so frontline is a must.  I always purchase from Amazon as the prices are almost half what my vet asks.  Free shipping, packaging is always good. Items are always as described and new in the pack. IMO, no other flea treatment on the market works as well as Frontline Plus.  Purchasing it in larger size is more cost effective.  I eye how much I put on my dogs and use it on my cats too.  Can treat 3-4 pets out of one dose.	19
Back in the day, moms all had pressure cookers and made beef stews and pot roasts in them. These cookers are being rediscovered and are making a big comeback as they're not just for stew any more. Hundreds of new recipes are appearing and Amazon has some really good pressure cooker cookbooks available. We recently bought this Presto 4 qt. size (just for 2 of us) but larger sizes are available. Mom was right, they are FAST, make delicious food and will impress guests. They're not expensive - give this a try, you won't be disappointed.	13
I played this game right after I finished Metal Gear Solid and while I was a little let down from the switch I found the game entertaining.  I played it at like 3 in the morning with the lights out and it can kinda freak you out.  It is an old game now but if you liked the Resident Evil series and never got to try this one pick it up for your PS1 or PS2.  Also if you are thinking about getting SH2 definately play this game cause it helps you understand the town.	23
This might be the worst shaving product I have ever used. Normally I like to used a badger brush + Tabac soap, but due to new living conditions I am unable to travel with those items. I bought this hoping for it to be better than most other commercial gels/creams, but I was wrong. I think I would take a can of that Barbasol foam before I used this again. Beard needs to be incredibly short for this filmy soap to work. If you wait for than a day in between shaves, much tugging and pulling will occur.STAY AWAY!	12
I picked this up a few days ago as another FAOTD (thank you, again, Amazon!).  I've always wanted to learn to play Backgammon, and though this app isn't really designed to &#34;teach&#34; it, it makes it very easy to learn.  The graphics are good, and the game play is quick.  There are several options that can affect the duration of a &#34;match.&#34;  You can have a quick one-game match, or you can play to 15 points, requiring several &#34;games.&#34;  After playing this, I'm ready to buy my first real Backgammon set (from Amazon, of course!).	1
"Fans of the ""with"" series should recognise the overall wold in this short story.  While this could be read as an unofficial prequel to the series, as these characters are mentioned briefly (though not by name) in Without Reservations, if you are unfamiliar with these novels I would read it after the first full novel.  I enjoyed this one and didn't find Laine irritating like some others did; not everyone can be perfect and it was a nice change from some other shorts I've read.  If you enjoy the series you'll probably like this addition to it as well, I did."	14
I purchased this charger to use with my Motorola Razr.  I already had one that is essentially identical, except my old phone (Motorola V5510 has a different sytle adapter than the Razr, which uses a 'mini-USB'.This product is inexpensive, does exactly what it says, which is charges the phone in a car using the auto's power/cigarette outlet, and it comes with a cute little Motorola 'M' insignia which lights up bloue during use.  At such a low price - I paid less than $9 on AMAZON - there's really no reason to buy a non-OEM charger.	7
I have two of these, and although each compartment is only partially filled, the lids pop open and spill the contents.  This happens much more often with this size, than with the regular size.  I have to tape the lids closed after each filling.The size is nice.  But you can see a gap between each lid and the bottom, so they let humidity in more than the regular size.I would prefer the kind with a single lid, and 9 compartments, each about the same size as these, but this is no longer available.	12
"This blade was purchased for the driver's side of the vehicle I installed it on.Installation was easy enough...with no thanks to the rather inscrutable instructions:""-Remove old wiper blade.-Install new wiper blade.""Hmm..ya think??On the day I installed this blade (and its 21"" passenger side companion) it was raining, so I got to test it immediately.This wiper makes good contact with the windshield, and cleans without streaks or chattering.Look: changing wiper blades isn't *that* hard. But surely Bosch can do better with the instructions it provides (which is why this is a four-star instead of a five-star rating)."	2
This product smells great. It has a coconut/beachy/light smell that fades so it is not overpowering at all. I wash my hair with shampoo and conditioner, then spray it on my dry hair and comb thru. It leaves my hair super soft and smooth. I even used it a day after washing my hair when I woke in the morning to smooth out bed head. It does not leave your hair greasy or weighed down at all. Not sure how that is possible but I love it. I have atomic pink hair and it does not fade my color.	4
I remember being twelve years old when the 12 Play album came out. At the time there really was no other male R&B singer doing it like Mr. Kelly expect for my boy Ralph Tresvant. As I've said in other reviews, R.Kelly's ballads are what make the CD work. Of course everyone knows the singles Your Body's Callin ,It Seems Like You're Ready, Bump & Grind, Sex Me Parts 1 & 2 but there was also the self titled track, the heart-felt cover of Sadie and the sentimental For You. The up-tempo stuff is really weak but the ballads are on-point.	9
I remember the duet between Babyface and Miss Braxton, and how impressed I was by her vocal abilities..Then she came out with this album!! Oh my god, the woman tore up each and every song!! With Babyface's lyrics and production and her voice, this was one those perfect producer-artist teams that could do no wrong..I still love this album to this day..Most of the songs on this album are R&B classics anyway..You know an album is great when no matter how dated it sounds, its still listenable..If your a fan of women who have powerful voices, pick up this cd..You cannot go wrong!!	9
this is a great product for multiple devices in a vehicle that only has one port, i recommend it to anyone looking for extra ports in an older vehicle...!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!	7
We were originally keeping the diapers and wipes on the shelf of the changing table, probably because we didn't think there was a better option. I am so glad we found this, it works and fits perfectly for our changing table.The only issue we have now is that the wipes are accessible by the child being changed, and sometimes she likes to sit up and try to grab the pack. But if this wasn't there, I'm sure she would just find something else to do that is just as inconvenient.	3
This spatula is exactly what I've been trying to find.  It is sturdy enough to lift a 1/2 lb burger out of a cast iron pan, yet thin enough to slide it under the raw burger on my cutting board without distorting the side or bottom, and without moving the burger.  For regular cooking tasks such as steaks, chops, fish, etc., it works perfect.However, if you try to lift a brick like Cooks Illustrated did, it won't hold that much weight.  Since I generally eat food made from actual food, and not bricks, this works for my kitchen.	13
These chisels cut well and hold an edge very well.  The only thing I'm  worried about is the plastic handles.  I have not used a steel hammer on  them, just wood or plastic mallets.  They are holding up well after a month  of occasional use.  Five years from now will be the real test.  The fitted  box is nice and they come with a blade covers to further protect the  cutting surface.  I will keep them in my shop and not bounce them around in  the pickup.  I have a few all steel chisels that are better for  construction duties.	21
I finished all 350 pages in a day and a half. I Couldn't put it down. I've read a lot of great books, but this is by far my favorite of all time and it sooo deserves the five stars I gave it. It's like heartbreak, friendship, falling in love, fear, being forgotten, and a blast from a cruel yet exciting past all in one and I may go read it again once I finish this review. Water for Elephants broke my heart and touched me at the same time.	5
Blue Stinger I think is a must own for anyone with a Dreamcast this game is an action game and a survival horror game the first time you complete this game is the best you can complete it many times but you already know whats going to happen Some bad things about this game are their is some annoying music you have to put up with and you end up killing the same mosters over and over again Their is so much more to say about this game but I'll let you figure them out buy this game	23
My dog loved the original Purina One Adult Chicken with Rice Dog Food.  However, since Purina developed the smart-blend, she won't eat it unless I add some turkey.  The tan color pieces are awful - kind of rubbery.  I went back to buying the regular Purina Chicken and Rice Mix where all the morsels are pretty much the same in size and color.  My dog really likes the older version much better.  I won't be buying the blend mixture again. Sometimes, change isn't better.	19
This is a TERRIBLE dog toy. We received the Stegasaurus version of the toy. The &#34;seams&#34; from the plastic mold are incredibly hard and actually sharp. Unfortunately I gave this to the dog without first investigating it and he quickly began bleeding from cut gums. Even if you &#34;shaved&#34; those off, the Stegasaurus's wide, awkward shape is bad for a medium or small dog at least. The hard bumps all over the outside seam weird. If they were softer, I could see how it would be a gum-massage but these are super hard.	19
I remember watching this movie years ago when I was in junior high. I loved it. I finally got a chance to own it on DVD so I jumped at the chance. It's still a fun film, although it makes very little sense. It seems to be more of a splattertoon rather than a straight up story. I will not get into details, but suffice it to say it is very entertaining, just don't go into it looking for a solid plot. There isn't one. Still, I recommend it to horror fans.	15
Have used this filter for almost a year now and will be replacing it in the next few weeks. Really don't know how you can tell if it is used up or not, but we're just going to replace it every year until we find out something different. Having said that we can attest that there have not been any illness's, bad tastes or smells from our water when we've been hooked up to a park's water supply. Have been in RV Resorts to overnight spaces and so far everything has been fine.	2
Twilight has a lot going for it, but I personally think it is just too top heavy for play.  You have to be a true fan and dedicate an entire day to play this game.  The box states a few hours but it takes an entire hour to set up the game alone.  And the concept is flawed as well, though it has a very nice idea behind it.  My personal bone to pick would be the artwork.  I happen to think it is silly.  But that is me and not a fair thing to say, other than I am the customer.	22
They seem to be about the same weight & sturdyness as most other folders.  What I especially like are the colors -12 folders in each color (red, blue, yellow & green).  Wonderful  for organizing my papers.  I've begun organizing - using the yellow folders for different insurances.  The fastener is a good feature.  For me the fastener is  for an important piece of info,  I'm fastening the original insurance policy for quick, easy reference,  which could otherwise become time consuming  searching among the other papers in the file.  Will use other yellow folders for different i.e. homeowners, auto, etc	17
Always on the lookout for quality children's programming for our family, my wife and I fell in love with this show.  I think I like watching it even more than the kids.  We typically stick with educational shows, which I do not believe this would fall into, but consider this to be a quality show.In addition to its innocence, this show is full of great songs and really encourages imagination.  It is very well thought out, with sub plots of each episode neatly relating to one another and all tying together.This is GREAT stuff!	0
I generally appreciate OXOs thought into design, and this brush is no exception.  It's a little bigger than the last one I had, which I didn't love when I saw it in person, but in the end it's comfortable to hold and it gets the job done.  The size comes in handy when scrubbing potatoes, etc, it's much less &#34;handy crampy&#34; than my last one was.  Would buy again, would certainly recommend this for any cook getting older and having arthritis issues.	13
One word comes to mind when describing this album....classic.  Anyone that tells you otherwise doesn't know what a classic hip hop album should sound like.  Outkast narrorates ghetto tales on top of some of the funkiest beats I've ever heard.  And unlike most southern acts, they got rhyming skills.  I normally rate each song seprately, but there's no need to because the entire album is fire.  If you haven't heard this album, then stop reading this review and go get it......right now!Hottest of The Hot Songs:SouthernplayalisticadillacmuzikPlayer's BallMyintrotoletuknowGit Up, Git Out feat.

I'm happy with this.  Used it to replace the blown speaker from a 30 yr. old 60W Roland Cube Amp (a bass player used the amp and I think it was too much for the speaker -- next time I'll use the PA for the bass player).  Much better sound, perfect fit, etc. Keep in mind this is for a very clean sound and this speaker was recommended for its clean and somewhat smokey-type sound.  I believe it has those.  Using this for jazz applications and having the Roland around as a second amp.	16
"Joseph's Sugar Free Maple Flavor Syrup is pretty good stuff for putting on Italian cakes or rolls. Sometimes I eat this at night and develop the worst form of gas anywhere. I can't help myself and have to let it ""out"" constantly, I don't know if something is in here that makes me act up. I was ejected from a concert hall after my stomach couldn't help itself. Just a warning to diabetics or regular sugar eaters, don't try to swallow the whole bottle in one sitting."	11
What else can I say...I love it.  The 'Super Bib' by Bucket Boss is  GREAT!!  It keeps everything I use on a regular basis handy, yet not in the  way.  Its rugged construction tells me its going to take the beating it  surely will recieve while I wear it. And most important it is comfortable,  and easy to maneuver around in.  I can wear what I want, and not worry  about having to change afterwards. I'm going to buy another one, for when I  have someone over working in my shop with me.	21
I used this diaper pail when I had my first daughter a couple of years ago and I did not like it at all. I thought it was very difficult to use. (until you get used to it)  It didn't contain the smell well at all. The refills were a pain to put in and like another reviewer said it twisted when it wanted to.  The lid also kept coming off of mine. I threw this out and bought the safety 1st odorless diaper pail which I find contains the odor much better.	3
I guess goggles is one of those things that either works for you or it doesn't. Most of Speedo's goggles have great reviews so I wasn't sure which ones would work for me. Ordered the oversized Baja model which wasn't up to the mark for me because it hurt after wearing it for some time. Replaced them with these Hydrospex goggles and these are PERFECT! Very comfortable to wear, keep the water out completely, do not get foggy (I ordered the black ones), and do not hurt at all.	20
My hair is super straight and thin. It also doesn't take heat very well. What's so great about this curler is the adjustable heat settings. 7 works great for me and I just hold it there for ten seconds. Not only that but the curls actually stay. Most times, they go wavy after the first 30 minutes, no matter how long I hold it on for. But with this it lasted me two hours. I'm so impressed and especially for the price. You cannot beat that.	4
This was an easy, entertaining and informative read.  I was enjoying reading this so much that I had my mom and a friend read it too on their kindle and they both loved it.  I wanted to read it for entertainment but ended up enjoying learning so much as well through the story.  I did not see the movie but now I might just to see how much justice they did to the book.  Plus I read it free from the Kindle Lending Library but it would have been worth buying!	5
Granted this thing is accurate and well made (almost bomb proof) but why so heavy and bulky.I dont think it's necessary.I love porter cable products and have used them for years.My edge guide came as a freebie with a package deal I bought.I use it and  have no complaints about it other than it being just too big and heavy.If and When I buy a new edge guide it will be the porter cable model# 5043,it offers the same level of accuracy but without all the bulk. Now get out there and round something over.	21
I am using this great reel with 100 feet of 12/3 and it a perfect fit.  This tool is very handy and just works.  I'm thinking this may also be good for long strains of Christmas lights.  The construction is good and the materials are strong.  I'm glad I purchased it and I will be buying another one.  I live in hurricane land and when the lights go out I'm running extension cords all over the house to my generators; this reel will keep my heavy duty extension cords neat and ready for use.	21
"The KISS ""Crazy Nights"" video is a video all KISS fans should check out.  While ""Lick it Up"" and ""Animalize"" were the best non-makeup 80's albums KISS released, ""Crazy Nights"" still rocked.  So it is defintely a thrill to own three videos for ""Crazy, Crazy Nights"", ""Turn On The Night"", and ""Reason to Live"" all on one cassette.  All of the videos and the songs were great, and the girl who was in the ""Reason to Live"" video was a total babe, and so was the one in the ""Turn On The Night"" video."	6
Bought this one along with a different finger tab for my girl's bow because a 20lbs draw weight was too harsh on her fingers.  As cool as it looks, the leather tips are just too stiff and slippery to grab the string without constant fear of it accidentally slipping off in mid-draw unless you either monkey-grip the string or are VERY careful to keep the pads of your fingers flat against the string.As my girl pointed out, adding razorblades to the fingertips would make for a killer Freddy Krueger glove on halloween, though!	20
I guess I'm in the minority.  I had heard that these were a problem and shrugged off the warning as one from the few malcontents having a bad day and bought this.  Good chewing BUT.....they made my dog sick and he barfed five times.  And guess what came up?  And, yes, the sharp little edges were still there.  No more nylabone products for me. I feel so strongly about the danger of these products that I am making the effort to go to every nylabone product on Amazon to post this warning.  mb	19
A great family game of storytelling that will keep people amused and stimulate the imagination.The artwork is excellent and whimsical. The components are solid.This game board is a revised edition that goes up to 6 players. There are some improvements. The instructions are now pretty clear from box to board not really requiring combing into the rule book making it quite easy to jump in.There's another version that goes up to 12 players, but all that people voting is overkill and hard to track. 6 is enough.	22
Great game!  I haven't played the other ones yet, but I really like this one a lot!  You get Ms. Pac-Man, Dig-Dug, Galaxian, Phozon, and The Tower of Duraga. Dig-Dug is my favorite out of these and all are fun, but some can get a little boring after a while.  The graphics for the psone look great and little to no lag. I really like the theater and the library that is in it too!  Overall, I really enjoyed this game and great for people who love arcade games! Can't wait to get the other Volumes some time.	23
A friend of mine has a Border Collie who is a ruthless and devout chewer, who absolutely adores this toy. But, my Aussie is more of a fetcher than a chewer so although he'll have his moments with it, it's not his go to chew toy. Which is the only reason it lacks full stars for myself. But, despite my dogs personal preferences, as a product this is a great chew toy. If your dog has a tendency to chew through anything and everything for hours on end, I would absolutely recommend this to you.	19
I never expect a lot from microwavable soup cups or bowls. I'm happy if their reasonably edible and are not gunky or too thin. It's a nice surprise when a soup tastes not just edible but very tasty! This creamy tomato parmesan from Campbells is nice ans smooth with just the right hint of cheese and cream. It's a perfect combo for a grilled cheese sandwich or a piece of crusty bread. I've also mixed in some crushed red pepper flakes to spice it up and that works well.Texture: 5/5Taste: 4/5Consistency: 5/5Repeatability: 5/5Total quick lunch score: an excellent 5/5!	11
I didn't even know an older version existed when I got this one... and it was a lot of fun to play. You go through the motions of life... go to college or start a career first, get married, get a house, then if you land on the appropriate spots, you get children (I personally love getting twins). The funniest part for me is when other people get so many children that their little plastic minivans get overloaded and the pegs keep falling off. lol. It's a good family fun game.	22
The title track is a perfect Monk-style masterpiece... edgy, dynamic, and captivating.  It's obviously a difficult song to play, but I'm glad Monk had the patience to do it.  &quot;Bolivar&quot; is a stately blues, and &quot;Pannonica&quot; is another catchy blues.  &quot;I Surrender&quot; is a Monk solo song, and the 20-bit recording sounds great.  &quot;Bemsha Swing&quot; is the liveliest of the group, with Max Roach's tympanis providing the swing.  Sonny Rollins plays sax on this, and is of course superb.	9
I read the reviews about how there's too much static when used on a phone line...I wouldn't know. I only bought this thing to get a credit on my DISH network bill. (They don't tell you they charge per month if you don't have it plugged into a phone line, just that you get a credit each month if you do.) For one year, it doesn't pay, but for a 2-YR contract, it pays itself off after the first year. So, since I didn't have any phone lines anywhere near by, this thing works just fine for what I need.	10
90-ish Jacob Jankowski narrates his story in flashbacks from a nursing home. His days with the circus feel more real and alive to him than his current reality.After his parents are killed in a car accident, Jacob runs out on his vet school exams and joins the circus. Circus life is not always easy, but Jacob has experiences with humans and animals that change his life forever.Gruen brings the Depression-era circus vividly to life, along with its many colorful characters. If Rosie the elephant and Bobo the orangutan don't touch your heart, it's made of stone!Highly recommended!	5
My husband and I both use this shampoo - he for light dandruff control, and me just because I like the way it cleans my fine hair.  It is paraben-free, and does not contain sodium lauryl/laureth sulfates.  The scent is not as refreshing as the scent of Jason Natural Cosmetics - Satin Shower Body Wash/Tea Tree Oil 30 fl oz Gel, which is a fabulous body wash, but it is not a bad scent.  You do need to watch that it doesn't get in your eyes, since tea tree oil can sting a bit.	4
I ordered a handful of different creams to experiment with, and this is the one that I've found least compelling. I've actually gotten up from bed to wash it off as it was burning me. Maybe--- maybe the burning/stinging is somehow a good thing, but it made me nervous (and, of course, hurt a bit!). I've read that retinol is not suggested for people under 40 or maybe 45 and maybe it's just a mismatch between me and the product. Hence, why I was experimenting!	4
One of the most beautiful memoirs ever, not only about Renoir the painter, but about the world long gone of 19th century France.  In fact, if you wanted to recreate that world, this is the blueprint -- not the world of the rich and the powerful (Proust is the blueprint for that), but the world of the rustics, the rural/urban poor, the artisans.Jean Renoir's own memoirs of his life in cinema are also fine, but much more fragmented.  He did write like an angel.	5
We streamed a few shows of Sanctuary (not the best Internet connection at our house for streaming) and decided to buy the Blu-ray disc set as soon as it came out.We save watching the Sanctuary shows for when nothing else is on; we don't want the shows to end too soon.We are Stargate fans, and we find Sanctuary to be a wonderful option for science fiction.Why would any person complain? There is nothing else worth watching for people who only receive over-the-air television.	0
if youre in a tight spot this tool is worth it's weight in gold. however im sure under stressful applications it wont hold up. i tested it on my dewalt impact driver and at full rpm's with no load the tool became pretty hot, im guessing around 170 degrees hot. i have a dewalt 90 degree attachment and it does not get hot under the same condition. nonetheless, under normal conditions and when you need it the most, its a great tool to be able to reach for.	21
I've used this jig saw many times, and I would recommend it to anyone from a hobbyist to the most experienced contractor.  The barrel grip gives the operator the utmost of control (more so than the top handle model).  The blade change is a snap and through vigorous use shows no sign of blade slippage.  The variable speed control allows you to cut through a variety of materials without putting too much of a strain on the motor causing it to prematurely wear out.  This is by far the best jig saw I've ever used or owned.	21
Barnes & Noble NOOK COLOR eBook Reader Tablet (WiFi Only) w/ SanDisk 1GB microSD CardI won't get into all the things this amazing eReader can do. You can read all the other 5 star reviews for these details.But here's a really IMPORTANT one that shouldn't be overlooked when considering the purchase of an eReader.On the Nook, you can read THOUSANDS of FREE fiction and non-fiction books (from most local libraries) that are in the EPUB format.The Kindle cannot do this.	10
I remember this when it was on PBS---I was glued to the set--and then spent a long time looking for it on DVD--I could not afford it when it first came out and the I got it from Amazon.com.I love Trevor Eve in this and the Waking the Dead Series.There is just something about this series--I have watched it many times since getting it in 2008 and loaned it out to my family. I wish there would have been a few more--but I can curly up with pop-corn on a sunday rainy afternoon and --well, enjoy!!!	15
Pure mastery in words revealing the essence of life. Very simply, this book speaks to everyone. It doesn't matter who you are or what you believe. It brings tears to me each time I read it, because if your mind is open, you will achieve a feeling of higher existence upon completion of your reading. I hope you will take that understanding and infuse it within all you do.I also recommend listening to Richard Harris' reading of this book, though it may be out of print these days.	5
I'll make this as short as possible...........like I wish the book would have been.  This read was easily twice as long as it needed to be.  I got halfway through, and quit.  It was so boring.  I wanted, (as always), a good story, not a tedious dialog that goes on and on about every little detail involved in colonizing a planet.  I can't believe this author is receiving accolades for this work.  He can, in no way, be compared to any of the greats in the sci-fi field.	5
This case has a perfect snug fit. I had first tried the Dzitronic case which was very good, and seemed to be slightly thicker, and felt slightly heavier, but offered great protection. This case is more convenient for daily use since it is lightweight, and offers good protection. Judging from the thickness of the Dzitronic case cover.. it might be a better protector in case of accidental drops, but this boxwave case is looks better, feels better, and has a better fit although it is thinner and lighter.	7
The WEP200 sounds pretty good, is easy to use and is pleasantly small, but the system for keeping it in the ear is nearly useless. It comes with three different sizes of these little rubber loop things that are supposed to create enough pressure and friction on the inside of the auricle to keep the device in place, but none of them would keep the little thing in my ear, it would always fall out.It comes with nice a little case that also serves as the charger.  However, this device also a little bit overpriced. So, on to the next one.	7
If you enjoyed this dice-infused worker placement game, this expansion adds five new &#34;modules&#34; to mix in to your base game. Larger building boards, alternate building rows, unique roles, yearly condition cards, and non-random winter army chips make this game customizable and ensures a varied game each time. The new buildings and cards especially help keep the game fresh once you find all the different strategies in the base game. Notably there is no board extension, no more dice, and no more monster cards but that doesn't hurt the expansion at all.	22
I LOVE this gate and would buy it again. I like how it swings open both ways, opens with a foot pedal so it's hands free, and is incredibly sturdy though it's pressure-mounted. My ONLY disappointment with this gate is that it doesn't fit well on our stairs. We live in a small apartment and the wall doesn't jut out far enough from the bottom step in order for the foot pedal to work. Instead, I mounted the gate in the doorway of our baby's nursery, and it is working out GREAT.	3
Roller Coater Tycoon is by far one of the best simulator PC game I have ever played.  This game is what it sounds like...You build a theme park.  There are many different environments to choose from(you get more environments as you beat more levels.  The graphics in this game aren't jaw dropping but they are okay.  But this game isn't about graphics, it's about freedom.  It's very challenging to get your guests to actually like your park:)This is a great PC game and is highly reccomended.~Dan~	23
Plug this in. Sometimes it connects; sometimes it doesn't.I hear callers just fine, but they ask if I am in the bathroom when I wear this.If I leave it plugged into the earphone jack of my phone, it somehow manages to turn my phone off after a few minutes of non-use.I would send it back, but my total cost was only $3.My phone is an older Motorola v365, and I'm sticking with to my BluetoothPlantronics 510 [Retail Packaging]. Maybe this can be an emergency backup.	7
I thought this product would be a wonderful idea for the creative child who likes to write stories and draw pictures, so I gave it to my 8 year old grandaughter.  However, for some reason, she just was uninterested in doing the project.  You have to write your own story and draw your own pictures, which she has done before.  I guess she just wasn't in the creative spirit at the time, because the kit is still in her closet unused.  I still think it's a great idea, but it probably takes a lot of parent participation and encouragement along with the child.	22
"Really I did -- usually along with Rocky Horror or a Jimi Hendrix film.  Had no choice since there was no video footage available to buy at the time.  Some parts are hokey, and it's a shame most performances are cut, but it's Zep in their heyday.  Does anyone else notice how much Crowe's ""Almost Famous"" rips off this movie (all the way down to the acoustic-accompanied limo ride through NYC)?  A better choice is the double Carruthers DVD.  That shows Zeppelin from their origins to their later years in un-cut performances."	6
Viva Las Vegas was a great purchase, and I'm so happy to have it in my collection. What makes it fun is seeing Vegas back in the day -- I could just imagine Frank, Sammy and Peter Lawford lurking in the background!If you're an Elvis fan, you already know how great this musical is. If you are not familiar with The King's movies, this one would be a great place to start. The fact that Ann Margaret's dance numbers in Viva Las Vegas have been so frequently immitated speaks for itself.Highly recommended!	6
I got this for a baby prairie dog to keep him warm while he was in his cage. I ended up just getting a pouch and holding him most of the day since he refused to sleep on this. That isnt due to this being a bad product though. It holds heat nicely without being too hot and the fleece is very soft and really keeps it so its warm instead of being HOT. I would highly recommend it for any animal in need of some warmth! Also it does stay heated for 12 hours like it claims.	19
I had not read a story of a survivor from Bialystok, Poland.  I had read previously read a story of a Rabbi from Bialystok, but he spent the war in Russia.  Therefore, this account was more descriptive of the cultural climate of the region.I am always amazed at how Holocaust victims survived the horrific events that were forced upon them.I will say that the formatting on the Kindle was not good.  If you are easily distracted by format issues, I would not recommend getting it on the Kindle.	14
This is a really convenient book stand if you like to read outside of home and don't have larger books. If you don't necessarily need the portability or if you have large/tall textbooks I would suggest you look at something more study as this tends to tip over/make indentations on the bottom of pages for those books. Also you can increase the height of the stand by pulling  up part of the metal frame, but even with doing this it doesn't really support larger books well enough to easily highlight.	13
I can't add much to the overwhelmingly positive reviews. These are the most comfortable underwear, quickest drying, stay dry, easy to clean, least smelling pairs I've had.They would actually make a great gift because a lot of guys probably will not spend this much for a pair, although I am just mad I didn't sooner. But because of that, think about it. The packaging is nice also and gives a lot of info on why they are so great. So treat yourself or someone who deserves a great item.	8
"Actual Miles: Henley's Greatest Hits being Henley's greatest hits compilation release 1995 and contains hits from 1982 to 1995. The album contains classic Henley tracks such as ""The Boys of Summer"", ""Dirty Laundry"", ""The End of the Innocence"" and ""The Heart of The Matter"".  The booklet is strange of used carsales man and I do not know what the point of this is. Only one track has the lyrics included but we do get linernotes written by Henley. We do get a list of the muisicians on each track but not what they play on each track. 4/5."	9
"We just got this game for our 4.5-year-old, and he is loving it. It's not too challenging for him since he can already count very well, but as we play, we help him keep track of his ""cherries"" and this involves addition and subtraction. This is a perfect game for a child just learning to count or a child who just loves counting, adding, subtracting. I'm sure my son will outgrow it before too long, but it's not expensive and well worth it for the numbers practice and the entertainment value."	22
These Skimp Skamp Briefs are the most comfortable undies I've ever worn, and I've been buying them for a long, long time. They're perfect for anyone who doesn't like bikini or high-rise panties. After three babies, I can't wear those things anymore. The fabric moves with you, and they're practically invisible under clothing. I add Oxi-Clean to the detergent when I wash them, as chlorine bleach does a number on them. Plus I use a hanger with clips to air-dry them on the shower rod, as they last longer that way.	8
I just got this today and have used the app on Kindle and gone to the website. It is a really great app. So easy to add your foods and exercises. I have already drastically lowered my portions. I will update when I have shown progress.Update:  I have lost 7 lbs in 8 days and my BMI is back in the healthy range. No more guessing about calories and value of the various exercises I do. What I have learned-really step upthe exercise and activity level and avoid sugars. The best thing. Not at all hungry.	1
I purchased this for my Delta Platinum Contractor's Saw with Unifence.  Installation is pretty straight-forward, although I have to modified my Rockler outfeed table a bit to accommodate one of the mounting brackets.  Once installed, the blade guard works very well.  I particularly like the easily-removable splitter -- very handy when I am using my sliding table.  My only gripe is that I wish there is a vacuum port in the blade guard.  The saw dusts seem to be focused to fly directly back at you -- I guess that is a good reminder not to stand directly inline with the blade!	21
I've always considered buying this brand because I've seen it advertised in several magazines as a &#34;best beauty pick&#34; so I thought it must be good.  I really don't find it that great of a mascara.  I think it's more of the wand than the mascara itself.  It's a very thin brush and you have to coat your lashes like 20 times to get decent coverage.  I also prefer curved mascara wands because I think they make application easier than straight ones do.  This mascara has a straight wand.  I'd rate this product as average.	4
I've been very happy with my purchase.  My Koolatron kept drinks and snacks very cold with no problem.  As other reviewers have already noted you need to power up the unit roughly 12 hours prior to loading it with items you want to keep it cold.  This unit is not a refrigerator so if you pack it with items not chilled already in refrigerator then it will be a long time before things get cold.Whether my unit will be reliable long term I cannot say but on my recent use I have used it four days straight without a problem.	20
I love these pantyhose and have worn them in the past.  The reason that I gave 3 stars is that the sizing info isn't helpful.  When you click on it, you see sock sizes.  There should be a chart online, just as there is on the back of the pantyhose package.  So, I'll return them because of incorrect sizing.  I have ordered another size.  However, I do appreciate being able to get the color pearl.  In the stores, they are mostly brown.  I have fair skin, so brown pantyhose don't look right on me.	8
I played Croc 2 more often, but I did play Croc: Legend of the Gobbos when I was young.  These games were so fun, as well as difficult (I never managed to get 100% completion on either of them).  The controls are a bit stiff, but this did release in 1997, so that should be expected.  The game is quite difficult and the story itself is quite simple, but the game is fun nonetheless, and for me it's a pretty timeless classic, that I am happy to add to my collection of childhood memories and video games.  Definitely worth the money.	23
I was impressed by the quality of this film. It was gorgeous, sensitive, understated, quiet, moving and real. The words were few and meaningful, the acting real.It's not for the kiddies and it's not for Transformer fans. Please watch something on the Sci Fi Channel instead. Monsters is a film for those who love honest stories and gorgeous cinema.YES! art films can have a plot and a story! Monsters once again proves that the best, most original and most moving films originate outside of the bloated, fly-blown carcass that is Hollywood.	0
I bought  this to hold HKS 36-A Speedloaders for my CCW. This works perfectly. With the rigid sides it is easy to get the loader in and out quickly without catching like the soft ones. It is a bit bulky and since I carry a 38 there is some rattle from the extra room my loaders have but from under my shirt I don't notice it. Also it takes some getting use to since it is very stiff, I have trouble moving it around my belt to get a comfortable position when driving.	20
I've read several books by this author and find myself completely baffled by this poor example of her writing.  The storytelling was so simplistic that it came across as the first work of a freshman English major.  I trained FBI agent would make out with a federal judge whose life is in danger up against his car out in the open?  Story totally lacked realism.  What a waste.  Save your money.  If you like this author avoid this book.  It will sully your better memories of her writing.	14
I would recommend this for a travel magnifier for the occasional reading.I had read on another review about a magnifier having a problem with the light coming on. I did find that this one appeared to be DOA out of the box. But, after opening & shutting the viewer to turn on & off the light, the light began to come on. After several times of doing this, the light appears to be coming on all the time.It is small, but for taking it someplace & reading things like a menu in a dark corner of a restaurant, this is great.	12
I HAVE TO BE HONEST I DID NOT ENJOY THIS MOVIE AT ALL, LOOKING AT THE REVIEW ON AMAZON, SUGGESTED IT MIGHT BE PRETTY GOOD, BUT I HAVE VIEWED OVER 240 CHRISTMAS MOVIES AND THIS ONE IS ONE I WILL PUT IN MY NO# 6 BOOK AND LETIT COLLECT DUST. I JUST DID NOT LIKE THE PEOPLE STARRING AND THE WAY IT WAS PRESENTED. I DO NOT USUSALLY DISLIKECHRISTMAS MOVIES BUT THIS ONE, SOMEONE WHO GOES TO CHURCH ALOT MIGHT ENJOY IT? I BOUGHT THIS FROM THE AMAZON MARKETAREA, AND IT WAS A GOOD PRICE.	15
"The story premise was cute. Hunky editor ""tricks"" his prized writer into learning more about his desires. She thinks he's too hot to be interested. He's decided to go for broke to show her what she means to him. And, he's trying to bring her out of her funk after her cat died and show her that she CAN let someone get close enough for her to love. A handy snowstorm comes along to trap them together. It was very erotic, as the title suggests. Good, hot, short read. I will have to find more from Mari Carr."	14
I am tickled pink with this apple corer! We lost the old one (same model) in a house move, and I replaced it with a cheap one from the supermarket. It was so bad that my infinitely patient husband who never in 13 years has complained about a gadget asked me to get a better one! It was that bad.  I got the OXO now, and it's a pleasure to use.  Be cautious though, those blades are actually very sharp on the bottom side. Excellent!	13
unfortunately this is one of those games that was &quot;good&quot; on blackberrys because the java based crapOS ment this.game was top of the line. coming to android will be a.different story, but the game it self was fun when I played it on the storm. The closest thing I can compare it too is Bloon TD 1or2. luckly 4 is on one or more android stores. Would recomend spending 1$ on that over this anyday. To all BB devs... either step up your game or go down with the dieing BB ship.	1
I don't have much to say, beyond what's already been said.I would like to point out that the notification noises(played through the headphones) are LOUD!  It hurts my ears every time I turn it on and off.  Maybe, after a few months of everyday use, my hearing will degrade to the point that it doesn't hurt anymore. I certainly hope not.  The only solution I've been able to find so far is to hold them away from my ears when turning them on and off.  Very annoying.	7
I've ordered Bandolino's in the past and always had a good fit (size 10).  In fact, the day I ordered these Mylah's I also ordered the Bandolino Capture pumps[[ASIN:B00B5NSRLU Bandolino Women's Capture FB Platform Pump].  The Bandolino Capture's fit great, but the Mylah style was to tight across the toes and very tight over the top of my foot.  These shoes just run small. I ordered the Gold and I did like the style and color, just wish they fit correctly.	8
This is actually one of the first CD's I ever owned so it holds a special place in my heart...That said, this has actually held up pretty well over the years. It's their second release; features a great combination of dance music, r&amp;b, and even a little jazz.  It's got a great vibe from start to finish; very solid throughout.  Very head-nod-friendly.Good stuff.  It's too bad this band basically fell off the face of the earth after this release.	9
If you like anything with action & suspense around the life of a spy, you will enjoy Covert Affairs.  I do like the show.... and all the characters, however, after watching episode after episode of &#34;Alias&#34; for free as an Amazon Prime Member....  I have to say...  It is hard not to compare the two and if I had to choose one..... I would choose &#34;Alias&#34;.  Since I've already watched all of those episodes, I will still be looking forward to watching Annie in Covert Affairs!!	0
The odor was too strong for me. It was a fruity sweet smell but it wasn't working for me.  I had to wash my moustache within five minutes because I couldn't stand it.Also the brown mustache had a strong white layer look to it.  It was looking bad to me visually.It did hold the hairs into place for the brief time I used it.The only useful thing I got out of it was the small brush. Managed to pull one hair out but still nice addition to my comb / brush collection.	12
"This pruning stick works like a charm. Pull down on the handle or the end ball and voila, cuts through 1+"" branches with relative ease.Safety is the name of the game.Thorns and prickles gone.You've got 62"" distance between you and some pain. Lower levels on the ladder.This is a must have for anyone having to prune any brush of height or thorns..I have had mine for about 5yrs and it is still in excellent shape.Seems like the cutting mechanism should last a long long time.The pivoting head is very useful as well."	18
"This movie is no ""Christine"" but it's got a good cast.  James Brolin, Ronny Cox, and a couple of nice looking unknown babes, but that's about it.  And with my new 47"" HDTV, I think the picture quality was very good.  The backdrop of the mountains and plateaus of Utah were a little blurry, but the close-up shots of everybody looked pretty good.  So, if you remember this movie (from 1977), and you think you remember that you enjoyed it, than you'd probably appreciate getting the DVD.  It's good for a few laughs anyway."	15
No, this stuff doesn't beat boiling chicken carcasses, but it comes pretty close. Regular chicken bouillon can't compare. Mix this stuff with chicken breast, noodles, vegetables, and spices and you get a very good chicken soup. A crock pot/slow cooker really shines on this kind of dish.The problem: I live in Hawaii, one of the most expensive parts of the country. The most expensive grocery store sells this for 6.59. I buy it for 4.79. Usually Amazon shines on this kind of thing, but not with the Better than Bouillon series.	11
Makes handling of leaves, shrubbery, or any other garden item needed to be picked up and disposed an easy task. I use it to pick up leaves, branches and pine needles in my yard. I went from using a shovel and my hands to using these and it makes the task so much easier and shorter.They are made of plastic so long term use is a question, but as with any item if used properly and taken care of should last a long time. Also for the price you cant go wrong.	18
Bought this for my 3-year-old son who is learning his letters.  Thought it would compliment what he is learning in school.  It is simple enough, that he can follow the directions.  He's a little short to be able to reach everything, but the instructions state that you get points for what you can do (you don't have to do everything to score points).  I even had fun playing, so I won't complain when he asks to play.  He's just the right age to start playing this.	22
Had I been thinking I would have taken before and after shots of the flute cleaning.  Basically, the flute hadn't been used in over 30 years and sat around becoming dull and oxidized.  Needless to say, after some dabs of Flitz and about 10 or more squares of paper towels, it looks brand new!  The paper towels and my hands were so black with oxidation, it was truly amazing.This stuff has done it all for me and I can easily say it is the best cleaner an polish out there.  Hands down.	2
"I love that this gate installs very easily, and the gate swings both ways.  We installed this in a bedroom frame, and easily moved it to over the stairs. I love that it doesn't leave any residue on the walls. Be sure the use the wrench it comes with which makes it very easy.The measurements it gives you are pretty accurate for the max length it can do, our stairway is just over 39"" and it barely doesn't fit with the first extension so we had to add another."	3
This story is very short (think novella), but it it's very well-written and the plot moves at a nice, quick pace. This is a great, easy read for a few hours (especially for the beach or that plane trip).The story revolves around an estranged couple, a misunderstanding, and a cute and funny revelation at the end.I don't really understand the negative/mediocre reviews, because I personally loved this story.  I get that everyone has their own opinion, but if you're a fan of adult historical fiction, you will definitely enjoy this!	14
They've really outdone themselves on this album. They're playing harder than they've ever played and the arrangements are outstanding. Neil is absolutely destroying his drums.I personally want to thank producer Nick Raskulinecz for working with these guys and pushing them to play to their full potential....the results speak for themselves.BTW, I loved BU2B but the album version is even better than the original. The title track is mind blowing and it amazes me how these guys can keep progressing and coming up with such great music.	6
Written poetically. But the horror of the trenches, he does not come too close.He sees the war from the stage. The wanton destruction of civilian buildings, churches, public buildings is just another step on the road of history. From the destruction of the Alexandrian library-up to the current Coronation Hiroshima. Nothing has changed. It is just waiting for things to come.He could imagine the horror only partially. The book does not fall into the category of war propaganda. It's the surprise, the mourning over the extinction of cities that have grown over the centuries.	14
"Tazo's ""Refresh"" tea definitely lives up to its name.  The tea is caffeine-free, which is great for those of us who get jittery after just a little bit of caffeine.  It contains peppermint, spearmint, and tarragon, which leave a pleasant, refreshing aftertaste in your mouth.  I love this tea hot on a chilly winter day, but it's also great iced.  Definitely my favorite Tazo tea, and one of the most versatile.Overall, I highly recommend Tazo ""Refresh"" tea for anyone looking for a fresh, minty tea.  This is sure to become a household favorite."	11
"""Water For Elephants"" paints a runaway's story of joining the circus, interspersed with an old man's sad realities.  Bringing to life colorful characters that abound in the time of the train circus, Gruen strikes a balance between the despondency of the 1930s and the timelessness of hope and longing, both in the past and present.  An easy coming-of-age  must-read to curl up by the fire with!(I can't say I'm surprised that the book is being turned into a movie, though it'll be interesting to see if the movie manages to capture the poignancy of the old man's recollections...)"	5
"Rain-X Washer Fluid Additive works far better than I expected it to. I had serious doubts about getting the same results seen in the advertising, but after about a week of using the treated washer fluid my car's window was really ""beading"" water.It is interesting to watch the difference between rain water on the treated area (where my wipers push the washer fluid) and the non-treated areas. It is very clear that this is working when you see the water quickly rolling away.This is a great product! Highly Recommended!"	2
When I first used this, it was the most painful experience EVER. I got teary eyed. I'm not a big baby but I thought I had wasted my money when I used it.BUT, I decided not to let that get in my way so I used it again a few weeks later and TADAH....No pain. I was whoa confused. But I guess after the first time I got used to it.I have used traditional waxing and SUGAR waxing is way less painful and this is SO EASY to clean up.	12
I've been wearing Chuckie's since I was a kid(over 40 years!!). Original Chuck Taylor's are the biggest icon ever to hit sneakers, with the same bulletproof looks and simple construction throughout the years. They might offer zero arch support(easily fixed with a set of insoles), and can wear down a bit faster than newer brands, but there is no denying that, for the price paid, there's no finer example of what a sneaker is.With all of the new colors available, it has and will always be the king....buy a pair and find out for yourself why.	8
This has 6 applications, where you use this on your dog once every month for 6 months during the summer months.  It helps to kills fleas and ticks that might get on your dog.  No dog should be left outside all day in the summer, because there is a bigger chance of your dog to get fleas and ticks.  Take them for walks, and let them out with you, but don't keep them out in the yard all day.  They need water, and air conditioning is nice!!!!	19
This product is fantastic! I've tried a variety of methods of keep the deer and rabbits from eating everything in my yard with various and inconsistent results. However, after using this product, nothing in my yard has been nibbled by the wildlife, and the  bonus is that it claims to be organic and it smells like pretty mild. It seemed to last about a week the first time before needing to be re-applied, and then after a rain shower, I re-applied...so far....and the motorized sprayer is a great addition!	18
I've used a 6-qt. aluminum pressure cooker for years.  It finally bit the dust so I decided to try a stainless steel cooker.  This one is taller, but not as wide, as my previous cooker.  However, it is plenty big to hold a 3-4 pound chicken or roast, which is what I usually cook in it.  So far I really like it - and no problems yet with hardware rusting like I've read in a few reviews.  I would recommend this one to anyone who needs a not-too-big pressure cooker!	13
"I recently sent two of my Ovations back to the factory in Connecticut for re-work (I just plain wore them out), and they came back to me with these strings on them.  As soon as I took them out of their case and strummed them, I immediately called the factory and said ""thanks for the fantastic job on these guitars, and by the way, these are the best sounding strings I've ever played, what exactly are they?""  I might experiment with the EXP15s, but by and large, these EXPs are my new strings."	16
The fit is both tight and comfortable; very usable on pretty much any exercise machine.  Earbuds aren't an option for me given the weird geometry of my ears, and these are just perfect.  The folding design works well in a gym bag, too.Plenty of bass, and more than enough volume when driven through my cheap MP3 player.  I wouldn't mistake these for my dearly-departed Grado SR60s, but they're half the price and much more portable.I had a pair of these in the early '90s, and loved them back then too.	10
The prophet by Kahlil Gibran is a very beautiful, inspiring writing which really resonated within me, it felt as truth. I feel that with good patience and deep contemplation, this book can lead you to a profound understanding of your own life and all others around you.I first read about Kahlil Gibran in a book calledThe Lost Teachings of Atlantis. That book answered all my spiritual questions about the meaning of Life, who and what we are and more in a very easily understandable manner and all of it corresponds with the writing of Kahlil Gibran. I HIGHLY recommend reading that book also.	5
We have used the butterfly garden twice already. I ordered the larva online (5 bucks I think) and shipping was pretty fast, within 4 or 5 days. Since my daughter was in the 5-6 range when using, it involves some adult help (transferring the cocoons, feeding, placing in a safe area away from curious cats, etc). I like that there is an option to reorder more caterpillars from their website. The two times that I ordered, I received 5 larva each time and all hatched (even when one of the cocoons fell off the paper when transporting).	22
I have been using erythritol in baking for about a year now.  After trying nearly every kind of sugar replacement, I have finally settled on this one.  It measures cup-for-cup like sugar, making it easy to adapt recipes and it acts just like sugar when it is baked.  Other artificial sweeteners turn baked goods dry or cakey or crumbly, but this stuff is PERFECT.It does have a slight &#34;cooling&#34; taste; not exactly minty.  I don't mind it, but it does make it difficult to use with some flavors.	11
WIDER than you may expect, and not quite 2 feet tall.Step forward, backward, or straddle, this is a great step ladder.If you have ever, even almost steped off the wrong side of a lesser two foot ladder, spend the difference and get twice the ladder. With steps on both halves it safer, your worth it.Update I bought this April 2006, I like it so much I bought the four foot version #T7404 It is awesome, not just me but those i work with all want to use this twin ladder, having steps on only one side is a huge disadvantage!	21
After Yatra this is the next of Parsons' discs to own, in my opinion. I would say this is more for the seasoned electronic music listener. The disc starts off with the piece, Tantra. This contains Tibetan trumpets, large hand cymbals, and Tibetan monks throat singing. The track builds to an exciting conclusion.The tracks, Tsaparang, Lauhaul Valley, and Dorje Ling follow in a similar vein. These are deep excursions into meditative electronic music. K-2 is a lighter piece that ends the disc. Highly recommended.	6
"As others have written here, this is the album that bridges Elvis v1.0 and Declan v1.0.  Whether it's the masterpiece where black and white turns to color (i.e. The Beatles' Revolver) is often debated.  For my money, this is the best that Elvis/Dec would do for at least the next 15 years - his subsequent work, IMHO, being dabblings in this genre or that.This would have been 5 stars, but my ears are STILL bleeding from the horrible, early digital on the original release mastered on the ""CBS Discomputer.""  Rhino has done an admirable job of de-digitizing this album."	9
How well this device holds up depends on what kind of surface it is attached to.  It can be drilled into adobe or other wall surfacing like wood.  It should hold a 50' hose with no problem, or a longer electrical cord.  It's quite simple and made to keep a garden hose or cord from laying on the ground and being an obstacle.  How effective it is depends on how high off the ground it is and how secure it is mounted.  It does not come with any screws.	18
Rated for heat tolerance up to 250 degrees, this is a specialty masking tape designed for paint baking projects and is priced accordingly. But the product is also useful for a variety of other tasks. As a painters tape, it worked well to mask-off a tile back splash doing a stellar job preventing the paint from migrating onto the taped area. It also peeled off in one piece, avoiding a problem I have encountered when using basic painters tape. In preparation for framing,  I also used it to mount a photograph to a matting board. Again, it performed flawlessly.	17
couple of gripes:1. a metal whisk scratches the plastic (I use a metal whisk for every baking task except measuring, separating eggs and kneading).2. relatively shallow, so more to clean up afterward.  also, if I put my arm around the bowl, the ingredients spill.good points:it's big.  it's a good value (for the size). it's relatively lightweight, but sturdy. rubberized bits are helpful.conclusion:I'll use it for tossing/sifting ingredients, or holding larger quantities. won't use it for actual batter/dough making.	13
I've owned two of these. It is great that it rests against your ear, and is very comfortable not having an earpiece sticking in your ear. The first one I owned, after a month, lost most of its volume. I could not make the volume louder via the volume control; the volume control actually never seemed to work, but at least at first the volume was real good...for about a month. The second one I bought lasted about 9 months, but now the button to answer or hang up on a call does not work.	7
I've been wanting this album and I finally got it! I understand that too short says inappropriate lyrics in this record, but this is for entertainment for grown ups, not appropriate for kids though. When I first heard the single Freaky Tales in appearance in the movie The Wood, I was hit when I heard that song. It appears when the blood gang are crushing and smoking. I wanted to know who was the artist to the song and I finally found out and I wanted to get this album and I finally got!Warning: Not Appropriate For Kids!	9
This stand seems to be made especially with the Fender Stratocaster in mind and might also be a perfect fit for other Fender guitars.  On my Les Paul the cable plug on the guitar is exactly where the bottom holder bar is.  If I adjust the guitar so the plug is not on the bar, the guitar sits at an angle where the guitar might tip over on it's side.Needless to say I will use this stand for my Stratocaster but I am purchasing a different model for the Les Paul.	16
Excellent addition to my kitchen!  I needed to replace the cheap can openers that I purchased after my Pampered Chef one broke.  I love this can opener!  The handles are large and provided a great gripping surface, the turn handle is large which makes it easy for anyone who may have problems with their hands or wrist (I have carpool tunnel in mine), and it opens cans in a flash.  The only downside is that it can not be washed in the dishwasher - other than that - fantastic!	13
Lovely, useful product. Works as expected! But...I would rather pay for a slightly larger labeling machine in order to get a MUCH LARGER (and longer) tape cartridge. If Brother were to increase the label tape length, it would only cost PENNIES to do so.Is Brother's profit important enough to damage the company's public reputation? Why not offer a more equitable cost/value ratio to customers? If the company (Brother) had GIVEN me the labelling machine free of charge, I would be more agreeable to their high prices of the consumables.	10
Pros: The product looks very sleek, and is very useful. I used the build-in laser pointer for my presentation. Flash light looks useful as well, but I didn't have a chance to use it yet, maybe when blackout or go camping.The battery is very sufficient for my iPhone. I fully charged my iPhone 4s and still had plenty of Battery left. I like its portability: small size + light weight.Cons: Should come with AC adapter (Wall charger). The flash light should be brighter, otherwise it is gonna be useless.5 out of 5 Stars !!	7
These pads, which, as I age, I'm finding useful are indeed very discreet and also eliminate odors.  I have COPD, which means a lot of coughing and sneezing, and the consequences of age (80!) plus these - well, anyone interested will know what I mean!They come in different lengths and thicknesses, so there's a lot of choices to allow you to decide just which ones you'll need.  This brand was my first choice, and I've been very satisfied, so haven't tried other brands. I do recommend these.	12
Early in my married days we were living, well let's call it, a low-income life. With a baby on the way I picked up another (lower-cost) brand. The sticks were harder and the cotton wasn't nearly as puffy and soft.All I can say is that on this item you CAN tell the difference!So in my house we always carry the Q-tips brand of cotton swabs and I must admit we also use a decent (and soft) toilet paper as well.Some things just aren't worth skimping on no matter how tight your budget.	4
I Love the idea of this but didn't like the story. We will do the elf with our own version of the story without the naughty or nice aspect. I am not comfortable telling my child that santa will not come if he is &#34;naughty&#34;. We will encourage striving for the &#34;nice&#34; behavior without threats. Is there really any parent out there who would actaully follow through with withholding presents in the case of undesirable behavior? I really hope not so why make the threat. Think intrinsic motivation not extrinsic...	22
If I need to order another, this will be the one.  I used this to mount a TV to the wall in my basement and it allows me to pull the tv out from the wall and turn it towards my desk so I can watch TV while working on the PC, nearly a 90 degree angle.  My TV is only a 32&#34; and I could see that this would work up to a 40&#34; or so, but if you don't need to turn the TV 90 degrees, you could get by with a larger TV.	10
Can't say anything bad about the gun -- well constructed and built to last a lifetime. However, I see what people are talking about with the instructions. They're not really instructions. No parts labeled, nothing but a drawing of the unit itself, and another small diagram showing the spring release pulled back and locked. Other than that, the instructions literally consist of one 107-word run-on sentence that leaves you scratching your head. So just don't even read it, just throw it in the trash unless you want to laugh.	2
This is the light I use for my red-eared slider (an aquatic turtle).  She's a foot long and lives in a heated 120-gallon aquarium.  She loves basking under this light and it really helps keeps her shell nice and healthy by allowing her to completely dry off as she soaks up the rays and warmth.  I keep it on for 12 hours each day but it lasts quite a long time, long enough that I can never even remember the last time I had to change it.	19
If you follow the directions on the box, steeping your tea, you will have a delicious, spicy cup of ginger tea.  This is real ginger taste, not an artificial one.I could not remember what brand of ginger tea I'd bought previously.  By reading the product description and consumer reviews, Traditional Medicinals Organic Ginger Aid seemed like a decent choice.  I am very happy with my selection.  I served it to a friend who loved it and shared half of my six boxes with her.  We'll be ordering more, I'm certain.	11
I have to agree with a previous poster that said the straps were too long.  I adjusted it to the shortest setting and it still was loose.  I've probably only had that problem with 1% of all the bras I've ever bought, and sadly this was one of them.  The cups run generously sized (which for me, as a D/DD usually is a positive thing, but in this design was too much of a good thing & I would have to size down).  The overall design was cute, but the odd sizing made it a no-go.	8
"Good deal on cotton patches which seem to clean better than the thin paper type.  However, I had trouble with it fitting through my Remington R700 in .308 caliber.  I had to fold to triangle shape and cut 1/4"" off of each patch before running through.  No problems through 7.62x39 and 7.62x54 barrels though.  Not sure why that was the issue, since they are all .30 caliber.  I'm guessing it is the difference between my cleaning rods as I use different attachments for all 3.  However, would purchase again."	20
I have sensitive skin and combination at that. I used to spend much more money on the kinerase moisturizer. But I decided to try other brands so save some money. After several attempts on different brands. I found this gem! Diamond in the rough! It lasts me a long time and I have no reaction to it. I only hope they don't discontinue it any time soon because I really don't want to find another one and chances are, it will be much more expensive. At this price you should definitely try this.	4
"I needed more space for ""digital devices"". I have a laser printer and needed a place to put the office scanner I just purchased. This fits perfectly on top of the printer without making the printer unusable. The paper comes out of the printer and the scanner sits right on top of this awesome device.The stand is metal and very sturdy. It can easily hold an old CRT monitor... though, who even has one nowadays?It is marketed as a monitor stand, but you can (obviously) use it wherever you want and put whatever you want on it."	17
This is hulled barley; the hull is left on and must cook longer than pearl barley, but the end result is better nutrition.  There are cooking directions on the package.However, for ten bucks... way too expensive.  The volume of 1 lb of hulled barley can fit into about one sandwich baggie.Though I have no complaints with the product, and a little bit of barley goes a long way.... at this price point, it is too expensive for me to order again.  There is better value elsewhere on amazon.com	11
"This is some str8 killa from the Kingz...Bun B and Pimp C Def. Show some real talent & ability on this record....easily up there w/""Ridin' Dirty"" & ""Too Hard to Swallow"".  These guys have some of the tightest beats and rhymes out there...10 years+ later, it's still better than most s*** out there.  My Fav tracks are ""I left it Wet for ya"", ""Underground"", ""Feds in Town"", ""It's Supposed to Bubble"",....they're all tight..Super tight...check this one out!!"	9
It's really a pity that this saw is no longer made. I bought mine over 20 years ago, and since then it's built cabinets in my house, remodeled a friend's restaurant, and been loaned out many time. It's light, powerful, and cuts very smoothly with no vibration. If you're making cabinetry and not cutting 2x lumber you really don't need a 7-1/2&#34; saw. This unit is smaller, lighter, and a real pleasure to use. I'm hoping I can keep mine going for another decade or two.	21
What a wonderful and delightful book! This is a look thru the eyes of a 93-year young man of his experiences with the circus mixed with today.  What an experience he had in years gone  by; what we do to our elders now because we are too busy with our own  daily lives. This has an absolutely magnificent ending...something quite unexpected and heartwarming. I hope there is a circus in town when I get to Jacob's age and my family is busy with their life. I think I would make a great ticket taker.	5
I enjoyed this novel .  If you have a passing interest in India's fascinating history, you will find it a light but interesting read.  Or if you wish to visit the sub-continent and Delhi, it will illuminate your understanding of this complex city.  Dalrymple tells the story of a city that has been ruled by Mughals, Sikhs, Hindus, the British and more recently regained its independence.  I read it swiftly.  Pleasant narrator/author, who added depth to the history, by plumping out past historical figures and including current day Delhi-wallahs in their daily life.  I would recommend this novel.	5
I bought Valeo Ultimate blades for my 1999 Toyota Camry. Installation was easy, even though some sort of an explanation on the box on how to remove the old blade would have been appreciated.The blades remove water very well in city driving and at freeway speeds. I do not experience any squeaking, skipping or wind noise problems.The downside, of course, is the price. When the time comes to replace these, most likely, I will go back to regular Toyota wiper inserts since I kept the original wipers. In my opinion, the inserts, when changed regularly, perform just as well.	2
Played it for the first time, after it has been out for over ten years.  Great game.  The puzzles are hard, but not impossible to solve.  If you truly love Myst, then you will certainly love this game.  (Do not use walkthroughs, it ruins the game!)  Also, keep in mind that the 5-CD Riven set is for outdated computers.  It will most likely not run on Vista or XP, at least not without some major glitches.  Wish I had played this sooner.	23
okay so I just got this app for my kindle. I figured it would be some sort of gag thing but now I'm freaking out. I got bored so I said outloud what word am I spelling; p-e-t-e-r. it said a bunch of random words for a while so I turned off my kindle. about five minutes larger I checked it again and the list of words it had said was seven. one of then was Peter!!!!!!!!!! I'm freaking out!!!	1
Pink Moon, Nick Drake's final album before his unfortunate death, is a masterpiece. Recorded during midnight sessions on consecutive nights, Nick Drake sat in a studio with himself and producer Joe Boyd. The only thing that accompanies Drake's voice is the silent playing of his acoustic guitar (and piano on the title track, Pink Moon.) As Drake plunged deeper into depression, he expressed himself by recording the bleak Pink Moon, which stands today as one of the most underrated albums by one of the most underrated singer-songwirters in history. Recommended.	9
"I guess that by now saying that you love music and not be fond of ""Pet Sounds"" is almost a paradox since Brian Wilson's skywritten testament embodies everything that's good about pop music:excellent tunes,lyrics,vocal harmonies and even some flourishes to add a wonderful,dreamy and lush feel to it all.""You still believe in me"",""God only knows"" and ""I know there's an answer"" are certainly among my favorite songs and added proof that good music towers through the decades without losing a trace of its greatness-""Forever Changes"",""Odessey and Oracle"" and ""Pet Sounds""will always be great,come what may."	9
This is a basic pack of loose-leaf paper, nothing in it to overly wow or overly disappoint.  Our paper has all the holes, margins, and lines in the appropriate places, and the lines were dark enough to be visible.  (We&#8217;ve purchased cheaper paper where the lines were almost too faint to see.)  However, if you have a younger writer or someone who puts a lot of pressure on their pen/pencil while writing, this paper may be a bit on the thin side.	17
Freeze dried liver is used by many dog handlers in the show ring.  It doesn't screw up your clothes the way string cheese does.  DOGS LOVE IT !!  Only one problem the chunks are all different sizes from About 3/8&#34; Sq. down to almost dust.  BUT you don't have to waste the scraps, just toss it in their regular food.  It would be nice, however, if they were all a uniform size.  These are about the cheapest I have found.  Five stars for price, convenience and dog's acceptance.  Four stars for crumbling (in transit?)	19
Bore snakes are fantastic. I have one in every caliber I shoot, and even a couple I don't. They are great for a quick clean in between shooting sessions when I don't want to break out the hoppes and patches. I use it every time I shoot my milsurp rifles soaked in windex, as the primers in surplus ammo are often corrisive. If it gets too dirty I just throw them in a laundry bag along with some dirty rags and my mechanic gloves in a small wash cycle. Well worth the small cost for the great utility.	20
"I've used print at home business cards before, and they always left a rough edge.  There was no way around it- you could tell you printed them at home.  I have to say however, that these ""Clean Edge"" business cards are a vast improvement on the past!  To a trained eye, you can still see the edge was that of a tear-away, but they look pretty darn good!  I wouldn't be embarrassed to pass these out, as I was with the older versions."	17
Talk about a kid in a candy store!  I am a pen person, and I think these are my favorite pens ever.  These have:  black, red, pink, blue, aqua, green, and purple.These pens write smoothly and perfectly.  And they are comfortable as far as the grip and the writing and the ease.If I don't have a good pen, the whole day is ruined.  If I only have junky pens, it is a miserable day.I love these pens, both the function and the colors.I keep some at home and some at work.  It is hard to function without good quality pens.	17
This is a very Good game. It is so good. You get to play a lot of diffrent characters, like, Obi-Wan Kenobi, Qui-Gon Jinn, Queen Amidala & Captian Panaka. It woyuld be cool if they let you play Jar Jar Binks, but they don't. Oh, weel. Jar jar is one of my Favorite Characters in the film. the best part is you get to battle darth Maul. and it goes along with the movie too. This game rocks. This is a must have game for all star wars fans.If you liked this game then check out all of the other Star wars games	23
it works well, it's well made, but make sure you realize it has a built in timer. If you camp in your van at night and have a spare battery that you use for things like this and expect you to keep you warm all night you'll wake up an hour later freezing. There is another blanket out there that doesn't have a timer for that purpose. But I keep this one in my boat for rides on chilly days when my mom gets cold. And here the timer is perfect so it doesn't accidentally get left on.	2
Not being, even remotely, a Robert Pattinson fan and not liking circuses either, I put off reading this book for several months after it was purchased.  I still couldn't help visualizing Robert Pattinson as the lead character, but eventually, the story took over and Robert faded a little.  I was pleasantly surprised at how much I really liked the book.  Well written, good story line and a bit of a surprise ending.  Still won't watch the movie (that Robert thing again) but the book is always better anyway.	5
I have three dogs.  Two cocker spaniels and a jack russell terrier.  None of them like this toy.  They have had several Nylabone toys, but this one is the least favorite.  Each of them tried it out, but they all got bored with it fast.  It is very heavy and the points are somewhat sharp.  That may not be what turns my dogs off though because they have had other textured toys.  After handling it myself, I would be worried about it being to coarse and causing bleeding gums or injuring their teeth.	19
I bought this for my 1996 Harley and found this to be the best battery tender. It works great and keeps my battery conditioned over a long Pennsylvania winter! When spring comes my bike's battery is ready to go. I have owned this product for about 2 years and it is great. It is so simple to use and has the connections necessary to use on different batteries. My uncle ended up buying this exact one for his tractor and trolling motor on his boat. He is also impressed by the quality!	2
Considering this was shot in 1972 the video quality is excellent (4:3). Nice sharp (close-up) images with longer shots a little muddled as to be expected with only a few spotlights running during the show. Audio is in its original stereo and sounds OK to pretty good. The performance is stellar but a little short (64 Minutes). It's got a really cool trippy film section about half way through. Far-out. If you like the music of Traffic - get it while you can.	6
Vanity Fair is far from the usual 19th Century novel, most deal with themes of misery, scorn, lost love and dejected women.Becky Sharp in contrast is a go getter of a girl, fueled by her anger at having all the disadvantages of low birth weighing heavy around her neck, she sets a course for the riches and rewards she thinks she deserves with ruthless abandon.Becky is kind of 19th Century Alexis Carrington (Dynasty) and is exqusitely played by Natasha Little who is beautiful, engaging, seductive and a real little monster all at once.	15
"It seems silly to pile more praise on a ""toy"" that has received so much positive feedback; this puzzle/game/toy deserves all of it though.  My son has had this for a couple of years now and it has been a constant source of entertainment.  He pulls it out and it stays out for a week or more before going back on the shelf, and everyone in the family takes a turn at it.  It is a great solitary game, though we have begun to add a timer (a sand filled hour glass works perfectly) just to take it up a notch."	22
I wear these shoes for pretty much everything but running.  As other reviewers have mentioned, these are extremely comfortable with a wide base to provide plenty of traction and grip.  The rubber soles and canvass uppers make them very flexible while still providing some support.  These shoes are great for martial arts as well as normal everyday use.  I often just wear them around the house because they are so comfortable.  They do tend to show sweat stains very easily, but it's understandable being that they're made from white canvass.	20
Today is 10/12/2012 friday and I listened to Clockwork Angels yesterday and already I picked out my favorite tunes.  Snakes and Arrows is where I left off and this is just magic music.  When you grow up with a band what can I say???? even cd's you don't like that much it's still your band.  Caravan BU2B Halo Effect 7 Cities of Gold Headlong Flight Wish Them Well The Garden (the rest too but you get the point) I'm glad everyon's still alive to make music and I'll enjoy them till I'm dead(which I hope aint no time soon)	6
I bought these during Amazon's 4/3 promotion.  I have two golden retrievers who are spoiled badly and I am constantly looking for healthy treats for them.  These are perfect because I can open one package and have one bone for each dog.  They love these and sit waiting for them.  They are not soft but not like rawhide so when they chew on them, it helps clean their teeth.  There are enough vitamins and flavor to keep them interested until the whole bone is gone.  I would definitely buy again.	19
My old salad spinners were cheap.  What a difference a few dollars make!  It does the job extremely well -- it's fast and effecient. This one is much easier to use.  I love the stop feature and the rubberized footing that keeps it stable on the counter.  Dishwasher safe and has a storage lid.  What more could you want.  I've found that the greens keep well in the spinner when you line the basket with paper towels.I enthusiasticly recommend this product to anyone who needs a salad spinner.	13
When I ordered this whisk I was slightly unsure about its usefulness, but I did know my smallest existing whisk was too large to get into the corners of small sauce pans (with straight sides) and too clumsy for whisking a couple of eggs in a small bowl.Oxo has nailed it again.  This whisk reaches into the corners of small pans, is just right for mixing a few eggs or incorporating ingredients into a pan sauce.  The handle is comfortable.  I'm a hero at home for making this purchase.  Thanks Oxo.	13
when I first bought it I was afraid he wouldn't like it, since it wasn't Iron man, or anything of that sort. But he was so excited that he made me write down the table chart for multiples of fives for the living room so he can reference it and find the time. The watch also is glow in the dark! which i didn't know. and its waterproof....he still hasn't taken it off. He said &#34;my daddy has a watch, and now I have a watch. Mine is better though because I have lizards.&#34;	8
I used to own a Mighty Light, which is a very similar vacuum from Eureka.Used that one for about 5-6 years until it finally broke.This thing is slightly stronger and a little louder.This vacuum does a great job getting dust and Cat hair from just about anything(carpet, velvet drapes). Best part is you do not have to run the thing over every inch of the surface (unlike other small canisters), it's powerful enough to suck dust in even when it's in the close proximity.	13
"There are no surprises in this Law and Order series with predictable plots and characters except for a little more sunshine, LA location wise.  Now that ""Criminal Intent"" is off the air and ""SVU"" has become wooden, that is, everyone is phoning in their performances, I don't see this West Coast version coming up with anything fresh.  After a lot of years, I am crying ""Uncle!"".  Not even $1.99 per episode can entice.  I would rather be reading a good book."	0
I put 2 of these along with 2 or 3 decaffeinated Tetley's or PG Tips in a 20-oz mug and make tea every night, usually have 2 of them, and sleep like a baby.  Very soothing.  One thing I have noticed about THIS brand compared to OTHER brands, is that it IS TRULY medicinal.  So, don't overdo it on the Traditional Medicinals (especially the Smooth Move, lol - ain't nothing smooth about that stuff!)  This has a beautiful, fresh/minty but not too minty taste, very soothing.  Have bought more than once.	11
It was a happy ending. He messed up and he groveled a bit for her. He knew what he had done was hurtful to her and he had to build up her trust. I was satisfied with the effort he made to win her back. This is not a cheating book but a family that did not approve of his love for her, so they got rid of her. A deathbed confession and I was hooked. I was just going to read a chapter and go to sleep but finished the book.	14
Apparently, Jockey makes different styles of underwear for sale in stores and online in packages.  I got what I thought looked identical to ones I got at JCPenney--every detail was the same, the fiber contents were the same--and when I got them, they were not the same.  They do fit pretty well--but not as well as the others I have.  They are not soft and silky and stretchy like the ones I got at the store.  They are really thick, and so a little hot for summer and they don't have a lot of stretch.	8
I would give Californication another star but Amazon for some reason took it off of Prime while I was in the middle of season 1!  Why did you do that, Amazon??  I thought the series was smart, sexy and fun and you obviously did that so consumers would buy the rest of the season.  Maybe it was because it was streaming for free but Californication wasn't great enough for me to justify paying $2 per episode when it was once free.  Sorry to go on so long about this but it really bugs me.  Shame on you, Amazon!	0
The game never gets old with it's many rides and many levels Atari did a great job putting this game together. Creating a prk is a blast. I love it. There is unlimited rides, Rollercoasters, and food accommodations. It teaches you the value of a dollar. Very good teaching skills. Once you start it you won't stop with it's wonderful game play. Wonderful Graphics. Wonderful story line this game is the best of the best. Awesome, Wonderful, Fantastic. Brovo!!!!!!!	23
Easy to grip and handle.  Low on vibration and noise.  Lets you get right up next to areas you don't want sanded with full sanding capability to the very edge.  Beats anything I've owned so far for controllability and ability to get in tight corners and edge sand on fine work.The ONLY complaint I've got is with the dust collection system.  The bag tends to jump off on anything you're doing that isn't flat and horizontal.  And a vacuum attachment would be greatly appreciated, too.But, I'd buy it again, even with that shortcoming.	21
I use this to power a Big Muff Pi, mxr compresser, Ibanez Tube Screamer, and a Planet Waves tuner pedal. The only pedal I have that it won't power is a digitech whammy, but that was expected when I bought it.  It works great. I use the 9-volt battery adapter to power the Big Muff and it even works perfect. I get no extra hum with the 4 pedals and it only takes up one spot in my surge protector. Great little power source. I'm not sure I'd use it for professional gigs, but great for home use.	16
Of course everyone has a different response to treatments but this has been the go to gel for minor scraps & bruises for the family.It's amazing as upon immediate application its soothes the wound and eases pain,all while healing and lessening the presence of a scar.It's a must for first aide kits and medicine cabinets especially if you have kids.I even used it on minor burns and yes, it works like a charm.Gr8 product!!Also if you have body aches,cramps or muscle pain try arnica tabletsArnica Montana 30x 250 Tabletsnow these little tablets out weigh any other pain relief tablet OTC.	12
Very easy to setup and though I have never done stairs before I was able to finish my stairs (cutting and fitting) in one afternoon.  It was a total of 19 treads and risers.  My neighbor had a pro do his stairs.  Took the pro over 3 weeks as he cut the boards wrong and they had to reorder the treads.  He came over to see mine thought my stairs were done much better.  Doing stairs, get it.  Ignore whiney reviews about quality.  The shipping tube it comes in will protect it.	21
This is one of the most fun books I have read.  From page 1 all the way thru. I have laughed out loud at so many points and then sad at others. This is a fantastic read. I usually don't like to read women authors, Tess Gerritson and Alex Kava are the exceptions, but Sara has done a great, great job. I can hardly wait now to see the movie. I hope Sara had a lot to do with writing the movie script.  So many really good books stories are ruined when it comes to be a movie.	5
These are a must-have item. Heretofore, I've been using the Planet waves strap with a straplock mechanism. While it's an innovative system that doesn't require any installation, the plastic ends are large and a bit awkward and can get in the way of things.I installed the Schallers on my Warmoth Strat body -- I found that I needed to add some toothpick pieces per the recommendations of others to achieve a super tight fit -- not a big deal at all. These Schallers are exactly what I wanted. 5 stars, and a no-brainer.	16
It seems every year Hollywood dumps out a movie that is some combination of zombies, alien invasion, gory violence, gunplay and swordfighting all rolled into one.  For 2008, this was Mutant Chronicles, a movie about an ancient alien device that is re-awakened by WWIII and starts to turn mankind into zombies.  An international crew of soldiers, both guys and gals, are teamed up to destroy, or at least turn of, the alien device.  The movie has nothing special about its plot, dialogue, or even special effects.  All in all, a waste of almost 2 hours.	0
I bought them for my husband, as I read about them on some blog about a man's kitchen or masculine cooking utensils.  They're all that.  He looks 4 inches taller when using them... and he can finally stop using a spoon and his fingers to pull the last carrots out of the stir fry.I hook them over the edge of our wooden-spoon jar.  The tab at the top locks them in a mostly closed position... making them less obnoxious to store than similar products.	13
Although the fit was good and the bra itself was comfortable, I returned this bra due to the uncomfortable &#34;buckle&#34; type adjuster on the strap.  I could constantly feel it digging into my shoulder blades.  Since I wear this type of bra all day (not for sports), the straps have to be comfortable.  Instead I'm keeping the Lily of France Sport in Action sports bra.  The straps aren't adjustable but fit fine on me and feel divine compared to the Natori straps.	8
This is a well written short novella. It is very interesting how the whole city and its very particular characteristics are depicted with precise yet spare language.A lady arrives to Cougar Falls, a place that is not in the maps to inherit her aunt property. It turns out she also inherits the responsibility about the fate of the city. There is romance, some fights, a bit of suspense.There are some steamy scenes, f/m and and a lady with three brothers.The whole story is interesting, and the door to a series; it does work standalone. Good for a fast read.	14
It is perfect to secure your spare tire to tire carrier or bumper. Easy to use and sturdy. Is not a eyesore, and seems well made, i highly recommend this to keep thieves honest, it wont guarentee a determined thief wont steal your expensive wheel/tire, but when the thief see's the steel cable wrapped through the wheel, it won't be so much a snatch and grab. Some piece of mind to myself. I run 31.10.50 x 15&#34; wheels (over $350 each wheel/tire x 5 = $1750), with a Smitybilt tire carrier, the 36&#34; cable was plenty long enough.	2
I wear a large sized glove, so assuming that would translate, I got these.  While I can force it over my thumb, it is very tight and uncomfortable (i.e., pinches).  My thumbs don't have a particularly excessive diameter either.  I'm gonna try to heat these so I can stretch them a bit.  I know they need to be snug so the pick doesn't rotate when being used, but this is ridiculous.  Three stars because if they fit you, it is a nice pick (it would be 5 if they were described correctly for sizing).	16
You can get combo squares for 1/10 the price of this Starrett but if you do a lot of work with one you will instantly love this (or any Starrett). Extremely well made. The blade is super durable and very easy to read. If you have ever fumbled with others when trying to reinsert the blade back into the head you'll love the way Starrett's furled nut/ locking system works. Very precise and holds the 90/45 extremely well. The lock bolt is very sturdy, operates smoothly, and will not fall out.	21
This is one of the best television min-series that I have watched. It is one of those shows where you feel that you know the characters personally. Set in pre WW-I London, there are funny and sad episodes capturing the different emotions of people from different classes. For me, my favorite characters were Mr. Richard Bellamy, Lady Marjorie, Mrs. Hazel Bellamy (Upstairs) and all the characters (Mrs. Bridges, Mr. Hudson, Rose, Edward, Ruby, Sarah) from Downstairs.This set has subtitles, but the diction is clear and easy to understand. Overall I'm glad I brought this set.	15
"Season 4 is one of the best from start to finish. David Suchet's portrayal brings to life Agatha Christie's Belgian detective; unlike any actor before him. He is to Poirot, what Jeremy Brett was to Sherlock Holmes. These are three of the longer; not to mention some of the best episodes; with ""Death in the Clouds"" and ""One, Two, Buckle My Shoe"" taking top honors. I highly recommend this season to anyone needing a bit intellectual entertainment, you won't be disappointed."	0
This cd was the essence of the ska/punk genre, this cd definateley represents the best of the ska/punk mix as well.  Then to top it all off Tragic Kingdom is No Doubt's best release out of all of their albums.  From songs such as Don't Speak and Spiderwebs, Gwen shows off her amazingly strong voice, and does it very well.  From the punk riffs, to the bright ska sound from the horn players No Doubt made a huge impression on the world of music.	9
"If I ever need another pet food container I will be purchasing this brand again! It's wonderful. Not only is it air tight, but the lid is very easy to open one-handed while you hold the dog food bowl in your other hand. I know that one complaint was that her cat knocked the storage container off the counter and it broke and all I can say is ""Duhhhh, don't put the container on your counter."" It should be on the floor in the pantry or elsewhere. It's very sturdy and holds an entire large bag of dog food. PERFECT!"	19
"I have to agree with one of the earlier reviewers:  the complete ""videos"" on this tape are fantastic, but the narrated voice-over (delivered in a near-monotone) during the opening bits isn't of much use.  Still, I use portions of this tape in my Jazz History class, and at least the narration backs up the info that students are given in their textbooks.  In all, I like certain clips in here better than the Burns ""Jazz"" anthology simply because they ARE complete."	6
ive had the mount for a couple weeks and so far it works great. I read some of the other reviews saying it shakes which i dont know how you could avoid that since the whole car is moving. it hasent fallen down or anything. So far it does what it says. it is cheap but thats to be expected for the price. my only complaint was putting it together was annoying. other then that it really is FINE I sell these at my job that are the same quality for 30$ or more so really its not THAT bad.	7
This stuff kicks butt on Staph and ugly friends.I get a staph infection now and then on my stomach area around the button. I don't know why. Doctor does not know why. I pour a little in my hand and scrub it up and rinse it down.I do this about 3 times, in three days and after about a week the skin irritation is completely gone. Stupid doctor wants to put me on antibiotics. NO! An apple a day keeps the doctor away and two apples a day keeps his greedy partner away too!Use sparingly.	12
"My 20 month old German Shepherd shredded Mr. Bill in less than two weeks. Oh! He loved the toy and always kept him close, even sleeping with him. However, for a reason known only to ""Igor"", he got carried away one day and shredded Mr. Bill into microscopic pieces. I managed to salvage the voice box, but Mr. Bill has no body now to go with his voice. However, since Mr. Bill was a favorite and is reasonably priced, I have ordered Igor yet another one for his Xmas stocking."	19
I got these for my husband to play golf in (he's a boxer lover and not boxer-briefs) The photo on the model doesn't accurately show it these fit my husband (looser around the thighs and he's got muscular thighs). He wore them one day and has asked me to order enough to throw out ALL of his old boxers from different brands. Super light weight, feels great against his skin, wicks sweat, keeps him cool. He's a 36-38 waist and I got him a Large.	8
This external USB DVD/CD drive is perfect for netbooks and laptops needing an external drive to handle CDs and DVDs.  The drive itself is slim and light, ready to travel with your netbook.  It conveniently draws its operating power through the connecting cord to a netbook or laptop USB port.  Assuming your laptop or netbook has a media player, you should be ready to utilize this drive right out of the box.  The drive is not necessarily ruggedized, so some care with handling is advisable. Highly recommended.	10
I only used this a handful of times before the connector wasn't making a strong connection to the phone any longer.  When that happens, my phone will charge only if I hold the cable to the phone and everything is aligned perfectly.  Otherwise, as the car hits bumps, it might charge for a minute and then not charge for a minute.  And yes, it's the cable and not the phone.  This is one of the problems with buying an integrated charger/cable unit... when the cable connector goes bad, the charger becomes useless.  And it does appear to be a genuine Motorola product.	7
I have to say with each season I'm more and more impressed by the wholesome fun that is Curious George.  This series has become a stable of one of my daughter's days and my wife and I enjoy watching it with her.  Primarily it is fun, engaging, and full of wholesome morality and lessons, such as: forgiveness, patience, understanding, loyalty, creativity, obedience and others.  I'm not espousing this show is the end all, be all...to teach your child, but they (and you) will have a lot of fun together watching and explaining as you go.  :-)	0
I mostly use the spear type jags, as opposed to the slotted ones, and find that thicker patches are too tight fitting. For slotted jags, a bigger thicker patch is good. I've found that it's good to have an assortment of patches for different purposes. These are good for cleaning the bore with a spear type jag. Twill is strong and good for scrubbing internal parts. Flannel is soft and absorbent but can leave lint behind and is good for external parts. Anyway, that's how I use them.	20
Hi I have a Kindle Fire and also have a 6 year old grandson. We are always looking for games to play. I am always looking for thinking games to play and Checkers is a great beginner for a little one to test their skills. I deleted the game not because we didn't like it but my grandson plays other games. So please it's a great game for any age you can play against the computer or 2 player. Try it I am sure you will enjoy playing it. And of course it's free!	1
"Even people who say ""I only read nonfiction"" can enjoy this entertaining novel, which is rich with fascinating details about life in a traveling circus during Prohibition and the Depression. For example, circus members stocked up on booze in Canada and sneaked it across the border into the US  by storing it in the middle of the train car carrying camels, because camels spit, and customs agents didn't want to mingle with them. Against an unusual background, the fictional characters (humans and other animals) weave a story that keeps readers turning the pages."	5
I have tried almost every sync app out there for android.  My criteria are that it must sync ratings both ways, work with smart play lists in iTunes, sync play counts, and be user friendly.  I found nothing else even close to this app.  I use the WiFi sync add-on with this. I once had a problem with a non US phone, and the developers fixed the problem immediately.  Very responsive.  Bought it here in Amazon because the other market doesn't work when I travel...  No complaints after almost 1 year.	1
This bra is extremely comfortable, affordable and pretty too! My only complaint, and the reason for 4 stars is that the straps can't be adjusted very much. Right now as it is I'm at maximum shortening of the straps, so as I wear it and it stretches I can see some adjustments in my future. Nothing my sewing machine can't fix though. All in all I'd recommend to someone like me whose been searching for a comfortable yet pretty bra for their girls (I'm 32GG).	8
I had not recently tried organic raw honey so I was not sure what to expect, regardless, I did not expect this.  The taste is unbelievable, sweet yet not cloying- nothing else tastes quite like it.  The texture is also a nice surprise in that it's slightly creamy but with more body and texture than a typical processed spread like Nutella.Take a piece of high quality dense bread like Ezekiel bread, lightly toast it to bring out the nuttiness, then liberally apply a swab of raw honey to make a little piece of heaven on earth- delicious!	11
This is great honey - very nice flavor, very mild, great to use in baking, on rice cakes, in coffee or tea... all around great organic honey...  I put the jar in the microwave to make it more runny, because it doesn't come that way.  If you are going to put in tea or coffee, or spread on rice cakes, its fine as it is - but need to make it runny if you are going to bake with it, so you can pour into a measuring cup...	11
I often make oversized prints of my photographs and to save money and time I'll have my local office supply store print them on good quality stock that is often not perfectly sized to the print. I use this unit to make super-clean straight cuts. It is not a heavy duty machine but it could handle 5-6 sheets easily.Be warned though that the more sheets in a stack to cut, the greater the chance that the edges will not be precise. If you need it perfect, do one sheet at a time.	17
I mixed a capful of this Vitamin E oil with a cup of coconut oil in a plastic bottle and use a little each night as a moisturizer before I go to bed. My skin is dry but this doesn't goop it up at all. My skin absorbs it quickly and leaves my face feeling smooth and hydrated. i also mix this into my hair oil mix (Black Castor, Coconut, Jojoba) and it has worked wonders. This is always good to have on hand, the smaller bottle is best since it doesn't stay fresh forever.	12
Hmm. I thought I already did a review on this, but I guess I didn't.I'm very much the novice at sprouting so this is the first one I've tried and I really like the combination.It has the right sweet/hot spicy kick to it and I find myself putting it on almost everything.I sprout using filtered, ionized water and have had great success, I think, so no complaints there as I think using tap water, which even plants and animals don't want, surely wouldn't do well for sprouts. Just my opinion.Happy.	11
This is the only car racing game you every need.  It can be taught in minuets to new players.  The game is at its heart a dice rolling game, so some of the decisions are out of your control but there is still enough strategy to make it feel like you are in control of your car.  The extra tracks are a most, the Germany and Spain expansion are very good tracks.  This is one of the few games that can play up to 10 players, which is super fun.	22
Very comfy seat, I am 6' and 215lbs.  I fish out in the ocean, sometimes 50 miles from shore, and when ya gotta go, well, you know the story.  Before we were using a 5 gallon bucket with no seat and it can be uncomfortable and leave a ring around  your behind.  This seat fit my generic 5 gallon  bucket very snugly, AND, is comfortable to sit on. My crew and I are now, &#34;HAPPY CAMPERS,  I mean, &#34;HAPPY FISHERPEOPLE&#34;.	20
I purchased the Fobus Holster on Sunday and received it on Thursday.  I was nervous about the holster because all I have heard is to buy Uncle Mike's Holsters at $60 to $80 bucks.  This Holster fits my .45 Glock 30sf PERFECTLY.  As long as you have a sweater on or something baggy its great.  Its a little big for a T-Shirt but hey, the Glock itself is a fat little gun.  This holster will be perfect for the range and the gun fits in it nicely.  I highly recommend this holster.	20
I had to use quite a stack of wood blocks under my travel trailer (TT) jack because I've had the axles flipped on it.  It sits about 4 inches higher than when it was stock.  When I saw this recommended by Amazon I was all over it.  I still use a few blocks of wood along with this just to further minimize the amount of jack travel required.  I would have given it 5 stars if I didn't have to remove the foot from the jack in order to use it.	2
I've owned this video for several years and spent several years trying to track it down and persisted because this video takes one on a mental journey where you lose yourself completely in the imagery and the sounds in a visual trip accentuated by the brilliant experimentation in music created by Pink Floyd in their earlier years.  If you are a serious Pink Floyd fan this video is a must have that for me rivals &quot;The Wall&quot; but in a very different direction that is just as unique and profound in the creative genius of Pink Floyd.	6
These are weights so not much to say about them or what you're supposed to do with them.  They are high quality metal plates so should last a lifetime easily.  Anyway, the idea here is to buy them to save some money.  The prices fluctuate a lot so you need to pay attention and be patient.  It's really nice having these shipped to your door because it saves a lot of time and these can of course get heavy, being a bit awkward to carry with you.	20
What a fabulous Undone!! I loved it! Knowing this short story is a delicious appetizer for The Diamonds of Welbourne Manor by Diane Gaston, Amanda McCabe, and Deb Marlowe made it even better. There's more!From the moment I met Margaret Lewis I was cheering for her, and I fell in love with Captain Graham Veall before he walked onto the page. My heart broke for Graham, and yet Margaret was simply perfect for him. And I just about burst into tears at the end. This is why I love romance stories. *wild applause*	14
"Avery never fails to produce quality, easy to use labels and these are no exception.  As with any Avery label, these work seamlessly with the templates built into Word.  This particular type with ""TrueBlock Technology"" and be pasted right over previous labels so envelopes and boxes can be reused without having to peel off the old label.  They guarantee nothing will show through (like an old bar code) and mess up your shipment.  Nice feature and very ""green""  which I always appreciate!  Kudos, Avery!"	17
"This album made NxD famous. It made Gwen Stefani into a star.The first four tracks on the album set the scene. The whole album is represented by those tracks.The rest of the album is amazing, but some of the songs go over your head. But that just gives this album more replay value.I hope NxD release their new album soon. Till then fans, myself included, have ""Tragic Kingdom"" and the acclaimed ""Rock Steady"" to tide them over.Favorite tracks: ""Spiderwebs,"" ""Excuse Me Mr."" ""Just a Girl,"" ""Happy Now?"" ""Sunday Morning,"" ""Don't Speak"""	9
The non-stick bottom and handle to this bowl make mixing so much easier.  On my countertop, and water makes the bowl slip.  But the gripping bottom on this bowl resists slipping, making mixing easier.Unlike some other bowls, this one also has a non-stick handle.  Frankly, my hands get wet more often than my countertop, so the non-stick handle may turn out to be more helpful than the base.The 2 quart size is just about perfect for mixing simple sauces or marinades.Remember, this bowl is just about unbreakable too!You will love this bowl.	13
Despite the hefty price tag and prestigious name, this saw won't hold a blade! My first one wouldn't... and neither would the replacement Home Depot gave me. Nothing I did would make a blade stay in. Call to the factory elicited this comment: &quot;Yeah, we get a lot of complaints about that.&quot;  Duh! Tried it one last time and -- the motor went out!  I finallly bought the top-of-the-line Craftsman (made by Bosch) and no such problems -- it's a honey.	21
I love this stuff.I've been using it in 2 ways:- I add this into my baking to make a more moist, cake-like texture- I use it with fresh juices to make real-juice jello from scratch.Wow.  Every time I use it, my body loves it.  Granted, this is a healing food for adrenal fatigue, which I have.  But each time I eat the gelatin / jello I prepared with this, my body craves more of it.For sure will re-order.  Highly recommended.	11
I don't know why I picked up this book to read, but I'm glad I did!  All summer, I've become bored with other books I've attempted to read but abandoned half way through.Water for Elephants was different.  Once I started reading, I couldn't put the book down.  The author did a great job developing the characters and the story.  I didn't know much about circus life and the story gives the reader a good glimpse of what it was like.  Because I'm an animal lover, I liked how the main character looked out for well being of the circus animals.I recommend this book.	5
I used to use something like this all the time when I worked in a deli, but I find it useful at home all the time. It's great as a pastry cutter and helps get veggies from cutting board to cooking vessel in bulk. I haven't tried chopping anything with but maybe for bread or pizza dough it could be pretty good.The handle is a little wide / awkward to use tho, I think it would have been better if it was a little taller and thinner then so short and round. I think it's just personal preference tho.	13
I bought this Texsport bag to store myGuide Gear Double Wigwam Tent.  This bag is huge and is big enough for my 8-man tent with room to spare.  The only thing I don't like is it doesn't come with a strap.  There are plastic loops where we can attach a strap, but we must supply our own straps.  It does come with carry handles and a zipper down the middle, which I like more than the ones that open on the end.This is one tough bag.  Great for camping.  I'm glad I found it.	8
The Bankers Box File Medium-Duty Storage Boxes with Lift-Off Lid almost put themselves together&#8230;well the box part anyway. The lid is a bit of a puzzle, but by no means hard to do. I have a large, second-hand file cabinet and I've been thinking why not just have a couple of bankers boxes. They will be easier to move and sure take up less space. These are pretty good sized. Ones that are a little less long may be more practical, if you have to move them often. These are really great bankers boxes.	17
I drink all kinds of non-black decaf teas.  A friend of mine brought some of this Wild Sweet Orange for me to try.  OMG!  Just the smell from the teabag is delicious!  And that incredible taste carries over into the actual brewed tea (unlike coffee, for example, where the beans smell incredible but then you brew them and it's just ..eh.).  It's the smell and flavor of a ripe orange - without any acidity.  It's simply delicious.  Anyway, as soon as I tried it, I bought a box.  And then another.  I love it.	11
This speed loader works for 6 shot 45 colt revolvers, such as the Governor. Any negative reviews I have seen for this are due to consumers lack of knowledge. To clear up issues from previous reviews: 1. Of course this six shot cartridge holder will not fit your five shot revolver. 2. The number 25-5 is a model number, nothing more. 3. No, 410 shells and 45 ACP rounds will not work in this speed loader. Only 45 colt. I have several speed loaders for different calibers by this company and have never had any issues.	20
I replaced the Schaller strap locks on my Strat with these. The Schaller ones ground on the connecting hardware to the point where I had to oil them a few times a month or I'd end up with an audible creak.Hands-down I like the Dunlop ones more. They installed in just a few minutes and the guitar feels very secure. No problems whatsoever. I just ordered my third set a few minutes ago.I'm a total convert - every new guitar I get is going to get a set of these put on it.	16
I used to break out in boils and get rashes underneath my breasts due to the hot humid weather in Florida.  I use this tea tree creme daily underneath my breasts and it helps keep my skin free from rashes and boils.  I used to have a reoccurring chronic problem with boils and the prescription medicines never completely cured my boil problem.  I started using this creme and I now have been boil free for over a year due to this product.  I highly recommend this product for boils and rashes.	4
I have tried several different brands/types of tuners in my 13 years of playing. I have found that this model fits my needs perfectly. It quickly detects the tune, dynamically changes as you turn the tuning pegs, and is extremely accurate. It also has options to tune flat, sharp, guitar, bass, etc.It is also small and portable. I have one in EACH of my 12 guitar cases and it fits into the accessory pockets/pouches perfectly. I cant recommend this tuner enough.As always, please indicate if this review was helpful and keep on rockin'	16
Simply put, this speaker turned my Super Champ XD into a killer 15watt amp. Gave the amp more low-end and made everything much clearer. I would, and do, recommend this speaker to anyone wanting to upgrade their Super Champ sound. And, like other people have said, the speaker is much louder on the same volume setting. I had to turn the amp down two notches (two number) to have the same volume level out of the amp.If my Super Champ was stolen, I'd buy a new one and put this speaker in it. Wouldn't even think twice about it.	16
We have used Frontline on our dog her entire life (she just turned 5) and it works great.  We spend a lot of time outdoors with her so our primary concern is ticks.  This past weekend we were up in North Dakota with her and my Dad and his dog - my dad's dog had on another tick control product and we found over a dozen ticks on him each night but our dog never had more than 2.  I think the ticks would have died and fallen off if we hadn't found them first.	19
This is a nice, light weight tool for trimming small branches high in trees and shrubs.  It easily cuts branches up to 1/2 inch.  The only reason I did not give it a five star rating is my experience with other Fiskars' tools with the same type of adjustable head. The head is a weak point, after a few months of use my experience is that the plastic head will fail.  Even though it has a lifetime warranty; returning for repairs is just too difficult to be worth the trouble.	18
After even a quick wash, my hair feels too squeaky and crispy. On one hand it can be an indication of the shampoo doing a good job cleansing the hair. On the other hand, it feels like it washes off all the oils that my scalp needs. When I dry my hair it looks too lifeless and just sticks up because it lacks any weight... I've never had my hair thinner. And yes, I use the conditioner of the same brand after every wash, but it doesn't help.	4
I have always loved this game.  I used to play Mastermind for hours with my siblings.  Now, I have shared this game with my kids.  We got this new version since my original game has been long lost.  This version seems to have some design flaws though.  The storage compartment is difficult to close and is always getting pegs stuck in the tiny holes on the side.  I have given up using it and store the pieces in a separate bag.  Also, it is hard for adult fingers to put pegs into the code maker section.  Otherwise, it is a terrific game.	22
An interesting concept, I didn't even know it was on broadcast TV when it was.  I think too much time was spent on Ron Livingston's soulful looks, and Laura Harris is getting too old to be simpering like an ingenue.  The flashbacks started getting irritating, too-why not just start at the beginning?  By the time I finished watching the season, I was kind of glad there wasn't a second season, though I might have watched it just to see what they'd do with the &#34;baby&#34;.	0
I love this book.The writing is fresh, the humor sneaky and the plot is nothing like a standard old paranormal. My only complaint is I wish it was longer, but Treanor does manage to make me care about Anna and Joe. I don't have a problem with an assassin hero in this, and even better Joe never turns into a typical domesticated reformed man--he keeps his edge of danger.I thought I'd be squicked because, hey, she lusts after a crash test dummy .... but the heat works really well.After I read it, Marie Treanor went on my autobuy list and she hasn't disappointed me yet.	14
Bought this after getting beat in a woodworking competition where a decorated gunstock beat out one of my guitars using Tru-oil. Bought a 20 oz. bottle and found it incredibly easy to layer up, dries comparatively fast, and is much harder than lacquer. Found bulk disposable non-linting application towels for application and basically put my spray equipment away for guitars.  Just great stuff, and it takes very little to put on a coat. Takes 7-8 coats to get glassy. Polishes well with clear coat swirl polish. Just outstanding stuff.	20
The first time I saw &#34;An American Christmas Carol&#34; I immediately fell in love with it.  I didn't grow up during the Great Depression but my father did and he told stories that made it real for me.  This re-imagination of an Americanized Scrooge during the Depression is wonderful.  The story, acting, directing, camera work, costumes, sets, locations, music, and all production values are great.  I have always enjoyed Henry Winkler as an actor, but I think this is by far one of his best if not the best performance of his career to date.  I highly recommend it for the whole family.CA Luster	15
Because I like both history and historical fiction, I opted to watch this video and I'm very glad I did. Sometimes there was too much violence and sex, but history tells us that those were the two chief components of the Roman Empire. The BBC did an excellent job of presenting the positive side of Roman life as well--architecture, art, public works. The thought went through my mind: it's better to read it than live it. Then came the news broadcasts on TV and I'm wondering just how close we are to actually living it in 2014. Rather scary thought.	0
For the price, you cannot go wrong with one or even two of these.  They truly are made for indoor flying but after some practice you'll want backups to fly while the others are charging!  I have noticed though that after about 40-50 full flights the battery doesn't last long.  Also, DO NOT overcharge.  When the indicator says the battery is full, unplug it.  A friend ruined 2 of his leaving them charged in overnight.  As long as you take care of it charging and disconnecting it (which takes about 45-55 minutes) it will reward you with ALOT of fun.	22
My razor is again performing like new.  I am well satisified with these heads. They cut at least as well as the heads supplied with the razor.One thing I have learned is that I can't go a year between replacing the heads.  Fortunately Amazon now offers a program to send the item each time interval, up to 6 months, that you specify.  I signed up for this to be sure that I will get new heads every 6 months for a price below the listed price and with shipping free.	12
We like Avent brand nipples bc they are durable and not overly flexible. My son is teething and these nipples hold up well amidst his chewing/gumming. Nipples are not as flexible as other brands (Playtex for example) which helps against excess dripping when my son wolfs his formula down. These do seem to be a slightly slower flow than other medium level nipples however. We have &#34;up sized&#34; Avent nipples quicker than other brands. These nipples also seem to work well w my son's reflux. Will continue to purchase.	3
Neither of these chargers worked with any of the ipods in our house -- not the iPod touch, not the iPhone, and not the iPod Classics.It has been my experience with off-brand chargers that sometimes they will actually be charging even though the charge light does not light and sometimes that the item will work if you wiggle the connection or throw salt over your shoulder while attempting to get it to work.  Nothing made these work.I left each item connected for between 8-24 hours, each, to find out if any of the ipods charged and they didn't.	7
This was an amazing game when I first got it... a million years ago or so.  Funny thing is, they were talking about Diablo 2 in developement back then, but I didn't see it for at least another 2 and a half years...If you happen to be running a computer that is older than dirt, go ahead and buy this game, I think it is great, but it is way past it's time.  As a matter of fact, I think I saw someone playing it the last time I was in Amish country.	23
3 1/2The fearless instrumental group of experimental math-rockers blazed a small but distinct trail across this subgenre, layering drumkit assaults after angular riffs in a more intimidating way then most of their peers could ever imagine. Even early on, when the group often felt more controlled experiment then experimental control, a rhythmic complexity, anchored by an amazing, ever-questing drummer, never eludes the at-times fascinating interplay. The last few tracks helped rein in these overwhelmingly spastic hardcore jam sessions with a little more melodic development, hinting at further greatness to come.	9
I became a big fan of body wash when I realized how much more efficiently I can get through a shower.  I then decided I wanted to get something that was less perfume filled and would keep from feeling like I just bathed in my deodorant. Dr. Bronner's was an excellent choice, it doesn't dry my skin, it rinses clean and it's supposed to break down better, meaning it's better for the environment.  I also can get about 6 months out of the 32oz container, a little goes a very, very long way.	20
I got this toy after reading reviews of other parents and thinking my 5 year old son would enjoy it.  He loves to build and put things together, but this does not hold his interest what so ever.  He put 2 of the wheels on and snapped the base together and has not touched it since.  The biggest problem I have with this is that it smells like it was stored in a musty/moldy warehouse.  The box can be smelled from several feet away and it is not pleasant.  It kind of makes me feel like the whole thing is dirty.	22
I have been using Purpose products ever since I was a teen.  I used to have acne and dry skin and needed a product that I could use to moisturize my face.  Because my face is sensitive I would always break out but when the dermotologist recommended this product I was elated and am still using it to this day.  It does what it needs to do to keep my face moisturized and looking young.  I am 55 now and still have smooth beautiful skin.  I recommend this product to anyone who has sensitive skin.	4
I read good reviews about these strings on mylespaul.com and around the web and bought a set locally for the same price. I usually use DR Tite Fits, but these made me change for good They have a lot of mids and bass and make for a great chunky blues and classic rock sound with P90's. I also used a set on a single coil stray cigar box guitar I built and they give a lot of resonance and life to the old box and cheapo pickup. I will buy another set, DR strings never disappoint.	16
Thin, crispy, perfectly baked - - the best saltine cracker out there.  The flavor is subtle, the texture is very delicate, and there's not a hint of that &#34;stale&#34; taste most grocery-store saltines are cursed with these days.  Crumble 'em up for a great breading for fish, chicken, or pork chops.  Smash 'em into your soup for a great thickening agent that doesn't overstep the flavor of even the most delicate vegetable-based soups or consomm&eacute;'s.  We used to buy these many moons ago, but they're no longer available in our local grocery stores.  Thanks, Amazon!	11
I have at least one cup of this every day.. Someone said it would help clean out your liver.. I hope so, though I do not know.. But, on faith, I am trying it.. And, so far, so good, no issues.. But, what is an issue is that I have to plan further ahead.. The brewing time for a bag of this is fifteen minutes.. So, if you are interested, I think this is a good choice, but it does take extra time to brew...	11
Just finished this wonderfully colorful novel & I was not disappointed.....Once I started reading,I could NOT put it down...Loved the circus setting,strong characters and animals...Now I cannot wait to see the movie...One of the best stories I have read all year....And the author very realistically portrays what it actually means to get older...I'm not as old as the elder Jacob yet but each year that goes by,I can tell the difference in the physical abilities....If you are looking for entertainment,this book will provide it.	5
The Sega VMU is simply amazing. It is not just a memory card, but it also shows the last time you used your game, a clock and games that you can download of Sega Net. It also has a great LCD screen which you can use to choose your plays in football games so your friends don't cheat. The only problem is the battery power is weak and it the VMU only holds 200 blocks which is just enough to save one Sega Sports 2K2. The Sega VMU is still a great deal...	23
This a very good tool and cuts very nicely. I agree that it does a nice job cutting, however, I give it 4 stars because the handles are a bit weak looking and flex easily when trying to cut live branches that approach 3 inches, and I am afraid I will snap the handle if I put too much pressure. That happens when the handles are fully extended or not...so 4 stars. With that said, it works as advertised. It can be locked closed. Be careful and it should get the job done relatively easily. I just wish the handles were sturdier.	18
For making square pieces (doors, frame panels, boxes, etc) these clamps are the best.  The jaw faces stay parallel to each other, which helps keep everything lined-up and the plastic does not mar the wood.Any wood glue that squeezes out of the joints does not stick to the plastic nor the metal.These clamps will stand on the floor on their back without any other support.  You can also clamp up panels and stand them up and the clamps are stable that way too!They are a few dollars more, but definitely worth it.  They are heavy, so get some small ones too.	21
Now that I've finally learned to read and follow directions, I know why a couple of shredders crapped out on me so quickly.  Every time I empty the waste bucket, I spray a bit of this lube on the cutters, and run them forward and reverse.  So far, my latest shredder is running smooth as silk, with this simple bit of prevent. maintenance.The oil itself seems very good, no smell or spatter when I'm lubing the cutters.  And a little bit goes a long way.	17
The book was well written and the characters interesting.I felt as if the story began in the middle and the female character was not developed fully.... I kept waiting for her to take hold of her situation as when the story began she was a feisty young think making it on her own but...Some aspect of the story the reader was left to deduce or perceive but thats ok too as it made me totally focus on the story rather than skimming through to the more action packed scenes.I wander what happened after this book ended???? hint, hint	14
I rescued a cute little dog. Well, after a few days, I found that she had ticks.  I have never had a dog with ticks before so I did not know what to do. I probably did not have problems before as my dogs always had Frontline to keep them flea free. I bought this and immediately started the applications. It took a few weeks but now I rarely find any on her and when I do, most of the time they are dead or almost dead. I feel the product does what it is suppose to do.	19
My wife got these in the supermarket as one of her websites told her that these will help boost the milk supply during breastfeeding. They were right! when we ran out she was producing 3-4 oz less each day! Not good! I ordered this on amazon and splurged for the next day delivery. Amazon's price of this was the same price as the grocery store. However the grocery store gives you 30 count and this is 180...Can't say what else you would use Fenugreek for, but... it sure helps increase milk supply!	11
I was so happy when I found this. It is the best brand of no fat hot chocolate around. So finding it in bulk was surprising since I only see the 8 individual pack variety in grocery store. Getting it in bulk has made me experimental with it. For example, I have even tried it in plain milk to make chocolate milk, and it works pretty well, too. I've also put a ready made hot one in the freezer to have a cold chocolate. At 20 calories a serving, this can't be beat for value both monetarily and caloric-ally.	11
If you have never tried Sudoku, or don't understand the game, or are simply frustrated by it, this is a great way to learn! Levels run from easy through extreme, and you can &#34;pencil&#34; in possible values for the empty boxes by rotating the small pencil icon at the bottom diagonally, as well as &#34;erase&#34; entries that no longer fit.

Yes, these strings are amazing.  I discovered these on my new Taylor and now I've put them on all my gits.  They really are the better string.  I was a fan of Ernie Ball on my electrifieds and D'Addario on my acoustics, but no more, I'm only using these.  They are brighter in tone to me and that really brightens up my acoustics.  They bend easy so they are nice on the electrics.  They do, however, seem to take a little more breaking in than other strings...but it's worth it.	16
you will love this movie its so real like and will move you. you will sit and cry all the way to the end. you will see howmuch of pain that christ went though. be careful about small children watching this movie. it has alot of  bad parts in itit show how christ was beat and his body with blood all over him. and when they nail him to the cross. these parts are so bad. not for children to watch. this movie will make you stop and think how much pain he went though for us. it changed my life.	15
So, this is a star wars game, if you like star wars you will most likely buy this.  If you like playing fun games then this is not the game you want to buy.  I have played it about 5 times and hopefully will never play it again.  At its heart it is a dive rolling game, that is pretty much it.  You roll dice, move your ship along a card board strip and roll the dice again. Yeah, save your money and get King of Tokyo instead, if you are looking for fun in a dice rolling game.	22
"I liked this game. In my mind this really isnt a Kids game though. to beat the game 100% actually requires alot of time and effort. Its more the type of game you can play and kids will watch. The controls are pretty easy. its basically MARIO but your a crocodile exploring diffrent levels, theres really nothing groundbreaking.The game does keep your attention and you will have fun completing the levels. A good game if your a patient person, if not youll wonder why its taking you so long to beat this""kids"" game and make you feel stupid."	23
Avery makes some really great products.  It's certainly a name you can trust.  These labels work great for my needs.  I also love the available downloads from the Avery website.  I've had nothing but a pleasant experience with this item and getting the job done.The price seems to be pretty reasonable.  I would also like to add that the price on Amazon is, I think, a little bit cheaper than what I have paid in the past at a couple of different office supply stores (not to mention any names).	17
Inspector Morse isn't a likable character. He's snobby, intellectual and frequently less than kind to Lewis, his &#34;sidekick&#34; so to speak. Nonetheless this is a very watchable series, full of twists and turns, not like the pat formula detective/crime shows we're used to. Sometimes Morse is wrong or off track, only stereotype here is Morse's iffy relationship with his higher ups. As always, in shows about professionals who don't follow standard procedure or obey orders, Morse comes under fire.....	0
I saw this product reviewed on a website for older women who are trying to watch their weight and need a low calorie, high protein snack.  The reviewer, who was over 40, slim and beautiful, said she loved the stuff so I thought I'd give it a try.  I'm very, very glad I did!  I normally don't like beef jerky, don't like the taste and it's always so hard and chewy that it messes with my dental work.  Well, this jerky isn't chewy like most of them are and it was very tasty as well.  Highly recommend!	11
But did you expect any less?Most blazing cuts- &quot;The MC&quot;, produced by newcomer Domingo; &quot;A Friend&quot;, knocked out by Showbiz; &quot;HIPHOP&quot;, featuring Thor-El.  Rare promotional copies may include  &quot;Stop Scheming&quot; featuring R&amp;B crooner, Joe.&quot;Step Into  A World&quot; is featured twice- first in the Jesse West version, and then  the ruff-and-ready remix featuring none other than Puff Daddy!  Hear  today's top hitmaker trade lines with the Blastmaster!!Also, an  experimental thrash cut, &quot;Just To Prove A Point&quot;, does just that.  KRS can pretty much rock over any style that he chooses! (and personally,  I would absolutely LOVE for him to do a whole Rock album!!!!)	9
Product was shipped quickly from Toy 4 Kids. At first, I loved it. It's compact, has all kinds of adapters, and very lightweight -- seemed perfect for travel. My first night in Italy, it plugged right in and charged both my camera battery (in regular outlet) and ipad (using the USB port). Unfortunately, after the 2nd night, there were faint black burn marks on the white plastic and it failed to charge anything else after that. Burnt out after just 2 nights?  In short, great idea but very little durability.	10
I cannot begin to explain how much I have fallen in love with this novel.  I've never been so entertained, intrigued, horrified and ultimately satisfied by a book.  Each character had so much to offer to the story.  I slowed down as I neared the end knowing I had to say good-bye to Jacob, Marlena and Rosie (the smiling elephant!).  I will definitely go to the nearest bookstore and give Gruen's earlier novels a try.  This is by far the best book I have read in a long time.  I am recommending it to everyone I know!!	5
"For years I used a band type filter removal tool.  With the new vehicles going to smaller (thinner) filters, the band wasn't cutting it.  My search for a better filter removal tool brought me here.I like to tighten my oil filters as tight as I can by hand, so I always use a removal tool to loosen it.  This tool has never failed to easily loosen the oil filter in all our vehicles.The pros:+ Low cost, which includes free shipping.+ This tool fits 2-1/2"" to 3-1/8"" filters.The cons:- None that I can think of. :)"	2
Merrell Men's Jungle Moc Slip-On,Gunsmoke,13 W is a not so good fit for my son.  I wish Merrell made more WIDE and extra-wide shoes.  These were a struggle to get on over socks.  After a couple of weeks he admitted to me that he could not wear them but was unable to find the box and receipt for a few days but when he did he brought them over to me.  We printed off a return label and immediately took them to UPS for a return.  The easy Amazon refund only took a few days.	8
I purchased one of these 20 years ago and can't imagine how to get a better one. As a finish sub-contractor I have a need for another and haven't seen a better one. I ordered another! The tool is bullet proof unless you get careless and lift the router and let the bit cut the guides.(it happened?) I'll use the shiney new one and the hired help can use the old one. It can intimidate some on the set-up and use. Don't be scared there are pictures on the carry case! As in most Porter-Cable tools it will last a long time.	21
Do sad they stopped production at 2 seasons.  The producers had finally taken the corny and juvenile schlock our of the Star Gate franchise and given us an Adult Show with complex chatacters and then...  And then...  Some doofus pulled the plug!  So sad!  My wife and I really enjoyed binge streaming Sg-U for the second time.  Very enjoyable characters and story line - though rescuing Chloe gets tedious!!!  The other characters remained engaging.  Sorry it ended so abruptly!	0
Can a stint of a few months in a circus change a boy's life forever? Yawn. The novel is peopled with cut-outs: a diligent country boy orphaned the day before his final exams; an ethereally beautiful horse-tamer with a secret problem (a loutish husband); perverted dwarves; whores with golden hearts; etc. Retold from a retirement home, the novel seems prepped for cinematic treatment, and doesn't linger in literature. It hurtles towards a pre-ordained resolution: the match made in heaven, in the book, and a movie contract for the author. Boo.	5
When I was growing up, I was not exposed to the literary world.  I purchased this kindle book and am so glad I did.It was, at times, repetitive (I wanted to say, 'OK, you told us that already - a few times&#34;.)  At times, it was idealistic and at other times it was realistic.  The detail of how they made the island their own is educational.I definitely got caught up in it.  I would recommend this book to middle school students & pre-teens with imagination.The language requires attention but is worth the effort.	14
Hey Progresso !!Is there a ham crisis ?!?!I noticed that you guys were VERY chinzy on the ham in your split pea soup. The 'chunks' were small and REALLY dried out - and lacking flavor.Whoever was / is the mastermind behind this new so-called recipe should be ashamed. Your OTHER stuff is great, but this 'split pea with ham' is an embarrassment to your good name....Progresso - You've spent DECADES building a solid reputation.Why blow it for a few lousy pieces of HAM - and a few idiots who clearly have no idea how to make YOUR SOUP !!	11
I have always loved to clean my guns after a good day of shooting but I'm always on the look out for new and better methods.  A friend recommended the bore snake and it truly is a godsend.  I simply run solvent completely down the barrel and let it sit while I clean the rest of the weapon.  Then, I simply run the bore snake through the barrel toward the muzzle and pull through, it's really that simple.  Couldn't be happier and would definitely buy again.	20
I'm a big fan of Queen Helene's masks for one particular reason: They're as effective as high end brands, and generally work. This mask in particular is great at evening your skin tone, and shrinking your pores if you use it regularly. I use it at least three times a week, and it makes my skin appear healthy and glowing. I'd also, recommend their other mask,Queen Helene Mint Julep Masque, 8 Ounce. It's an excellent mud mask, and its tingling sensation really makes me feel like it's deep cleaning.	4
I snapped this up for the FAOTD, hoping to finally get a grip on my budget.But if you get bi-weekly payments, you are SOL. There isn't an option for bi-weekly pay. Which is quite a glaring omission. Just doubling up doesn't work, since with bi-week you can get more than two payments every so often.Please fix! I don't mind this since I got this for free, but if I had paid almost ten bucks for a budget app that doesn't contain one of the most common types of pay periods? I'd be ticked.	1
I bought these New Balance mules for around-the-house wear because they slip off easily when I need to go outside to work in the garden, however, they are so comfortable I find myself wearing them for shopping and other social activities as well.They are attractive--look great with jeans and cutoffs--and most important, my heel stays in the shoe. They run true to size. I wear a 9 medium and these in that size fit perfectly. I wish I had them in several colors. I may never go back to lace-up shoes again.	8
THis medication works, because it actually KILLS the bacteria in your bladder because it is converted to Formaldehyde when it reaches the bladder.  It also has salicylate in it (Asprin) to kill the inflammation which causes the symptoms of pain.It really WORKS and used to be a prescription medication.  A relative of mine had a UTI and called her doctor to get an appointment, but surprisingly, the doctors office instructed her to first try Cystex and if no relief in a few hours they would be happy to see her. It really does work.	12
I don't really know if this thing works or not because my 8 mo old refuses to have anything to do with it. Keep in mind that she puts anything & everything in her mouth, will eat any food I try to feed her & is currently teething. It seems like a great idea for that short transition period between mush & solids. This particular one appealed to me because it's not dyed & it's made in the USA. As to whether or not it works? I will never know!	3
I have used these for years and never caught a mouse with one, particularly when using the Tomcat attractant.  What they do well for me is scare our cats.  We remove one of the 2 springs to avoid injury to our little friends, then place them all over the kitchen counters and stove in the evening to teach the younger cats that those are scary places.  It rarely takes more than 2 incidents to drive the lesson home.  Find a better use for a mousetrap and the world will........	18
Whether you're a Pink Floyd fan or a David Gilmore fan, or just a fan of great music, this concert should be on your must have list. It's simply a magnificent display of artistic ability from David Gilmore. From acoustic to electric guitar, from old Pink Floyd songs to new Gilmore tunes, he covers it all masterfully. The supporting band is tight and what a pleasure to actually see a cellist jamming along with David and the band. If you like great music with equally great lyrics, then stop reading this and buy the DVD.	6
SOnic is back and is looking like he never has before. This game is very fun and addictive. It has awesome graphics, and has tons of levels. The only bad thing I can think of about this game is it is a little to easy. You can unlock up to six characters,each with their own adventure. You can play mini-games, and replay previous levels. This is a great game and no one should miss out on it.The short version: Graphics: 4.8 Sound: 4.6 Control: 4.5 Fun Factor: 4.8 Total: 4.7	23
We've had a lot of fun playing this since opening on Christmas day. The cubes are made of a high quality resin (?) that doesn't feel cheesy or cheap. The larger letters allow my child with visual spatial issues to more easily see words as she tries to build. All of the letters that may be ambiguous (m,z,n etc.) are clearly marked as to which side is down. Great strategy game that also builds vocabulary and spelling etc. Great buy that will get lots of use!	22
i first ordered this out of nostalgia, as i seen all the movies as a teen years and years ago.....and i remember being scared out of my wits watching these films.....DEMONS was nothing short of horrifying...AGAIN. oh, sure now that your older and wiser the special effect seen a little cheaper. but i admire the old way of effects...the storyline is plain creepy..being trapped by demons is just scary enough...but make them contagious and BOOM! class action. i love the old way of horror fimls, and i enjoy reliving them. if you would also like to, i'd suggest this movie and its sequel.	15
These headphones work well if you want to listen to music but still be able to hear extraneous sounds (like the phone ringing, baby crying, etc.) without difficulty. The problem with them is that the wire is coated with a canvas-like material that, in my case, without extreme use, opened up in several places exposing the wires. Koss does have a lifetime warranty on the product, however it costs one third of the item's price plus shipping to send it back, and it will most likely have the same problem. Don't waste your money, get something else.	10
"Five stars because it has stood the test of time; I still listen to it, and it was a near perfect follow up to Tesla's first release.The production is way different from the Mechanical CD. Same engineers,just more $$$ to spend I'm sure,but it's more than that.The rythym guitars are much more fuller sounding, the mix just a bit more sonically filled out.This CD is one of the few from that ""era"" that still sits in my CD rack.Buy It!"	9

"Fortunately, the second season of BONES mantains the high standards achieved int he first season.The chemistry between Bones and Booth only improves. Also, the additon of a new female head chief (Cam)for the Jeffersonian team was a clever idea and worked nicely. This, adding to intriguing plots, superb support roles by Ryan O'Neil and Stephen Fry, scaring villains like Eppes and the guy that buried BOnes (the first case to not be solved - probably until further episodes!)and the ""love angle"" with Hodgins and Angela conspired to make this great television."	0
I am a big fan of Fantasie bras, and this one is exceptionally pretty, well-made AND supportive.  It's also very sexy and with the matching panties, just the sort of lingerie I hope to be wearing should I end up in an ambulance or the hospital (I've been told they really DO check out the underwear by two reliable sources.)  If you're larger busted and not typically a fan of the balcony style, take a chance on this bra and I have a feeling you'll be happy with your purchase.	8
I originally purchased this system because I was having trouble getting good symetrical, sharp fingernail grinds on my turning gouges.  The way the system's jigs are set up, its very difficult not to get great results.  All of my turning tools have never been more sharp!  Since then I have purchased other jigs and find they work just as well as the turning tool jig.The only negative thing I can say about it is the price.  Very expensive initially because you'll probably want to get a jig or two along with the machine for your specific needs.	21
Thank goodness for whatever committee decided to standardize on the micro-usb connector for power on so many portable devices.  This power port adapter (power port formerly known as Prince,oops, I mean cigarette lighter) will charge both my phones and both my tablets.  I get a warm fuzzy feeling in knowing it is a Motorola device as I have had positive experiences with Motorola equipment.  To top it off, it has a very cool blue light when it is charging.  So a free light show is included.  Nice charger at a very reasonable price.	7
The AirZooka is a rather large toy that launches a blast of air up to 20' or so. We gave this to my son for Christmas and it turned out to be a surprise hit! The AirZooka was a little hard for my son to assemble on his own, but he was eventually able to get it.Everyone (young and old) had a lot of fun playing with this toy and the cats soon learned to go upstairs when anyone picked it up (Note: No animals were harmed in the writing of this review :-)Recommended!	20
Sturdy with an adjustable mouth and blade tilt.Understand you will need to prep this before use. The sole is not precision ground but machine rough, so you will need a granite block and sandpaper or a set of flat block diamond hones. Once you have your sole (and sides) honed and flat you will need to sharpen the blade. There are several jigs and sharpening tools to assist in this. After all is done apply an anti-rust agent such as wood wax or Boeshield.Once prep'd this is a great plane.	21
We used this chair starting when my daughter was around 8 months old and it was the perfect fit for her.  It was comfortable (or so it seemed) and easy to keep clean!She is 18 months now and we still use it often every day and we have more than gotten our money's worth - but I think she is getting a bit big for it now.  I am eyeing moving up to the regular size Bjorn potty seat, which I hope will be a little more comfortable for her height.	3
Beauty is deceiving. The worst thing about this radio is that the plastic on/off button will be rendered useless after one trip to the beach. Get near a grain of sand and it will cause the button to stick. Keep it inside the house and it is a marginal radio at best, and confusing to use. The plastic body is very cheap as well and seems to disolve when it gets near sun tan lotion. Thousands of these must be sitting in drawers, silenced by the elements! Junk...that's why so many ended up in the bargain bins at retailers.	10
This movie is a well made well acted movie about God's amazing love. This movie is a must see for youth groups! I know from when I was in youth group that there are a lot of cliques in youth group and church, but church is not an exclusive club for those who fit a certain mold. This movie shows that we need to live out Christ's love and gives very practical ways. The movie flashes back to the story of Hosea and Gomer and really explains how much God loves us. I would highly recommend this movie!	15
I purchased this game to be used during a trip with my granddaughters ages 6 and 8.  They loved the game so much that one of them asked that I purchase another one just for them for their birthday.  It is a great tool to assist them in broadening their vocabulary and spelling skills while enjoying the competition of a game. It is easy to play and understand.  Melissa and Doug have designed a visibly appealing and durable product with all parts attached to the one board eliminating the chance of losing pieces.	22
Deer Off makes a great product.  While using Deer Off, my garden has not been terrorized by rabbits.  This is an economical solution and all it requires is a spray pump and some water. A 32 oz bottle will yield you 2 gallons and enough to treat 4000 sq feet according to the manufacture.It dries odorless and is safe to use around pets and children.  My dog is never bothered by it, and still pees on the bushes.  But at least the flowers haven't been eaten by rabbits.It's a great product, I recommend it.	18
I've had several bankers boxes for miscellaneous storage needs over the years, but nothing like these.  These heavy-duty boxes are very sturdy and stack easily.  I actually like to use these for underbed storage and they fit perfectly under mine.  Considering that my old bankers boxes lasted for almost 20 years, I'm certain the heavy-duty ones will last even longer.  They're also super simple to put together.  And if you don't need all the boxes, you can keep the unused ones flat for easy storage.  Highly recommended.	17
"This is a larger version of the MSI-Pro 201B. I couldn't tell what the difference was before buying, so I bought both. The 225-D is made from 3/32"" steel, whereas the 201-B is made from 1/16"" steel. Both seem reasonably well made, but if I had known the difference I would have bought two of the 225-D instead of one of each, because the 225-D is cheaper and more heavy-duty. If you need a smaller clamp, however, the 201-B might be the better choice."	21
However for me it just doesn't hold enough to be really a piece I'd be able to carry long term. Now we all need so many club cards for stores you to those plus a credit card and drivers license you can barely squish your Health and Car insurance cards it it. Unless you don't have much to carry, I'd say skip it. Buxton, consider making this a little bigger to carry more and its a serious winner. Now if the banks would still make this style of checkbook It would be very convenient.	8
I LOVE THIS APP !!! IT IS EASY FOR ME TO FINALLY KEEP TRACK OF MY EATING HABITS WITHOUT ALL THE WORK ...I. WOULD ALWAYS FORGET TO WRITE THINGS DOWN UNTIL NOW PLUS IT HELPS FIND ANYTHING. I NEED TO LOOK UP THE CALORIE COUNT ON...WITHOUT THIS APP I WOULD GIVE UP AGAIN BUT NOW I LOOK FORWARD TO KEEPING TRACK.THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR MAKING MY NEW LIFESTYLE EASIER. BUT IF YOU ARE GOING TO UPDATE ANYTHING PLEASE GIVE MORE SIZE CHOICES ONCE THE FOOD IS ENTERED...LIKE 1/4 CUP 1/2 CUP ETC WOULD BE NICE	1
This black Century Karate Gi (uniform) is high quality and is exactly the same as the ones provided at our Dojo. My son needed a second Gi since he likes to wear a clean one every time. I have been using Century uniforms for years and have always been pleased with how well they hold up.These come with very long legs and arms so it needed to be hemmed to fit. It is also a little stiff right out of the package but with wear and a few washings it becomes very comfortable.Highly Recommended!CFH	20
This is one of my all-time favorites!  For some reason, I put off reading this book for months.  I tried to convince myself that it didn't look interesting.  Was I ever wrong!  This will stay in my house, I will not trade or sell it, or loan it out.  It's that good!  Reading the author's notes, I discovered it was based on the the Biblical story of Jacob.  Then I had to read it all over again!  And I still loved it!	5
Amazon cloud where all your music is stored with unlimited space was supposed to be free with my Kindle Fire. plus I'm already paying $70 a year for Amazon Prime! The Google Music Manager still has unlimited space for free (or when you purchase music from them). that's where I will be headed when Amazon says my time is up, rather than getting nickled and dimed to death and having to choose and upload those 25 songs. Bah bye, Amazon. my next tablet won't be a Kindle.	1
Dino Crisis is a great game -- lots of excitement, suspense, and action.  It doesn't fail there.  I beat it in four days (seven hours playing time), though, so definitely rent it first.Some of the voice acting is weak,  but it's not the worst out there.  The story will keep you interested, as  will the battles with the enemy dinosaurs.  An added plus is the decisions  you must make at key points in the story, but even this (and the different  costumes) isn't enough to give the game the replay value it needs to make  it a 5-star game.	23
Hands down BEST BATH EVER. This bathtub is awesome. We originally purchased a different tub, but at 4 months our baby outgrew that one so we opted to buy the PRI EuroBath. I only wish we'd bought this tub first. It is big, but its not any more cumbersome than a smaller tub. Our little man has plenty of room to splash around and he can rest comfortably in it with all of his bath toys. It is super easy to clean and a great great product. Don't bother buying the smaller tubs, go with this one!!	3
I'm 5'0&#34; and 130-140lbs, but I have larger thighs than typical for my height and weight. It makes purchasing and wearing thigh highs difficult and often unappealing. However, these are great. They are a bit too long, since this specific E/F size is meant for much taller customers, but its not as though the nylons are wrinkling and bunching all over, so you can't notice it. They fit great and the material on the band makes them stay up (and if you're untoned, will bunch your thighs a bit in the clinginess to stay up)	8
I've tried many different moisturizers.  I've been looking for something that helps with the fine lines, but doesn't make my face greasy or clog my pores.  I love this moisturizer!  It feels like velvet, absorbs quickly, and doesn't cause my face to break out.  The description says it's unscented, but it does have a very, very light fragrance.  It's not perfumey, just fresh and clean.  I'm on my second bottle and I can absolutely see a difference in the texture of my skin.	4
I remember learning, back in 1st or 2nd grade, how to make standard scotch tape in to double sided tape by just making a loop. That lesson is probably the most-used lesson from that time in my life and I still use that trick on a somewhat regular basis. Scotch Mounting Tape steps things up a couple of notches. Since receiving this tape I have used it to secure a large calendar to my desk, hand a couple of light pictures, and to hold display bottles in place at a chocolate fair.It's light, inexpensive, durable and is handy to have around.	17
I have clay soil. It immediately clogged the tines. You can keep making holes with the tines clogged, but since the soil is not being ejected, all you are doing is further compacting the soil below. You may think you are helping your lawn, but you are actually making it worse. I suspect this is a good tool if you have soil that is dry, or sandy, and therefore likely to eject from the top. With my type of soil, which is fairly common, it was basically useless. Please check your soil before spending your hard-earned money on this.	18
"What an encouraging story!  With all the odds against him, Dr. Carson came out on top with his faith and the teaching and prayers of his Mom.  If you are a single parent, I highly recommend this movie as a great source of inspiration.  The positive impact of a parent is so dramatically displayed.And if you are into details, be sure to watch the ""extra"" information on the making of the movie.  It will really add to your appreciation of Dr. Carson and those who worked so hard to bring his story to life."	15
What can I say, it's awesome sugar. Sugar is good, sugar is best for everything. Just don't have too much because too much sugar can lead to health issues. Overall, I'm happy with this purchase except for the packaging. The sugar was opened and it came out all over inside the box. I lost about 30% of the sugar. However, I contacted customer support, and they issued me a full refund. I'm not removing any stars because this wasn't shipped directly from Amazon, so I can't put all the blame on them. All my other orders have been flawless.	11
This is my second casio watch and I like my purchase.  The face of the watch is bit larger than a quarter.  It is pretty much unisex, I had no qualms using it.  My wrist are thin, and this watch looks great.  The best part about the watch is that it is pretty much waterproof so I don't fear it breaking when I forget to take it off when I for instance wash the dishes.  It is durable, the face can scratch easily but so far I have taken good care of it.	8
So many of my favorite characters die off or disappear on this series.  Only two of the original cast remain by the end of the series.  It's an intriguing series, novel, but basically same plot for each episode which eventually culminates in one master plot line of saving the world by collapsing universes.  The &#34;monsters&#34; all seem cast of the same mold and this is where innovation and imagination could have catapulted the series.  If you want something of the same ilk with more innovation and sophistication, try FRINGE--the whole series.  You won't be disappointed.	0
the price and size were right to donate to humane society. My cats have refused to switch to purina or whiskas from Blue buffalo. I was seeking to reduce costs but just knew when I saw the big bag that there was no way my cats would eat it.  I had thought it was fancy feast...white cat...gourmet...so when I realized its just a cheaper brand than even the purina ....well. As a donation though it helps Im sure.. The dogs will eat it if the cats wont..at my place the racoons get whatever the cats reject.	19
I hate it when my moisturizer slithers of my face like an oil slick, or is so thick you almost have to add water to spread it onto your face. Just one pump of this covers my face, neck and d&eacute;collet&eacute;. Makeup application is smooth, and seems to stay put longer than usual when I use this. I haven't noticed any major changes in the appearance of my fine lines, etcBut I do like he way my skin feels when I use this.  I'd order it again for sure.	4
I originally had the Cars debut on 8track twenty something years ago--The tape pulled out (remember how 8 tracks did that?) so I bought the record album--after playing it soooo many times I was able to see through it--I  went and bought the cassette--needless to say--I wore it out too. I now  have the CD and am trying my hardest to wear it out. The format may wear  out but great tunes never die--I must have listened to the Cars debut album  over a thousand times--it's still great. A classic among classics.	9
I've always loved hazelnut creamer in my coffee, and when I was diagnosed with diabetes, I really tried to drink my morning Joe, without cream or sugar.  HAD to add an artificial sweetner, but still tried to do without a creamer - but I couldn't do it.  SO happy I found this sugar-free product on Amazon.com, and that I'm able to buy a quantity of 6 at a good price.  Per container cost in the grocery stores is about $1.00 more!  Thanks Coffee Mate and thanks Amazon!	11
Addario strings are ok.. Although like beauty it is in the eyes of the beholder... Aquila seems to be the most popular now. I have used both and I am satisfied with both...I play the soprano, concert, tenor, and baritone. Each one different in it on right...Also play the the concert scale banjolele.. Only been playing the uke for 5 years and the banjo for 10 so it is only IMHO.  Be aware though that 10 years experience can mean 1 year experience 10 times:))))	16
This charger is one of the fastest I have for my phone. Being a Micro B USB it will work with almost any smart phone. The spiral wound cord works well for the short distance in my car, but still is long enough for the chasm of my old Ford Truck as well. The only drawback that I've come across is that bright blue LED that can light up the whole car at night. It's very distracting while driving and I strongly suggest rotating the charger so the light is away from the driver's eyes.	7
This pedal was the mainstay of my effects for a few years.  It really does have a ton of range, although it only does one effect at a time, so you'd have to reach down and change the knobs mid-show in order to get the other variations.  My most commonly used setting was with the overdrive-distortion mix knob at about 2 o'clock, which produces a very professional sounding Grunge-type effect.  If you want any of those 90's sounds, excluding the heavier metal sounds, this pedal will definitely get you there.	16
I think this is the best soap I've ever used. Ever. I have never felt cleaner. I watched a documentary about this product and the family history and had to try it. I am glad I did. Honestly, the label creeps me out a little bit, but at the same time I find it kinda fascinating. This stuff can be used as shampoo, body wash, laudry detergent...and plenty of other things. The fact that it is totally organic is just another awesome bonus. Try it.	20
This package was released sometime after the 1997 release of Michael Jackson's BLOOD ON THE DANCE FLOOR album. There is a video for BOTDF in this package. I just love SCREAM. That video features MJ's sister Janet,who's freaky like her brother. Take note of two censorships when the video is seen on MTV or VH1. The second word of the quoted line in SCREAM that goes &quot;stop f---ing with me&quot; is muted and also during that,Janet &quot;flips the digit&quot; which is blurred. Sorry,they're just following FCC regulations. No MJ fan should be without this package unless he/she chooses not to.	6
As promised, the acting, cinematography, and general production values are top notch.  But like the Sopranos, I find the content toxic and depressing.  There is already a pattern of a buildup of tension and a narrow escape.  This chemistry teacher is going to have to come up with more complicated strategies to pull off this double life.  But he seems to have a sociopathic disregard for the lives he's destroying even as his own body is wasting away.  I'm simply not up for 40 more hours of covert drug manufacturers.	0
I really hated this game it oz a waste of memory and Iwill never get a game created by this company again. Irecommend NOT toget this app. I was entirely dissatisfied with app. All you do is jump the same old obsticle. What ever you do DO NOT GET THIS APP.BORRING!!!!!A WASTE OF SPACE!!!! WHO EVER MADE THIS GAME WAS A DUMMY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!	1
I always buy a few hoses, two 10 footers and a 15 ft hose. I then connect together the best combination lenth hose that will get from water source to RV. Keeps my camp area neat, plus why on hot days would I want the sun heat the water in the hose and have to wait for the water to get cool by running it. Just makes more sense adding what ya need together then 30 ft of hose sprawel out on your camp site. Most campsites you will end up using the 15 footer anyway.	2
The Koss PortaPro are great set of headphones for the ipod classic.  I read other people reviews and majority of them being very positive so I gave them a try.  Wow, the sound that comes from these headphones are great(no static/noise).  The fit of these is very comfortable and adjustable to any size.  I thought the metal would bother me( I shave my head) but no problem here I do not feel them.  If you are looking for a great set of headphone that will not break the bank and sound great look not further.	10
THIS IS MY HUSBANDS FAVORITE CEREAL. I TRIED EDUCATING HIM ON THE EXTREMELY IMPORTANT INFO ON GENETICALLY MODIFIED CORN (PLEASE READ THE 2ND REVIEW!) BUT HE'S A 53YR OLD GROWN MAN MAKING HIS OWN DECISION. I HAD 2 GIVE IT 5 STARS BECAUSE IT ARRIVED QUICKLY, THE PKGING IN PRISTINE CONDITION, THE CONTENTS R FRESH, IT HAS A FAR OFF DUE DATE  + COST ME NEARLY HALF WHAT I PAY IN THE SUPERMARKET. BV IF U HAVE MORE SENSE THAN MY HUSBAND, PLEASE DONT EAT THIS STUFF!	11
I only use this aftershave in the summer because it tends to dry my skin in the brutal Chicago winter. It works great after a nice straight razor shave; smells great and cools my skin. It's alcohol-based, but I'm surprised it doesn't sting as much as I expected. Since the dispensing hole is a bit too big, I cover half of it with my thumb before squirting it into my hand. One day, a female acquaintance hugged me and commented I smelled really good. Two weeks later she asked me out ;)	12
I can't believe this is 20 years old! When Asia first came out with this package it really shook up the music world. Every song on this CD can be listened to over and over. It's rare when 4 &quot;superstars&quot; can get  together and produce a sound this good. It's rarer still when they can keep  doing it. Asia didn't. After this album they tried to  &quot;cookie-cut&quot; their songs and they became trite and boring. But  for one sweet summer this was the music that the world was loving. Do  yourself a favor. BUY THIS CD!	9
My husband and I are hooked on Bananagrams!While I've always been a fan of word games, Scrabble in particular, my husband is never as excited to get out the board and play a game.  Bananagrams is the perfect alternative to Scrabble as it effectively eliminates the boring sit-and-wait-your-turn piece that often seems interminable.  Since we can both play simultaneously, we both stay engaged and on our toes the whole game.  One negative for us is that with just 2 players, a single round can take quite awhile.	22
My first pair lasted 16 years. Somewhere along the line, Sony decided to make the plastic film covering the ear pads thinner, that they would wear out after a year or so and need replacing. Most of their headphones are designed this way. After a few months, the ear pads come apart at the seams. Within a year, bits of black plastic will begin to tear off and stick to your face. Within two years, the ear pads will be completely shredded.These are low-quality, overpriced headphones. You will do better with other brands.	10
In the past I've always limited my search for hose couplings to local hardware stores.  That was a mistake.  After searching Amazon and finding this highly rated product, I decided to give it a try.  Boy is this a heck of a lot better than what I've been getting.Installation is a cinch and once you have it screwed on, it isn't coming off.The threaded part of this coupling is nicely machined and screws together nicely with other attachments.  After I tried one of these, I immediately bought more and used them to replace the couplings on my other hoses.	18
What Can I say? Palm products have always been of the best quality, and the Palm V Hotsync Cradle is no exception. I purchased an extra cradle for use with another desktop, so I can sync with several computers. The cradle bottom is metal, and there is enough weight that it does not move if the cord has a bit of pull on it. A must buy for palm V(x) users that need to sync with another computer, or need one at the office and at home. Whatever the case maybe, its very handy to have an extra cradle around.	10
I bought this product to keep my motorcycle charged between rides.  I ride the bike pretty often so I probably don't need it but it does come in handy for those occasions when I go a week or more without riding, like when I am doing upgrades or repairs to the bike.  I just plug it in the night before a ride and in the morning the battery is fully charged and ready to roll.  Great product for a reasonable price.  I really like the jumper cables and keep them in  my saddle bag in case of emergencies!	2
This item is an impoved version of a sweeper called Clean Boy. I paid over 200 bucks for one. This is basicly the same thing, but well impoved for way less than half the price.  I use it for cleaning the driveway, around the pool and the curb.  It works very well, just dont excpect it to do anything unreasonable. Stores easy also, you can hang it up by the handle and the main unit will go flat againts the wall.  sorry my reviews arent the best.. but I can tell you this item was worth it...	18
I received a Braun shaver for Xmas last year and looked around for refills to keep the shaver clean.  We even thought of refilling ourselves but after the first try, this was not the ideal solution to using the refills.  We found these at Walmart for a good price but then when those refills were almost gone, I searched for a better price.  The Amazon automatic supply system for refilling these ended up being the best price anywhere and, with free shipping and scheduled shipments, this is one less thing we have to concern ourselves with.  Great product -- excellent value.	12
I really wanted it to work on my 10/22 breakdown, but gave up after getting it sighted in at 6x, then going to 3x or 9x.  It would not hold zero.  3x went to lower left quadrant, 9x to upper right quadrant.  Several tests convinced me I had a defective scope.  Tired of messing with lower priced variable zoom scopes, purchased a Nikon rimfire 4x- no issues.  Decided I did not need 9x on a .22 rifle.  FWIW: I do not have this problem on my large caliber Nikon variable zoom scopes.	20
This is the Chinese Fiskars product line. All their shovels are made there, and I have repeated problems with their D Handle shovels. The blade is not aligned properly with the handle. The handle is cocked at an angle so that it twists the wrist when using it. I have returned several shovels to Amazon, and now I give up. And, yes, it is not pre-sharpened. And, no, it came with no PVC sleeve. If Fiskars wants to cheapen their image with this poor quality, I will be thinking three times before I buy Fiskars in the future.	18
"Well, I just recently bought this game again, after finding it broken from unkown causes quite a few years ago. People keep on saying, ""Tekken 2 has HORRIBLE graphics and the gameplay is horrible!"", To those people, did you ever think that this game came out during the 90's and was probably awesome graphics back then? If you're a fan of good fighting games, I reccomend this. It has lots of characters, fair graphics, and is a good collectible for your Tekken collection."	23
Our two Schnauzers love this toy. As with most toys, if they last six months, I'm happy.  It's been about six months and Mr. Bill is going strong.  Our Schnauzers are pretty smart.  They know their toys names and will retrieved them when called.  This one is called &#34;Oh No!&#34;, what Mr Bill calls out.  As soon as we say OH NO! they are searching for Mr Bill.When we travel, Mr Bill is one of the toys that they look for in their travel bag.  It has been a lot of fun for the dogs and for us too.	19
"I used the free version, and liked it so much that I moved to the Pro version. Very easy to visualize, add people, and post tweets. I really like the Black background, white fonts. The font size can be increased which is awesome for me. Lot of customizations. No complaints and after using bunch of twitter clients, I settled on this app. Never crashed on me. If anybody likes screenshots, leave me a comment. I will upload within a day.I have used on 4"", 5.5"", 7"", 9.7"" android versions and had no issues whatsoever!"	1
Never owned a speedloader before but I decided to purchase a few for my GP100 .357 Magnum revolver. At the tiime, I didn't know of any other make but the HKS seemed to be a quality product. I haven't changed my mind about that after using this product for some time now. Simplicity itself and they work beautifully. i now know there are &#34;other&#34; speedloaders out there but you would be hard pressed to beat the HKS for reliability and, almost impossible to beat the product for the price.	20
This soap made me realize how much I like soap lather.  I never felt clean using this because it doesn't lather.  I would use some with a loofa, and I'd have to add more 2-3 a shower session.  I was going through way more of this than I would regular body wash!  I'm sure it was cleaning just fine, but I have oily skin and need the &#34;reassurance&#34; soap lather provides.Basically, if you have OCD like me you may want to avoid this soap.	20
Summer is coming and ice tea is my favorite summertime beverage.  Lipton has always been my favorite tea and Amazon had a special and I bought these.  What came quickly are two large containers of tea.  I prefer tea over soda in the summer.  Plus, when I am barbequing and getting everything ready, having the instant tea right on the counter, I can make my beverage quickly and still serve dinner at the same time.  Thanks for the quick shipment and good price on a good tasting beverage.	11
If you like Old Man and the Sea, you'll love this.  It is similar in feeling and has a Spanish flair.  I seldom remember lines from books, but I've memorized many from this novel.  The opening quote from John Donne is  as deep as they come.  It sets the tone for the book, but is better  understood if you immediately re-read the quote right after finishing the  book.  You really truly understand then what is meant when he says,  &quot;Do not send to know for whom the bell tolls....it tolls for  thee.&quot;	5
Come on, paper is paper and ruled refills are rule refills.True, but there is a bit more to it.It all depends on how you like to write. I personally like to write with a fountain pen. (I know, anachronistic) thus, I need paper that will not let the fountain pen ink, that is liquid instead of a gel like ball points or gel pens, seep through the paper.I'm glad to say that this is a solid paper, that holds the ink and has proper texture.I recommend it without reservations.	17
This is the perfect soy for making stir fry; pepper steak and for marinades.  Dark soy is heavier than the stuff you get at the grocery store.  If you have never used dark soy to cook, I would highly recommend it - has a fuller bodied flavor and makes a huge difference when making the brown sauce (like in pepper steak or beef with asparagus, etc.)  If you are like me, once you have used dark soy for cooking, you will never again use the thin watery soy sauce.	11
This canned chicken is the perfect thing to make a quick salad, sandwhich, or toss into a soup for lunch or dinner.While it will never replace a roast chicken in the oven ready to be served, it's got a nice chicken taste. It's just not as firm as regular chicken you prepared yourself.If you remember to keep a can or two in your desk at work, you won't be without some solid nutrition in a pinch. Try it cold with some yummy salad dressing and a few crackers!Swanson Premium Chunk Chicken Breast is an excellent buy.	11
growing up in chicago in the 60's and 70's, i was fortunate to see and experience many great bands of the era for cheap/the first time i saw traffic, i had front row seats and it was magical/this dvd in santa monica is a realistic representation of this talented group of musicians of the early seventies/the close-ups of chris wood playing the flute and sax are very special to me/what is nice about a concert dvd, is that you can turn off the tv and listen like a cd/a nice addition to my i-pod classic/get it while you can//peace	6
"This is a good watchband.  It fits many Timex watches including the Expedition.  The band itself is a canvas strap which I like alot because it ""breathes"" with me.  The clasp is the end of the band which goes through a plastic loop and fastens to itself with velcro.  Actually my only complaint is that I'm a big guy and the strap, even at its most loose, is a bit tight for me.  I know - lose weight!  So, my overall rating is good, but for me, not great."	8
Baby is breast-fed and I registered for these so I could pump and my husband could feed her at night.  Our baby hated the bottle and wouldn't take the nipple.  The nipples, on the Avent, are too long and hard and would make her gag when she attempted to latch on.  We switched to the Platex NaturalLatch and now she takes a bottle.  The nipples on the Platex are much softer and shorter.  Baby switches between the bottle and breast now, no problem.	3
This album has stood the test of time. As I write this review 20 years after its release, the album still is sweet music to my ears. I bought the cassette in the winter of 1990 and fell asleep listening to it every night for the next 6 months. No matter how much I listened I never got tired of it.Track listing:1. Don't Cha Think 9/102. Heat of the Moment 8.5/103. Can't Stop 9.5/104. My Only Woman 6.5/105. One Night 10/106. Love's Been So Nice 7.5/107. Ready or Not 11/10!!!8. Sayonara 7/10	9
I used this for a while. Though hollow plastic I felt it was designed to hold a camper from rolling and it did. One day I forgot to remove it when pulling out and it seems to take very little pressure moving forward to flatten it like a pan cake so I though my 50,000 investment may be better served with a heavy duty galvanized wheel chock that wont give in and even let me move over it by mistake and let me know its holding solid if I ever did again roll forward over it.	20
The low rating is because the product description was not thorough enough for this old man.I blame Brother & myself (hindsight, I should have investigated the product more) The descriptionsaid &#34;Brother M231 1/2-Inch Black on White Tape for P-Touch Labeler &#34;  I have a &#34;P-Touch&#34; labeler &mistakenly thought the cartridges were for my P-Touch, not knowing there must be other models of P-Touch.I am a retired manufacturer & my old school thinking was to change model designation  when models were notcompatible.	10
"Personally, I love the nanoweb strings.  I have 4 guitars, and they each get played once every couple weeks.  As I'm no pro, I don't want to put strings on them that I'm going to have to change every time, just to mess around at my apt.I don't mind that they are extra slippery, or that they sound a tad bit ""different"" than other strings.  They're exactly what I want - A string that makes my guitar sound good for 4 months without changing strings."	16
It's been several months since I've purchased the Presto 6-Quart Stainless Steel Pressure Cooker, and I have to admit that this cooker packs some seriously power!  Having a pressure cooker speeds up cooking so much - I've been able to make a lot of Chinese Soups in a fraction of the time it takes to make normally!  This pot is especially good when cooking soups with proteins, particularly beans and meat.  Because it cooks so quickly, we're not only enjoying dinner faster, but saving a lot of energy to boot!  Highly recommended!	13
This bra does what it claims it will do--it provides firm support even for plus sized women, and the support doesn't go away after washing.  I just wish it weren't so shiny.  It's not terribly attractive, just functional, but the straps will show with most clothing, so you may want a lacy camisole over this.  Unless they can change the shininess without reducing the support, I'll live with it 'as is'.  A great bra in terms of function!	8
So much that I went back and bought a second pair in case they got discontinued.  I hate putting shoes on, so the slide style is great for me.  The fit is perfect, the support is fabulous, and they must look really cool, because I have had perfect strangers in the park approach me to ask me where I got them.I'm a little ambivalent about the pink bow issue ever since it was brought to my attention.  But I can live with it in exchange for how pain-free my orthopedic feet are when I wear them.	8
This can come in handy for different home projects and decorating. For example, I decorated a huge bathroom mirror with small framed pictures using this double sided tape, it looked great. Perfect when you can't or don't want to ruin a wall with a nail.  I also decorated the ceramic tile backsplash in the kitchen with the same sort of small framed pictures.  The tape is not too hard to remove from the glass/mirror/tile surfaces but expect some difficulty when removing from painted walls.  A little sanding of the residue is needed.	17
Mega Man Legends is a great new series for mega man.  The story takes him to an island searching for energy crystals on his dig adventures.  Game play is fun and easy to learn.  The game has plenty of secret goodies for you too discovery adding hours of replay value.  easy and fun to play but not easy enough that you'll only spend oh...one week or so one it.  Loads of fun a most have for hardcore mega man and new mega man fans of all ages!!!	23
This feeder is very easy to clean and to fill.  Lots of feeding stations.  There are perches all around, and the hummingbirds appreciate this.  Since there is no container above the feeding stations, you can see the birds from all angles, a big plus.  This would be a 5 star product if the design was modified a bit.  If the feeder was a bit smaller in circumference and a little deeper, it could still hold 16 ounces of nectar with slower evaporation and a little more stability when hanging.  This is a good, functional feeder that's reasonably priced.	18
This product works as advertised. Avery has been in the label business a long time, and knows how to specialize. They make affordable labels. The most difficult part for me in using labels made for a printer is setting up the program that has the addresses on them. Word makes this a little easier. Once this is accomplished, the labels can be put in the printer, printer settings changed to accept them, and you have printed address labels. Much quicker than doing this by hand, and they look so much better!	17
I like the Speedo Hydrospex Swim Goggles. They have a snug, relatively comfortable (for googles) fit and won't leak if you follow the instructions on the package. These Speedos look good in the water and provide decent visibility. I find the tinted versions too dark to see underwater.  I have used these clear goggles for a year now, and after about 30 uses,  there are no durability issues so far. These are nice goggles at an affordable price, better than the cheap ones I had as a kid that leaked all the time!	20
I found that these were really useful when used in a quiet environment with loud sounds that come periodically, like a gun range. When worn with ear plugs, they amplify speech so you can hear conversations in between shots or bangs.However, when used in an area with high ambient noise (engine room, construction site), they function about the same as regular earmuffs because the amplified audio cannot be heard over the ambient noise.Pros: Works well for the rangeCons: Doesn't work well for areas with high levels of ambient noiseOverall: 3/5 starsI recommend using rechargeable batteries.	20
I bought this video at the same time as I bought &quot;Do the Alphabet&quot; and now my two-year old nephew won't watch it.  He only asks for &quot;Bic Birt&quot; (Big Bird is on the box of &quot;Alphabet&quot;).  I've tried sneaking it into the VCR when he isn't watching in hopes he'll  get hooked, but he always asks plaintively for the other one.  Personally,  I think that they count a little fast for him while the  &quot;Alphabet&quot; tape goes pretty slow.  And Baby Bear is always a  winner.  I think though that he will appreciate when he gets a little  older.	15
It is simply mind boggling how useful and efficient this item turned out to be.  It holds all but the longest handtools (2 foot plus levels, etc)with easy access.  Of course, nothing is perfect, so here are my suggestions for future improvements: deeper bellows on a couple of the lower tier pockets and a shallow series of slots for mini screwdrivers (smaller screws seem to be the latest trend). This could be done by replacing the elastic strap at the upper edge with a looped belt of the same basic material as the Bucket Boss	21
I've used cheaper masking tape before (never used anything more expensive...)  But, this masking tape works great.  Even for the lazy painter, slapping this masking tape on a somewhat greasy kitchen surface - and it still sticks to it!The width is pretty nice, but if using a sprayer, you'd probably want to go double-wide with it.  And it peeled off paint, new and old, flat and gloss - without taking any paint with it.  A great product...even if it is a bit pricey.	17
This product is great on tires!!!! It's not runny and sticks well to the tires. For some reason it smells great to? Anyhow, wear some latex gloves and use a sponge like applicator to apply the gel. After a couple uses your tires will have soaked it in to the point that you will only need to use a dirty rag to wipe the dust and grime off the tires and they will actually still have a shine!! I recommend this product....&#34;PS works great on exterior trim as well.&#34;Dec. 16, 2013	2
"I wear a 38C Bra size, and this bra fits the bill!!! Love it!  I just ordered another one.  I would highly recommend this bra.  It is very sexy, and comfortable.Update:After wearing this bra for a day, it's NOT comfortable.  I would not recommend it all, and I have returned the other one that was ordered, and the one I kept goes in the ""Not form fitting, and comfortable"" draw.  I got the Marielle Unlined bra instead, so far it is very comfortable, and fits nicely to the breasts.  I will be ordering another pair!"	8
"again and again i find stuff on amazon for far cheaper then in store. We have best buy where i live and have to go there for parts. They are so overpriced that i have stopped going there and am more then happy to wait for belivery. I am a pc gamer and play on a 55"" in my living room. I had been using wireless keyboards but they always were haveing range or interference problems so i bought this cord. More then enuff length for me to use my keyboard anywhere in my living room."	10
The shipping was quick. The colors are pretty but the sheets themselves are not soft. That was disappointing to my daughter who I bought the sheets for and of course to me. They are not inexpensive so I expected more. I purchased five sheets to go with the co-sleeper I bought her for their first baby. We have not assembled the co-sleeper yet but when I received it the box was all torn and dented. Looking at it the contents looks okay, but we will see when the my son in law puts it together.	3
Where do u begin? well its an overall good app! but u can tune into ur local radio or any station.in fact im listening to it right now as i type. you can find fav artists and songs.no glitches or viruses happend. very good for those people who really like to listen to the radio at night i know i do! Add songs and artists to ur favorite tad and either buy the song or see if its anywhere on the radio.PLZ do me a huge favor and get!!!!!	1
I love this strainer and have to say that it does a much better job of rinsing out water than my cuter tiny colander, which tended to collect water (sort of beside the point, right?).  This is a sturdy feeling little guy and I expect it to last for quite some time.  I find myself using it several times a day to drain berries, and it's also handy for straining home-made ice-cream (the initial custard step), sifting flour, dusting desserts with powdered sugar, rinsing rice, and for any small draining or straining needs.  Highly recommended!	13
I bought this tool primarily because it seems like a nice gadget to have to make sure my carcases and cabinets are square. But after getting it, I find myself using it for a new purpose all the time. As with all Bosch tools, the construction of this digital protractor is excellent. Checking the accuracy of the protractor with a few expensive engineering squares showed that the protractor is dead on. I think I can finally build that corner cupboard I have always wanted to. Perfect birthday or Christmas present for the woodworker in your life.	21
&quot;Jazz Samba&quot; is such a great album that only one other bossa nova album exceeds its quality- &quot;Getz/Gilberto&quot;.  Getz and Byrd, jazz musicians, not only introduce Brazilian bossa nova to a larger audience, but do so in a way that is timeless.Many of the compositions here have become classics of our culture, &quot;Desifinda&quot;, &quot;Samba de Uma Nota S&oacute;&quot; and &quot;O Pato&quot;.  Don't worry if you don't recognize the titles, once you hear them you recognize the music.If you have &quot;Getz/Gilberto&quot; than &quot;Jazz Samba&quot; won't disappoint.  This is great music that belongs in everyone's collection.	9
"These ties are just what I expected from the photo and description. They are  8"" velcro ties with a little tag on the end so you can grasp them easily. The colors are identical to the product photo, and the quality is high.I use these for managing all the wires and cords in my workspace and they do a great job. The only improvement I might suggest is make the tag white so I can write notes on it with a sharpie, like PR for Printer or ST for Stereo. Other than that they are perfect."	10
If you are restoring a 35 years old BMW classic you need only the best and this (as all Mothers products I have used so far- and they are many) is among if not the best.Several applications (every week)during the first 3 months have restored all rubber to its new like condition and this brings not only a better look but also brings back the purpose of seals all over the car. From noise reduction to air tightness to better working AC and well,many other advantages.Believe me, I don't own the company!	2
I read this book in a day. I simply could not put it down. It was so dark, with just a touch of goodness, which in itself was even complex. The love aspect of the story was so muddied, and heart wrenching, it made me feel for Jacob and for Marlena. How confusing it all was.Plus this story is based around a lifestyle we never hear about...a traveling circus. I loved Jacob, Marlena, and animals and even began to love Kinko.This book is by far a favorite, and so captivating.	5
When I have the time, I usually like to use a dry clay mask that I mix with water or vinegar. If I'm pressed for time, I reach for Queen Helene Masque Mud Pack, and it really is good as a fast fix to get out the impurities caused by cosmetics, excess facial oils and the general crud that floats around in the air. If you don't currently use a clay mask, this is a great one to start with. You will instantly see a difference when you apply fresh make-up. Very good!	4
I'm fortunate to have a local store that sells great pickled ginger made fresh, but getting minced ginger is a chore. I went through several different brands and types before I found this one. A bit sweet, a bit spicy and easy to mix into most anything, I like this ginger because it's a simple addition to Asian dishes. No mincing to do on your own, the ginger itself is moist with a nice consistency and everything about it seemed fresh. I'm about to buy another jar of it.	11
I can't believe it took me this long to pick this book up.  What a great story and very well written.  I always enjoy books that go back and forth between past & present, and the author did it brilliantly.The only thing I disliked was reading about the treatment of the animals, but that is to be expected with a circus story.Would definitely recommend this book to a friend.  I'm sure the upcoming move won't do the book justice, but will at the very least draw some new readers.	5
Sturdy metal potato smasher, which gets used by us for everything but mashing potatoes.  We use this metal potato masher for breaking down ground beef, ground turkey and sausage for things like spaghetti sauces and lasagna or any other dish that requires crumbled meat.  It is a trick I learned from some show on Food Network, and once I learned this trick, it really made that step in cooking so much easier.  Also, we have tried it with plastic potato mashers and it does not work as well.  Metal potato smashes for crumbled cooked meat.  It just makes sense.	13
Took a little convincing to spend the money on these, but I bit the bullet and I'm glad I did.  They cut quick, clean, and just great.  I'm using them to build my Cobra Replica and I have yet to build one, even after drilling through all sorts of materials and hundreds of holes.  Very happy with this purchase and I'd recommend them to anyone.  The only thing that would be nice is if they had a drill bit size guide on the back, like my cheaper set did.  Just a minor thing, but would be a nice addition.	21
This is a great product for the short term. It will repel most mammals that are likely to take up residence under a structure or deck. I had a skunk under my backyard shed, and I spread this around the openings that it used, and the animal left. However, it's not practical to keep spreading this product indefinitely (though I do like its black-pepper odor). I ended up purchasing theSunforce Solar Pest Repeller two-pack(it is best to have at least two of these), which is now my long-term deterrent of choice. However, for a quick solution, Havahart Critter Ridder is hard to beat.	18
I don't know where I'd be without both my Kindle and my new Kindle Fire!  I bought my first Kindle when I had my shoulder op. Wow,  how have I ever managed without it? But be WARNED,  if you start a library,  make sure you keep your old email address and password if you decide to change your email address to a new one.  Libraries are not transferable.  I DID NOT KNOW THAT!  Now I have two libraries. Something Amazon needs to work on. Just sayin'	1
"We've become board-book experts (snobs?!) over the last ten months. This is by far one of the nicer ""touch and feel"" varities out there. The feeley spots are large and visible for young babies and there is a nice variety of textures: terry cloth towel, sand paper, faux grass, deep shaggy fleece, silk leaves that crinkle, short fuzzy fleece. The pages are stiff ad sturdy, the spine/binding is well made. Colors are bright and photos are pretty. Our 10-month-old daughter loves this book! (...Now, if only it had ""lift and look"" flaps too, it would be perfect!)"	22
Sara Gruen's gorgeous new novel, WATER FOR ELEPHANTS, unfolds as a dual narrative, alternating between Jacob Jankowski's life as a nonagenarian, and his time spent working for a ragtag Depression-era circus as a young man. The plot is captivating (I missed two meals because I didn't want to put the book down) and Gruen's writing, as always, is transcendent. She deftly evokes a fascinating period in American history that deserves to be revisited, and her characters--human and animal alike--will stay with you long after you turn the last page.	5
I swear, I've tried so many different types of moisturizers that contain SPF in them but each one seems to leave my skin feeling oily or like I'm at the beach putting sun screen on my face. NOT cute! What I love about this product is that it contains sun screen but doesn't FEEL like you're wearing it. It literally just melts into your skin (well mine at least! Don't forget, everyone's skin is different). I use a bunch of Olay products & I have nothing but nice things to say. I love Olay!	4
M is an essential film. But this DVD was a little disappointing, I felt. The picture and sound were better than other versions I've seen, but still not as pristine as I would have liked. Special features were so-so. Price was as high as Criterion usually likes it. All in all, I've seen better adaptations of similarly legendary films to DVD.But if you are at all interested in the great films of the past, this is a must-have, and Criterion MUST be kept in business at all costs (wince). So this is a good buy overall.	6
This device has a major design flaw and does not prevent thieves from cutting it up.  I used this poorly designed lock on my macbook pro and the thief was still able to destroy the lock with a cutter.  Mind you, the lock portion was destroyed, not the cable.  The thief was able to yank out enough of a crease located between my laptop hole and the combo lock itself for his metal cutter to easily break its clippers.  Basically this device provides a false sense of security when contends to a thief with formidably-equipped metal cutter.	10
Bought this board along with Melissa and Doug wood and magnetic letters and numbers kit.  The size is great for my 2-year-old grandson to play with, and there are 2 sides to use.  This is a big hit in my home and will grow with children as they become more creative...great learning tool too.  I also bought a container of magnetic foam objects so we can work with his spelling as he has now mastered his letters and numbers.  I believe it is also compatible with dry-erase markers for older children.  I highly recommend this board...great size to travel with also.	22
I purchased the lower end version of this product, the TV Wonder VE. It has met all my needs in a TV Tuner card to go in the PCI slot of my low-end emachine.My emachine did come with a ATI video card, so I think that  made it really easy. It also accepts composite input, something I haven't  tried yet.Had a minor audio issue with this product. Called support, got  a stupid person once, helpful person the next time I called.Overall good  product, I assume the regular more expensive product is even better.	10
I had purchased a urinal for my husband on Amazon, and he asked me what he could clean it with.  So I got him this OXO good grips bottle brush.  While the bristles could come down a little farther on the handle, even if you were to use it for a baby's bottle, the bristles are very wide, (and flexible while still being sturdy), making it an asset to cleaning any kind of bottle at all. Again, a wonderful OXO product! (Get the impression I am a fan?).  He says he loves it, so five stars it is!	12
These headphones have excellent sound quality, especially in the Bass ranges. The foam pad is very comfortable and does not hurt my ear, even after hours. It requires a little more effort than most headphones to roll the cushion, put it in your ear canal, hold it and wait for it to expand, then carefully remove hand, but it pays off with noise reduction and great sound and a snug fit. The dark purple plastic is a little strange, and they do look funny, but that is a very minor detail. Great product.	10
Dragon Knights, Border Lair. Book 2 in the series. This book can be read alone, but is better if you start with the prequel The Dragon Healer or Book 1 Maiden Flight.  This book follows Belora's, Maiden Flight, mother Adora who has been reunited with her childhood friend and adopted mother Kelzy the dragon.  Adora finds love with her 2 Knights and there Dragon Partners.  The broad story line continues to unfold at a nice pace.  After reading this book, I was engaged enough in the story that I picked up the rest of the series to date, Keeper of the Flame.	14
I have the worst cramps every month. By this I mean the kind of cramps that make you want to stay in bed with a heating pad for the rest of the day. But this tea really helps to make them more bearable. I've found that it helps to start drinking the tea a couple of days ahead of time and for extra bad cramps I use two tea bags instead of one. As for the taste I actually like the spicy orange flavor, you can add a dash of cream to help tone down the spicy flavor if needed.	11
I love Alice in Chains.  I literally grew up on them.  This show just captures the essence of what Alice IS, to be honest.  Layne's little blooper on 'Sludge Factory' was a nice reminder that celebs are people, too, they're not perfect.  And I'm not one to cry at songs...but 'Nutshell' had me sobbing almost immediately.  If you don't have this DVD, you're really missing out.  It's probably my favorite DVD of all time.	6
I love, love, love this app.  I have always been fond of staring at the moon.  The image of the moon shows both sides of it.  It also shows the different phases as the beautiful moon waxes and wanes.  It also has a ton of technical information which goes right over my head but looks very cool.  There is also a calendar that shows where the phases each in every day, past to future.  I have it as my wallpaper and I am never bored with it.  I am totally satisfied with this app.	1
I bought this hub to connect the computers in my home so they could share a cable modem. I looked at a lot of 10Base-T hubs, and found this one to be among the least expensive with the best satisfaction ratings. I am especially impressed with the hub's small size and metal case -- other hubs are larger and have plastic cases.To me, the best recommendation for a piece of network hardware is that you never have to think about it, it just works. This hub gives me that in spades.	10
I looked at all the Hori-Horis available on Amazon and read all the reviews before settling on this one as a present for my girlfriend, an avid gardener. She was impressed by the quality, and likes how it can be used as a shallow trowel, a bulb planter, a perennial divider, a root cutter, and more. It's very handy in her garden, which borders on a nature preserve full of invasive plants. It's attractive and well made, too. I'd recommend it for any outdoor gardener.	18
I bought two pairs of these.  Size small, I'm 5'7&#34;, waist 32&#34;.  The fit is good, but I feel like the Under Armour boxerjocks offer much better compression.  Just a tight feel all around.  The problem with both is that they make me hot.  It's hard to wear these on a regular basis because they don't offer the breathing room like regular boxers do.  I was hoping that these ExOfficio boxers were a little &#34;cooler&#34;, but they were not.  I'll be wearing these to play sports, but not for daily use.	8
I put this item on my wishlist when it first came out because the premise sounded interesting and then I forgot about it until I saw it was released in paperback. I purchased it and was not let down. The story starts a little slow was you try to make sense of what is going on and whose exactly is this main character, but it takes off from there and I basically read the book in a day and some hours.  I highly recommend, as it really is a great story of time past and present.	5
My red eared slider has been eating these sticks for four years and he still loves them!  These sticks float on the surface of the water for a long time giving Turtle good opportunity to eat them before they sink.  Many online turtle forums claim this is the best turtle food.  I can't disagree.  I live in a dry climate so I bought the more economical large size which lasts for more than a year.  The only food Turtle likes better is live fish, which he gets every two-three weeks to give him exercise.	19
Overall this charger works great, the MicroUSB fits well, the cord is a perfect length, and it's a high current charger so my Nexus One charges fast (and doesn't discharge while running the GPS).  I've purchased two of these now, one for me (Nexus One) and one for my wife (HTC Aria).It lost 1 star because the plug part is _really long_ and the silly blue light.  It's actually quite bright and distracting at night, I have to turn the thing sideways at just the right angle.  I could cover it if I needed to, but turning it works.	7
Unless I can't find it (!) it would be great to have a battery level indicator on this device.  A micro USB connector version would be nice as well although the tiny Motorola Mini/Micro cable works.  I purchased this to work on my old Motorola phone but it also works on my new Android phone.Otherwise, this is small, sleek, lightweight and it does work.  The retractable connector takes a little fiddling with to keep it from sliding back into the charger - push the button forward and hold it while connecting to the phone - but once in it stays put.	7
As a Mom to 3 kids I'm not a fan of these quick meals really.  BUT on the other hand as an after school snack or a night time quick snack it's OK for the kids.  I think the smell is repulsive and the thought of eating dehydrated meat is NASTY but my boys LOVE this junk.  They eat it right up.  That's kids for you though, anything junky, hahaha.  If you're kids eat things like mac n cheese or hamburger helper in the skillet they will like this, it's just not for me personally.	11
Oh man, words dont do justice to how much I love this game.  I'm a huge fan of the series and this game does justice to the best show.  Doesnt matter how many people you have playing, each game is an epic story.  Unlike most games they even have a single player mode that I find myself playing just as much as I do with friends.  Each time we play we get better at the subtle rules and have more and more fun every time.  I highly recommend this to anyone who has watched and love the firefly show as much as me.	22
The best complient an actor can get is that his or her character is memorable, and you care about them. The best compliment a writer can get is that the stories are beleivable and unpredictable. This show is compliment rich. I'm not a fan of the big hair, y'all crowd but these are real people in real situations that are not overly dramatized. Each season does get better and as you know some characters are leaving the show, their exits are done realistically and without detachment. We started watching out of boredom and are now hooked. A great series!	0
I have been using one of those synthetic chammys for years. It finally started disintegrate, so I shopped for a replacement. I came across this. Even though I had my doubts about a &#34;towel&#34;, the price was good, so I decided to give it a try. It works great. Easily as good as my old synthetic chammy. A plus is I can throw it in the washer and it comes out like new. I should have bought two. (One for the wet dry and one for finishing.)	2
I have had insomnia all my life.  I take Unisom sometimes, but I don't like taking a pill to help me sleep.  I have been drinking this tea every night for a week and it really helps me to relax and sleep.  I have had some intense dreams after drinking this tea, but at least I am sleeping for once in my life. The taste is not unpleasant to me.  I love tea and this is not one I would drink for the taste, but it isn't bad.	11
One of the best fighters ever made, actually quite possible the best fighter ever made thus far. Graphics far superior to Tekken or Dead or Alive 2, this game rocks. There is so much to do, you unlock all kinds of good stuff by fighting like galleries of art new costumes, and levels to fight on and more. This game has great strategy in it as well as it is not like Marvel vs Capcom where you just push buttons and pull off random power moves. This game is exceptional and I own it since the Dreamcast debut!	23
i was a bit skeptical at first but it's a wonderful addition to eggs, chowders, anyplace you want a cheesy flavor that tastes like cheese and not a chemical. plus it is not salty. it's a true cheese flavor. this is a must have in my kitchen. just adding this: you can mix it with a buttery spread for a new twist on garlic bread, bake it in the oven for a few minutes, bread wrapped in foil at 350. my company could not get enough. i'm sure i'll come up with more uses. stay tuned.	11
I was very disappointed with Porter Cable.  The plunge mechanism sticks, the on button is hard to lock on for router table use, the depth gauge is extremely hard to use, and it is not compatible with most after-market accessories.  Mine is sitting on a shelf.  In its place is a DeWalt 621 plunge router.  It is lighter, has a much better depth gauge and is just better all around.  I love my DeWalt 621.  I wish I had bought it first.	21
my cat was ALWAYS waking us up at 3:30-5am to feed her! Instead of locking her out of the bedroom (where she will probably figure out how to do damage to punish us) the PetSafe electronic feeder is satisfying her now. only challenge is trying to program it for the exact times that will keep her satisfied. trial and error! but we'll get it down - it's easy to program when you have the routine. tip: keep a notepad with the feeding times and readjust them as needed, then reprogram intermittently.	19
Finally I can make mashed potatoes without using my mixer.  I am a quadriplegic/tetraplegic (C5-6 for thos who care) and I can use this tool.  Traditional potato mashers just require more grip than I have in my hand.  Plus the horizontal handle makes the pushing easier, as well.My mother  with mild arthritis likes this as well as her traditional masher.As with  most Oxo tools it is highly ergonomic: it fits the hand and does the job  it's supposed to.	13
well bought this so i could have a spare cord since i have the original cord in my car with a usb charger there got tired of keeping track where i had it last.  so this cord works on when plugged into the wall.  when hooked to a pc phone wont stay connected to the pc to transfer files or anything.  so if you just need a cord to plug into the wall this will work but don't even think of this cord if you want to use it with a pc.	7
A middle-aged momma's boy runs rampant in a movie theater cutting out patron's eyeballs, while the movie onscreen depicts the same man as an optometrist who is driven to his evil acts by his overbearing, overweight squeaky-voiced mother. (The film's movie-within-a-movie THE MOMMY).An interesting idea is well played out even if the end result is rather awkward. There is one funny scene of one of the victim's slobbering before having his throat slit with a scalpel. Presumably it's just a matter of taste. All in all, ANGUISH isn't a bad movie, I just expected it to be a lot better.	15
This brush cleans well and is large enough to easily clean wider wheels like 8 or 9inches wide.However, the downside is that the tip of the brush has the metal spine exposed and, if you're not careful, can damage the finish of your precious wheel if you're not careful when about to put it between the spokes.You can't really tell that from the pictures, and it may seem minor, but it takes a lot of thought each time you're about to clean your wheel to remember to be extra careful using it.	2
It's been about 3 years since this monster role-playing game came out and it's still in most people's top ten.This game totally redined the RPG once again like only the people at Interplay can do. Extremely detailed in every way possible. Graphics, sound, atmosphere, wilderness, monsters...there isn't a bad thing to say about this. Best of all, it has an engrossing story line that makes you want to keep playing (without sleep) for hours to get to the next chapter.A wonderful achievement!	23
Sure, any old spiral notebook will work fine.  But the Mead 5-stars really are better.  They are more durable, with a flexible plastic front cover, and a wire spiral that doesn't crush easily.  The back cover is just cardboard, but it is sturdy enough that you can write with this notebook on your lap or wherever.  The paper is nice and smooth, and perforated for cleaner tear-outs.  And there is nice little pocket page at the front, to tuck in other papers.	17
Paired with oatmeal, I have had more milk than my daughter can consume! I've been breastfeeding for 6 weeks now and this week is when I noticed a difference in my supply.  I added the tea maybe around week 2-3 and only a cup a day, so i don't even drink the recommended 3-4.  I didn't like the taste at first, but now I really enjoy the flavor, and almost crave it! Of course, I love that it's organic too!	11
"A fine singer-songwriter with a sweet, candy-coated voice that belies the 29 years old that she was when she made this album, Lisa Loeb first hit big with the song ""Stay"" from her 1995 album ""Tails,"" and established herself as a talented and heartfelt lyricist. This album, in my opinion, is best carried by songs like ""I Do"" and ""Falling In Love,"" which have sunny guitars and her most cheerful, upbeat singing, but even dark, brooding selections like ""Furious Rose"" and ""Jake,"" are beautifully written and sang with sincere, lilting angst."	9
For the money or even if you want to spend more money.You can't beat this belt for serveing it's purpose.Glad I read the reviews before buying it though.It will hold 25 12 gauge shells very snugly.Do what the guy says in his reveiw.Insert in every other loop and then fill in the empty loops.Also it can serve as a pistol belt at the same time.Just make sure before you load it to turn it so the long empty part is on the side you want to wear pistol on.	20
I usually read ingredient lists carefully, but I guess the name fulled me and I thought this product had some AHA's.  After using it for a while and not seeing or feeling any difference (AHA's should sting a bit) I checked and sure enough, despite the name, no AHAs.  I wanted a product with AHAs and think the company's name is deceiving on such a product.  I thought they only sold products with AHAs.  Perhaps they aren't doing this intentionally, but it is confusing and I wanted to let everyone know in case you were fooled too.	4
This game is addictive, and fun as hell to play!  THQ and JAKKS pulled out all stops when Wrestlmania was released!  Create and bet WWF championship belts with your friends.  Tons of game modes, including cage match, road to Wrestlemania, Create-A-PPV, Royal Rumble, Triple Threat, Hardcore, First Blood Matches, Lumber Jack Matches, Singles, Tag Team,etc.  Create-A-Wrestler with custom moves, Costumes, and fighting styles.  WWF entrances complete with Titantron and theme music, thousands of singnature moves, taunts and mannerisms.  Over 50 of the top WWF superstars, and much much more!	23
"I don't know why people are not raving about ""Leverage"" in the same breath they use on ""Weeds"" or ""The Wire,"" ""Mad Men,"" or other great cable TV series.  ""Leverage"" has a terrific (if incredible) premise, a wonderful cast, and among the best writing on TV.  It combines the fun of the classic Robert Wagner series ""It Takes a Thief"" with the witty dialog of ""Buffy, the Vampire Slayer"" to create a perfectly entertaining and engaging confection.  This is television of the first rank, and this DVD set makes for extremely addictive viewing."	0
This stuffed frog is for &#34;small&#34; dogs, and I mean small. It is very small, and my dog is 12 lbs, and she loves it. She loves tiny toys. I estimate this toy is best for mini-pets like Chihuahua or small (under 10 lbs). I didn't actually see this one from Amazon because I ordered it for my best friend's new puppy who live in CA. I saw this at Petsmart and loved it. It is very cute, and from memory, it is about 3+ inches tall. The fur is soft, and I believe it also has a squeak in it.	19
This product is an excellent treatment to prevent fungal infections in fish.  That said, it also does a nice job of killing plants and, due to the copper in the product, killing invertibrates (snails, shrimp, worms...).  I've also read that this stuff has medicinal value if you have a fungal infection in the brain.  (Yes, apparently this can happen.)  However, I wouldn't endorse or recommend the purchase of this product for that purpose, or attempting self-treatment without doctor supervision.	19
While I haven't tried every peppermint tea available, I have tried a half dozen or so of the ones I can readily get, and have found this one to be the best.I have tried other teas from Traditional Medicinals, and consider them to be one of the very best tea vendors in the market. I have never been disappointed in any of their products,and always look for them first if I am trying to find an herbal tea.Peppermint has many beneficial effects, and this is a great way to get that into your diet. Add a little steviaRecommended.	11
This a a brilliant album from Toni. Beautiful ballads throughout and her voice is so soothing and sultry. My particular favourites are &quot;Un-break my heart&quot; and &quot;How could an Angel break my heart&quot;, but all songs are good. This is an album I can listen to over and over again...beautiful. The 24 page booklet contains all lyrics and plenty of photos of Toni. If you're looking for an album for a romantic dinner or 'something', then look no further. Track #12 though, I think is a trick...it doesn't exist.	9
I bought these headphones at a Tower Records about 2 years ago.  They are nice in that you can fold them and put them in a big pocket or purse and carry them to the gym.  Today I couldn't hear anything out of the right side so I'll need to toss them.  I was shopping around on Amazon and noticed the other review with the similar problem so I thought I'd add to it, seeing that it may be a common problem with this model.  I had only paid around $10-$15 in the first place.	10
I loved this movie, it would be a GREAT movie to show to a Youth group at church as I believe this movie teaches not only about Hosea, but it has a GREAT message about acceptance and how we all are going through things at one time or another and how we should not judge others because of their seemingly standoffishness.... (if this is a word).... I was shy as a young teen, and was going through things at home.... had no friends and I could relate to this girl..... thank you Beverly Patton	15
I could not put this book down.  Maybe it's because I love history, and this novel is so very rich with it. Or maybe it's because I've always been a hopeless romantic, rooting for people who shouldn't be in love to find their happy ending.  Or maybe it's my penchant for heroes who are thrust into unfamiliar territory, in this case the circus world, and have to find their way.  Whatever...this book stayed with me long after I finished it, and that's the best kind of read of all.	5
I have used these filters in Betta bowls and small tanks for many years, and they are just perfect  for the Bettas.  I don'tnecessarily run it all the time since Betta fish like calm water, so a few hours per day does the job!  You just pull out thedirty filter and pop in the clean one  (rinse under water first).  They can last  2 or 3 weeks.  When you clean the bowl ortank you can take the filter holder out and clean it up, so you don't have to buy the whole assembly each time, just thecartridges.	19
"If you are fan of the Jazz III you will definitely like the Ultex version.  From my experience, the Ultex has the sound and feel of Tortex but without the ""memory"" aka wear.  The Ultex is thicker than the standard nylong Jazz III's and only when directly compared will you notice that the Ultex version has a slightly larger gripping surface.Five stars for being a better Jazz III.  However, the prices for these on amazon are absurd.  I got mine through musiciansfriend for around $2 shipped."	16
I bought these for my husband for a snorkeling trip. These are his favorite shoes. Even after walking in water, the feet immediately feel dry once out of the water. They never smell, which is different from other water sandals. The toes are secure, the bottoms heavy and well made, and the inner cord is easily adjusted to provide a good fit. Even after getting them dirty with mud, they wash off easily with water and look like new. He even wears them with socks now that the weather is colder. A very well-made shoe/sandal.	8
Purchased this around Thanksgiving last year and my son (age 4) LOVED 'elf' - as he so creatively named it LOLeven now, in march, hes still talking about 'Elf'there were several times elf forgot to move, and we decided tht sometimes he liked a spot so much he stayed there a couple of days! LOLi loved finding different ways to hide him - he hung upside down from our kitchen chandelier... hid in xmas tree branches... on top of the curtain rod...even on top of the ceiling fan! My son loved coming out to find him each morning!	22
This is one game that will test your skills, on how to figure things out, but if you want to take the easy way out you can always get bottles the neer sighted mole's help. One thing i like about this game is that when Bottle & Kazooie confront each other they always throw smack at each other which makes the storyline more funnier. This is a pretty cool game, it's worth buying. I had fun playing it, i will buy it.If you liked this game check out all of the other Banjo & Kazooie games.	23
"Much better produced and a shining example of the uncharted (and, unfortunately, unnoticed) path to technicality-without-pomposity that Coronor was soon traveling, 1989's No More Color is a great stop-gap to the near-perfection of Mental Vortex.  ""Die By My Hand"" is a absolutely killer opener leading into a treasure trove of monster riffs that does not let up for the rest of the album. An essential thrash document from a band you've probably never heard of but most likely will never forget."	6
Monk's 7th is just as hilarious and entertaining as the previous seasons. Adrian Monk is still miserable and continues to help Captain Stottlemeyer and Disher with solving murders, with the help of his devoted Assistant, Natalie. Monk is forced to find a new therapist because Dr. Kroger has died. Throughout this season Monk matches wits with a chess player, helps a boxer, gets stuck on a submarine underwater, meets his other brother, fights City Hall, and much more. I highly recommend MONK: SEASON SEVEN!!!	0
Derek is one of the best keyboardists.  This is some of his best work.  However, I enjoy his work with Dream Theater, and Planet X better.  The whole slew of musicians that play on this album doesn't really impress me.  Um Derek, how is it that you can only get one song or so out of each of these musicians?  Anyway, if you want to know who the greatest musicians are in the biz today, this album is a good introduction to them.	6
BUT NOT ANYMORE!!! This product is awesome. I put just a wee bit in my bathwater and voila!! Gets to places I was too lazy to reach. I'm not itchy from this terribly dry winter we're having and my skin doesn't feel tight. I love to also use this oil as a massage oil. There's no fragrance which I like because it allows me to put on perfume without feeling too scented.Pros:Not greasy in the bathtubHydratingSoothing for itchy dry skinSpreads easilyAbsorbs quicklyCons:Can get a little priceyMust...have....more.....	4
We bought this gate for a opening between our foyer and kitchen. We ended up buying one extension and are very pleased!!! We put it together in about 30 minutes. It's great because you can bend it into whatever configuration you need. For us, we were hesitant to drill into our walls but didn't have another solution. Now that it's installed, we definitely feel like the safety and convenience factors far outway the problem of drilling into our walls.  I definitely recommend this gate!!	3
I got a free sample of these with a firearm cleaning kit a while back, and I finally ran out, so time to get more.  They're great - reasonably strong material saturated with a nice lubricating oil, and more than enough to complete a job with one wipe.  They're good for much more than guns, though - anything that needs a light layer of oil to prevent rust and keep surfaces sliding smoothly against each other - hand tools, in particular seem to like these.  I'm still finding uses for them, and one wipe goes a long way.	20
"Good construction, good enamel finish. Stores easily in van and is a labor saving device, especially when transporting white boards or sheet goods down long hallways. Easy to push and steer from far end of sheet goods, without touching the troll handle once the troll is loaded up. I've never seen anything like this product. I highly recommend it for transport over smooth surfaces, such as inside buildings.2012 update, This device is one of a kind. I've still use it for very heavy doors and panels. It is top notch with no failures of wheels or structure.  This is a ""cool"" tool !"	21
Should I be complaining about something that was less than a dollar?Yes, absolutely.The top layer of material, the red layer, is coming off from both the top and bottom of the muse pad after about a week's worth of normal use. The adhesive or bonding process isn't holding the two layers together.The size of the mouse pad is very good.It tends to slide around on my desk with very little effort.Waste of time with this mouse pad. Surprised at the lack of quality from Belkin.	17
"I received the cage yesterday and at 7:30 AM today I caught the first squirrel. The cage is solid and well-made. The animal has to enter and step on the triggering mechanism to close the door cage. This is a good quality of cage because I have tested that even a light-weight animal such as a squirrel can trigger the door close. (I have another, smaller cage that can be easily triggered without stepping into the cage. It can be frustrating to find the door was shut with no animal inside). I submitted two photos under ""Pikmin"" name."	18
While I love and trust D'Addario strings, i am subtracting one star because, I really like the packaging for other strings when they have individual packets.  For my acoustics, I do not always change out all the strings at once.  I think the bass strings get changed more when they start falling off on sound.Anyway, these are classic strings that I grew up with, but as I get more involved with playing, having the flexibility of individual envelopes for each string becomes more an d more appreciated.  Especially if you like to save your single strings for use.	16
I had a Samsung X427 before this and it was awful. Dropped calls, poor reception, wouldn't hold a charge. This phone changed my opinion completely. It does everything I need and then some, and the camera/video is a bonus. The only downside and the difference between 4 & 5 stars was that it did not behave well with my Jabra EarWrap-the remote button did not work-and the speakerphone is a joke. But speakerphone is not really what I needed, it was reliability and function.Really a far step forward-I recommend it for anyone needing a reliable phone.	7
"Had this and now have an ART 341 EQ for $99.  No comparison!  ART is actually DJ/real quality with unbalanced RCA jacks for home use as well as the balanced jacks for pro use.Ultra-quiet, high quality potentiometers, discrete 2-channels with output control, clipping indicators, 6 or 12 db scale select for each channel.  Ground lift select for possible source grounding problems.Just need to buy 4 rubber adhesive feet for home shelf mounting, rather than rack mounting.  Comes without feet and rack ears for 19"" rack.  Much nicer EQ than this Audio Source junk, and I've owned both."	10
I recieved a similar model to this walker, one without the electronic tray, for my daughter.  My only complaint is the rear wheels are difficult to roll.  Unlike the front wheels, the rear wheels are fixed and therefore can only roll straight forward or backward, not side to side.  This sometimes made for difficult maneuvering for my daughter. Overall, it is not a bad walker and I do plan on using it for my next baby due in January only because I do not want to purchase another one.  I would not recommend it though.  There are better walkers out there.	3
This was great, until it wasn't.  Even though I had the problems with the noisy impeller, after I put a little vasoline on it it stopped the noise.  Everything was fine until I came home today to do my weekly maintenance and the filter was dead!  I know it was working last week when I did a water change but I have no idea when it quit working.  Fortunately I have two filters running so my fish are ok. This filter only lasted six months so I'm very disappointed.	19
This is the ONLY razor I've ever found that can cut through my husband's beard.  No, I don't live with Grizzy Adams, but he's close! :)  Life without these is just ridiculous - he has to shave 3 times a day with any other razor.  Really, no kidding.  This razor not only does an outstanding job, but it doesn't cut up his face in the process. I cannot say enough good about this razor.  He's been using them for 12 years and won't be without them.  Highly, highly recommend!	12
"These are great, functional labels at a very reasonable price.  The 2x4-inch size is big enough for hand-written addresses and still fits 10 to a sheet for economy's sake, many more labels per sheet than the slightly larger sizes without much loss of usability.  The ""TrueBlock"" ability to hide what's behind them -- seemingly due to a gray layer behind the labels' white surface, like primer under a coat of paint -- is nice, though this was never a real problem for other labels to begin with.  Simply put, these work great for their purpose."	17
It's rare that you get a product that exceeds your expectations.  This is one of those cases.I make a lot of salads and was really getting tired of waiting for the lettuce to dry.  This thing spins so fast and for so long after a few pushes of the button, it's amazing.  I took out my Arugula and spinach, and couldn't believe how dry it was.  the amount of water I poured out that had been removed was impressive.Honestly, it's great to see a product do what it's supposed to do, so well	13
"Looks very cool.  Very convenient charging via USB port.  Not so good sound quality.  Audio has a lot of static tics and pops and that is the only reason I give this 2 stars.  Everything else is great.Pairs quickly with my Nextel i870.I lost my Plantronics 510, so will fall back to this unit until I can find the latest earpiece that has received good reviews.  Other may have a great experience with this earpiece.  Unfortunately, I am not one of them.  Maybe I got a ""bad"" one."	7
This holds magazines fine and has a adjustment screw for the tension.What lets it down are the two poppers which fix it to the belt. They are so hard to pop on and off it takes considerable effort and contortion to mount it on your belt.Update: After many iterations of putting it on and taking it off it has loosened up enough that I'd bump the star rating from 3 to 4. The tension screw has a tendancy to back out over time but is easy to tighten back up. I guess some locktite would fix it.	20
This band is like the Earth, Wind and Fire for the Gen-X generation: this album slams from start to finish!!! I mean, &quot;What Kind Of Man...&quot; is just the JAM!!! I also love &quot;Change Your Mind&quot;, &quot;Gettin'  It On&quot;, &quot;Let Be The One&quot;, &quot;You Don't Have To  Hurt...&quot; This band has such warm, impassioned vocals, and the tracks  are tightly arranged. Get this CD if you think that R&amp;B is dead, and  rejoice at these brothers that can bring about its rebirth. Give this band  its props and buy this CD NOW!!! Support the real!!!	9
"We have tried this product several times and found ""IT DOES NOT DISSOLVE"" as advertised. (Camco 2 Ply RV & Marine Toilet Tissue)It plugs up against the gate valve so when you open it to dump, the ""solids"" and the tissue cannot come through.We have had our Black Tank Line snaked twice due to this product plugging up against the drain line gate valve. (and yes we use the appropriate chemicals)""Do Not"" use this product in your RV. Try ""Thetford"" brand. Although only single ply, it will not plug up your sewer line and it dissolves as advertised."	2
I got this, along with some shark teeth for a little boy (5).  He was going to spend the day with me and my old lady friends.  What do I do with him?  Well, along with a million other things (food, making a mess, tormenting my cat, touching anything lightly colored with filthy hands, wiping his snotty nose on my silk couches...) I had this for him.  He enjoyed the project, we did it in stages, and it was nice for him to have a 'take away' when his mother finally came.	22
I live in a studio condo and I needed something to rotate to see from my bed and my couch on the other side of the main room. Once you figure out which instructions to use (several varieties are included to accommodate different scenarios and tvs), they are pretty thorough. Don't be afraid to tighten specific &#34;joints&#34; and loosen others to get it how you want it.Originally had bought a different one, and be careful of this, but it didn't didn't have near the amount of swing as this one does.	10
The musical sounds don't sound like the real instruments, they just sound like a cheap toy. Also, I thought each instrument would play its own melody, how it would in a real orchestra. For example, the horn would play the background, the flute a lighter melody, then all the instruments would combine to create the true melody when the orchestra button is pressed. But really, each button plays exactly the same notes except with a different instrument.  I was really disappointed, and my daughter prefers the music buttons from her Tiny Love Activity Center. The ones on that toy are really neat.	3
If you are a big SRV fan you'll  be happy to have this.  Is it top quality?  Does it include as many songs/performances as I'd like? No and No.  However, I am thrilled to have this.  Even before he got clean, SRV just knew how to perform each and every time because the music came from deep within him.  I am so glad he sobered up and was able to help others.  He is an inspiration as a musician and a insightful human being.  Glad he lives on despite leaving us in physical form.	6
I bought this for my son for his birthday.  Wow, is it easy and delicious.  A person could be in real trouble with this ice cream maker sitting around.We first made the vanilla recipe and it was better than wonderful...just a few ingredients into the bowl and away you go.  Fat City is on the horizon.  I love it.  Thank goodness my son lives 1000 miles away or I would be in real trouble with this little machine.  The price is good and the ice cream is wonderful.  Wonderful gift.	13
It's not all that sophisticated of an App, but it serves the purpose.  But it works great for me because I use several phones (one for each region I frequently travel to) and it's nice to have my music with me whenever I want to play them.  Best part of it is I don't have to load down the already limited memory of my phones with the entire library.  I can just stream the playlist (or artist, album, etc.) that I want to listen to.	1
I tried Chevron Techron as people recommended here: meaning filled up it twice and also filled out my engine with Tufoil Engine Treatment and my mpg didn't improve at all.I drive 09 Accord EX-L V6 and constantly getting around 20mpg on 91/93 octane fuel driving from Brooklyn to Long Island on Belt  & Cross Island Parkways. Mileage is horrible because there is never a steady speed and often traffics, but even when there is no traffic - still horrible 20mpg. I do write this review after 3 full tanks that were filled after 2 Chevron Techrons.	2
Great Game.  If you like bluffing, like poker, or confrontation games like Risk or Axis and Allies, this game is at the top of the class.  The main rule is that your alien character somehow circumvents and or otherwise breaks a rule or rules in the game.  The rules and the way the game plays allows for interesting player interaction.If you are looking for a game to get for someone that likes the bluffing and ante aspect of Poker then you will like this game.  Give it a try it's a classic and it's worth every penny.	22
A fascinating film documentary of a signicant historical event.  Funny, poignant, and compelling.  The musical performances varied in quality.  Country Joe and the Fish, The Who, Santana and Jimi Hendrix were the standout performances.  I know The Who were not that happy about the show, but given they went on around sunrise it speaks more to the quality of what they were capable of at that point in their history.  I loved the announcements and audience interviews. Obvious accomadations were made to get the quality of sound and video up to Blu-ray snuff but well worth the editing in the end.	6
Another great read in this series. I absolutely loved the first one and had to have the second and I was not disappointed. If anything it had only hooked me on this series even more. I love the characters and how everything interacts and flows together. It's written really well and I'm able to just immerse myself in the story and the world that has been created and I don't want to leave, even when the book is done. There is plenty of action in this story to keep your attention.  Now to get the next one :).	14
"Intricately woven between past and present this is the story of Callie McGuire / ""Mischief"" who was abducted by gypsies and then sold to Judgement along with other captives who are sadistically beaten into trained submission to then be sold around the globe or like a few such as Mischief,  kept to become a Personal for the Masters at Judgement.  ""Judgement"" is primarily the story of Tane and Mischief which spans nearly ten years.  Ruthless does not begin to describe the treatment of the slaves.  Very well written and very hard to put down."	14
I'd been wanting to try this brand since it's BPA free, but it's been hard to find in town.  I recently purchased a few packages and used one in a vegetable soup the other night.  The tomatoes gave good color to the soup and greatly enhanced the flavor.  Last night I made chili from scratch, cooked the dried beans, the whole nine yards and added these tomatoes to the mix.  My chili turned out extra yummy.  I'm so glad I finally got to try the tomatoes.  I'm going to stock up so I don't run out.	11
I used it for a few years but alas, probably because the fleas acquire resistance, it no longer works. I've switched to Advantix and it does. Of course, I'm concerned, societally, that as with antibiotics, it's an endless battle. I hope we keep developing effective (and safe!) flea controls and antibiotics, but it's hard to remain optimistic that we always will. Of course, the world may well have ended before then--for example, some terrorist scientist creating a highly communicable mutated smallpox virus that he released in a public place.	19
I am 8 1/2 D, and I got the medium size. It fits well. There is a size chart printed on the box, that doesn't correspond to any of the charts on Woodlore's web site. However, I found a chart in the description for the Allen Edmunds shoe tree that is the same as the one on my box (AE makes Woodlore shoe trees). You can find it here:http://images.amazon.com/images/G/01/shoes/email/MensCombinationShoeTree.gifIf you have a narrow or wide shoe, it's a lot more accurate.This is a great shoe tree at a great price.	8
i think that so2 is one of the most enjoyable experience on the playstation.it has a unique skill system,very lovable charcters,interesting story,nice graphics..i love it and i'm still playing it till now.perhaps the worst thing about the game(although it's not that bad and some like challenges)is the dungeons ,sometimes they seem a bit long and altough i like battling especially with fighters..it can be a little bit tiring sometimes.so I recommend using the gameshark code for saving anywhere and beating the game will be a piece o cake^_^	23
I had heard about Diatomaceous Earth or DE Powder from friends so I thought I would give it a try. I had an army of ants invade my kitchen while I was away on vacation so It was the oerfect opportunity to put DE to the test. I put a trail of DE along their path and within days they were gone! It's been 2 wks and I haven't seen a single ant. I would deffinately recommend DE as a safe and effective alternative to poisons. I mean,who wants poisons in their kitchen anyway?	18
Everyone complains about their job, but somehow the produces came up with a series that makes you hope someday they would put your dirty job on the show. Even if they never put your's on the air, it is well worth watching it, a good lesson to remind everyone of what real hard labor is. We forget what it is like to do these dirty but necessary jobs, my only regret is that they never had rich and famous people who never worked a day in their life or got their hands dirty to guest hosting the show. LoL	0
We wish coffee tasted as good as it smells but have never found any that does.  This smells delicious and is ok but a lot weaker than we're used to.  Since the little cup-pod type single cup makers coffee is way too strong for all of us this was a more sensible alternative.  We'll keep trying to figure a way of making it stronger without being too strong.  Two discs didn't work.  All in all, it's a better coffee than we get trying to make one cup in a 12-cup coffee maker.  ;)	11
A very good collection of folk tales from Britain.  The author tried hard to make sure that the stories were commonly from Britain though they may have spread elsewhere or a variation came from elsewhere.  Some very English folk tales?  Henny Penny, Jack and the Beanstalk,  there are many Jack tales, and The Three Bears.  Most have humourous endings and seem to be stories to amuse everyone.  Jacobs,  the author said he used fairy tales in the title because no kid ever asks for a folk tale.	14
I only recently discovered Foyle's War. A unique look at police work in England during World War II. Cast and character development was excellent. An engrossing tale, each episode almost a stand-alone show in itself. Like a real page-turner of a book, this will keep you occupied until the very end. Having just finished the final episode in series 6, I can only say that I am really disappointed that there are no more episodes at this time. I could watch this show from now on. Foyle's War certainly has earned its 5-star rating from this old man.	0
All right, we today became beneficiaries of a free coffee maker from Senseo, thanks to a generous tip from a favorite of my Amazon friends.But this brand of coffee packets that came with the machine is nothing to write home about. At retail, the packs cost about 23 cents, if we order enough to avoid shipping charges.The smell of this fresh-brewed coffee is fantastic. The taste is less than I had hoped for. I think I'll try Target's Archer Farms, as suggested by another reviewer.	11
Make no mistake, this will kill mid sized rodents right quick. And they'll even snap a few fingers if you're not careful while setting them. The spring is very strong. This old school style trap is still the best solution by far. Yup, you're gonna see the dead rodent laying there, staring at you with that blank, lifeless look in it's eyes. But it gets the job done. Just be careful not to put it anywhere pets or kids can trip it by accident. A trap this strong will definitely hurt if tripped accidentally. I find peanut butter works best.	18
"I got rather excited when this arrived and the original BBC narrator was listed in the credits on the back cover.  Alas, no, this is merely a repackage of the original A&E box set, replete with Diane Sawyer's ""American"" narration and 4x3 (not original widescreen) AR.  Perhaps one day, when A&E's license expires, the BBC will release the original series in widescreen.  Hey, it's already happened with SCHAMA'S HISTORY OF BRITAIN!  Why do the networks try to ""Americanize"" these BBC series? Hell, even the BBC coddled us with Oprah's narrated version of LIFE.  I opted for the Attenborough version instead....at least I had that option."	15
I have always struggled cleaning my tea pot and my Nalgene water bottles.  I would stuff washcloths into them and spin them around but I never felt like I was doing a good job.  I saw this cheap little brush on amazon and figured I'd give it a go.  This brush helps me all the time now.  It can squeeze into the holes my hand can't fit in and I can move it around and scrub the insides.  I am impressed with this brush and am very glad I found it.	12
I expected a War story about U-Boats in WWI what I got was love story about a young girl and a fledgling U-Boat captain. The author, whoever it was, captured the essence of the aristocratic German officer. It was interesting how his attitudes toward the war and country were affected by his love for Zoe. There is a little bit of U-Boat combat action but that is a mere sideshow to the love story. Not a War story involving lots of action, but not a bad little love story.	14
When you open the package for this bench, it's intimidating because there are so many bolts and such.  Also, the instructions are not helpful at all. Fortunately, my husband is pretty good at assembling products, but if that's not a skill that comes intuitively for you, you might have a hard time with this.  Also, I hope your wrists are strong or that you have some sort of electric drill; assembling this requires a lot of wrist use.Once put together, though, it seems sturdy and looks nice(I'm surprised at all the reviews to the contrary; I'm quite picky, and I think it looks fine).	18
The Acer Aspire Netbook is sold with Windows XP operating system.  This DVD/CD burner is sold with the Windows ME driver, a generation behind the XP.  I tried downloading an updated driver from Microsoft, no go.  I tried contacting cBear, hoping they would support their product, NOTHING!  $25 paperweight is now what I have.  Amazon should drop cBear as a re-seller.  (It's not Microsoft's job to support cBear's hardware, it's cBear's job to support their product.  Not even ansering my email is not acceptable.)	10
I simply can't live without this WONDER.I LOVE clean floors, and I could just not do it on my own. I have two cats, a three year old boy and a husband who is in construction.  I also have 1100 square feet of tile and wood floors..........I'd MOVE out if it weren't for my Hoover!  I clean every weekend, it probably takes me about two hours to do the whole house - I vacumn first, then go over it all again using the wet scrub - my floors SPARKEL (for about a day!)You've got to get one.....	12
I've always played on light gauge strings and really wanted more sound out of my guitar so I found these and just took a gamble on this medium/light set and I was not disappointed. There was an immediate notice in sound difference and also the playablility of my guitar became a little more challenging. They offer a very warm tone with very good balance overall throughout the strings. I've always liked Ernie Ball strings and these were a great starter set for me to upgrade to. Would recommend to any level of guitar player!	16
When I first played this game 5 years ago I was blown away by its reality and detail. It was a RPG brought to exceptionally detailed life. Today's games have left Diablo behind, but I still never did manage to beat it with the Sorceror character who was just too darn weak. Despite its age, and &quot;primitive&quot; technology, this game is still worth its low price because it can provide a couple of weeks of entertainment before it is beaten. Diablo II is definitely worth getting after this one and has lots of terrific add-ons, and the WarChest is a great deal overall.	23
After a small amount of screwing around the H500 connected with myNokia N75 without a hitch.  I find that if you firmly place the earloop around the base of the ear and then fold in the receiver in fitsfirmly and doesn't come loose.  I agree that the volume could go higher;however, in a quiet room it is adequate.  I'm told that I'm clearlyheard on the other end of the connection.  This is also in a quiet room.Small and lite.  I think this a rather nifty piece of gear.	7
We bought Hi-Ho Cherry-o and Trouble for my son's 4th birthday, and while he enjoys both, Trouble is more fun for the adults to play. My son is old enough to push the pop-o-matic as long as he's perched high enough on his chair.He's been fantastic about waiting for his turn, and counting out the spaces. In fact, I thought he'd get mad that he couldn't go around the board until he got a &quot;6&quot; but he was amazingly patient! (Keep in mind a player could miss out on the ENTIRE game if they never roll a six.) I'm glad we bought it.	22
This is my go to pill for acid reflux prevention.  When I (gasp) eat or drink too much, this puppy stills the roiling waters and keeps things where they belong.  It has been a really long time (not long enough) since I grossly over did my consumption however I still (rarely) over do it and this helps a great deal.  In addition I find that when my allergies are severe and post nasal drip is flowing briskly, this helps to keep my stomach from adding insult to allergy injury.  A good product.	12
Chipmunks are cute, but not when they're digging up your plants and undermining your sidewalks.  We bought the Havahart trap a few weeks ago and after experimenting with the bait, we've been catching around one a day. Pecan butter works best.  Just put some pecans in your food processor, and add a little olive or vegetable oil.  They seem to like it more than peanut butter.  Be sure to drop your chipmunks off far, far away (like 4 or 5 miles) or they'll be back!	18
I've tried saving money and buying off-brand or store-brand wrapping tape.  If you've ever been frustrated with tape that doesn't tear properly, or that dispenses erratically, you know what I mean.  The price of this Scotch wrapping tape isn't much more than the bargain brands, so why buy something inferior that will perform poorly and look unprofessional?  This is the tape to buy for the holidays.  Cuts smoothly, nearly invisible, and makes presents look good.  Can't find any reason not to give this product the five stars it deserves.	17
I suspect this battery is not new. If it is then it's defective. I'd bet this was a refurbished battery. This battery best performance equaled the performance of my original battery after I had it about a year. At best, it performed OK but nothing like a new battery. BTW - I purchased this battery in Aug 2011, I'm again looking to purchase it's replacement because one again, I find myself having to charge it on average twice per day.I will say I received the battery quickly. Kudos to the seller for that.	7
Why ruin a good book with sex scenes?This was a hard book to read, but that was to be expected- it's very depressing subject matter.  It was well handled, though, fairly well written for the most part. I would give it a 3 or 4 star rating, if it wasn't for the 2 sex bits. They didn't fit the rest of the story, and pulled me out of it completely. Unnecessary, ill-suited to the story. If not for that, this would have been a good story from a unique viewpoint.	14
This is a great app but I lose quite often and run out of money fast.  I wish there was a faster and easy way to get free money.  If I run out of money I would have to wait 4 hours to get another 100 free coins and that 100 coin would last 10 minutes at best for me before I run out again.  To make the game more fun they need to incorporate a social component to the game with some type of achievements you can accomplish rather than simply level up.	1
I know some people say this may or may not work well. But for me it worked really well, I let the lotion sit on my skin for 10 minutes and found that to be a good time. Removes hair smoothly and painlessly. The smell of it is ok, but then again I just wash myself after I use it, just because. But overall great product but the tube runs out quicker than you think, so if you really want to be using this product a lot, I would suggest two or three bottles.	12
These cartridges are somewhat pricey. This fluid keeps my Braun razor working perfectly. I think it is now about five years old, and works as well as it did the first day. The razor was expensive at the time, so slightly expensive cleaning cartridges are to be expected. Given the grunge that's in the bottom of these cartridges at the end of their life, I'd never try to replace the fluid myself. I think the whole idea of saving a few pennies on an expensive shaver like this is a false economy.	12
Sup dawg. Let's be serious here. I am not in any way the God who made Nintendo. I am however the God of BattleTanx. From exploding nukes, to mini howitzers, to the Flash being incarnated into a Tank. This game has it all. Call of Duty ain't got a thing on this beauty. You can kidnap queens, you can dominate the world map, you can even stand around like a pacifist and let yourself die. This game has what YOU want. This game has what YOU need. YOU MUST OBTAIN BATTLETANX!	23
Good:  (1) heavy, beefy, and stable clamp on wood (2) good line alignment visibility.  Could be better, but still is good.  There is a port on the side that allows you to view the white line to align with your wood marking.Bad:  The jig arrived with the center dowel guide (black part in the middle) loose.  I did not know that, and hole wiggled.  I had to tighten up the jig with an allen wrench to make it usable.  This product should have gone through quality check before sending out in this incomplete condition.	21
I read this book in about a week and a half and I don't have much time to read. After the negative reviews, I was waiting for it to let me down but I never got there. I was interested through the whole thing and wanted to know what was going to happen next.I read it for a book club selection and was happy with the book. Not sure I want to see the movie depending on what I hear about the animal abuse. I don't think I could take it.Great read and I will recommend to others.	5
This sterile eyewash helps my dogs with his dry eye.  Once a friend was putting it in, I asked why do you do that? she said her eye itches ... so I keep a watch on my Westie, Marco Polo and wipe away his 'goop' and use the wash.  I used to use specific drops for dry eye ... but this has the same effect.It's a large bottle that you just tip, don't squeeze and the drop comes out.  Great price compared to the tiny ones.	12
With the included attractant I caught one yellowjacket.  They preferred to go to the hummingbird feeder and when I took the feeder down they flew away.  Using apple juice I caught some even with the feeder up and more when I took the feeder down.  They live for several days and most of them eventually escaped at night.  Next year I will put this in the refrigerator each night to chill the yellowjackets, kill them while they are torpid, and then put it back up.  Apple juice worked in the fall but something else might be required in the spring.	18
PET SOUNDS.....hauntingly beautiful,stunningly majestic,fantastically..oh look wait a minute!!lets cut to the chase!!REPEAT AFTER ME.I MUST OWN THIS ALBUM,I MUST OWN THIS ALBUM....or sadly yes youve guessed it it means booking an appointment in the funny farm.Youve probably got SGT PEPPER right?well this came before and it was instrumental in THE BEATLES recording said masterpiece.BRIAN WILSON never really came near to this quantum leap project again bits of SURFS UP are ok HOLLAND has a few gems but this is the ONE.So.....REPEAT AFTER ME I MUST OWN ..................	9
I did the perimeter of my home garden which in previous year had been a feeding ground for the small deer in my area.  So far, I haven't had any problems with deer. The two rabbits in the are stay away too.  I don't really care about squirrels.The battery powered sprayer is a nice feature.  It's much better than having to pump it by hand or use a trigger.The scent isn't too bad and the product lasts at least 6-8 weeks.Keep in mind that a little goes a long way.	18
This Wilton book is awesome.  My local craft shop did not offer the fondant course when I wanted to take it so I decided to teach myself.  I followed the lessons in the book and my fondant cakes have improved greatly.  In my area the Wilton Method instructors are not so great so I am happy I was able to save the money on the class but still get all of the wonderful Wilton advice.  I would definitely recommend not only buying this book, but seeing how much you can teach yourself before spending the money on the class.	13
This is one of my most used apps.  I seem to manage to have to look up at least a word a day and this little app makes it easy.The best part about this program is it automatically try's to fix your spelling of a word.  To me, that is so refreshing because chances are, if I am looking up a word, I don't know how to spell it!Just realize that you need to be connected to the internet to get to the data.  Good luck!	1
This controller has to be one of the worst out on the market.  It has a horrible design, is made of cheap plastic, and to make matters worse, it's  also highly priced.  Don't even think about using it for games like Marvel  Vs. Capcom, because even casual play will break this controller.  If you're  serious about games, find an import controller made by another company.  Don't even bother with the other Dreamcast controllers out in America, they  are all just as bad, if not worse.	23
I bought the VHS and subsequently DVD of this performance because of Nina.To me,she is currently the most accomplished classical ballet dancer.( hopefully she does not retire soon ).She has solid foot-works and always dances with great confidence.Her upper torso is so soft and expressive.This performance is of no difference.The only criticism I have is that the recording/video quality is not the best I've seen.It's ashamed that none of her performances of full length ballet at the ABT was recorded.That would have left us with important documents of what great classical ballet dancing should be.Brava Nina.	6
I have several shimano spinning reels in different sizes. They are great. The drags are easy to adjust and are very smooth, line goes on very evenly and auto bail is very convenient. even in small sizes these reels will handle large fish. In fact, if you need a travel kit, but a good reel in a versitile size and buy the telelscoping rod seperately - the cheap reels often included i these packages are not satisfactory - I had one in which the drag burned out after I caught a few good bass.	20
I have not seen these toons in a while. The last time I watched these toons on cable, they were hacked up and censored, mainly due to the racist humor in them. For example in 'Magical Maestro' an ink pen is squirted onto Poochini and transformed in a &quot;black faced&quot; performer. Well I was glad to see the cartoons on this tape were not touched by the censors, and everything is in tact!This is a must for any Tex Avery fan, I plan on purchasing the next volumes in this series.I would loved to have seen it on DVD :) (hint hint)	6
"I typically useOrtho 0196010 Home Defense MAX Perimeter Granules - 2.5 lb.to work around the perimeter of my house.  The granules are easy to apply and use and they really seem to work.I decided to try Safer Brand Powder Bug killer and applied it as directed.  This is a powder and it is best applied to ant hills and as directed provided there is not the lightest bit of breeze.  It will blow around like talc and that isn't fun since despite it being called ""Safer"" it is hazardous too.This did not work for us.  I find the perimeter granules more effective."	18
I went ahead and purchased it, thinking i'd be getting tanned color. For some reason, i have this way of thinking buff= dark/tan color... Turns out it was not even close. I normally wear barely there, and this one was very creamy. Although this isnt something i would wear on a normal basis, it did go really well with my black skirt w/ white feathery sweater top. I wouldn't dare wearing it with any other though, just not my color; Too bright. It was a nice try though.	8
This is one of the best books I've read in years.  It had excellent character development and I had to keep reminding myself that it was fiction.  Since hearing about the dreadful Hartford circus fire from my mother (who had friends perish), I have always found it to be such an interesting topic.  This bridged the gap from story to reality by referencing some of the real aspects of the circus by utilizing that backdrop with an interesting storyline.  I cannot wait until the next book!	5
I've taken several kinds of prescription medications for my acid reflux, but none of them work as quickly and as well as Pepcid Complete!  Love the mint flavor--the berry is nasty.  I know there was a recall a few years ago because of foreign matter being found in a few jars, but this stuff is still hard to find in our local stores.  Too bad its expensive, but if you have acid reflux and don't want to get stuck taking daily prescription medication, this is the one to use.	12
I really like all of the I Spy products.  I like the beautiful photos, and I like to find the items in the books, too.  Knowing that, we got this game off of an Amazon.com wish list for my daughter's third bithday.  She's still playing with it at four years, but she needs my help to lay out the pieces and play it with her.  I would recommend it, though.  The puzzle pieces are easy to put together, and it is a well made toy.	22
Well, I played 40+ puzzles, I guess it can't be bad. You might almost call it addicting. :-) It is a decent puzzle game, but somehow it feels a bit overdone. Can a game be too flashy or frilly?Regardless, this game will keep you occupied. I haven't played any of the other traffic puzzle games to give an accurate comparison. But, if you like puzzles or puzzle games you won't be disappointed getting this one as Free App of the Day. Whether it's worth paying for compared to the free alternatives, I can't say.	1
This is an excellent organic soap product.  Well worth the money.  Used for hand washing, I find that even a tiny amount leads to lots of sudsing and good cleaning.  Also leaves the skin feeling soft and smooth.  My wife has found it to be  an excellent grease-cutter in the kitchen, and I have started using it in the place of our traditional Dawn dishwashing detergent for our dishes and pans.  Evenf for greasy pans it doesn't take a large amount, much less than I have to dispense with Dawn.	20
Some things just don't need to change. Some Wah pedals try to tempt you with built in fuzz, eq, or other wacky add-ons but WHY? I'd rather have one pedal that does its job perfectly than a pedal that does a bunch of stuff but sounds less than great. The Crybaby is a great effect to have for any style; everyone from Jack White to Jimmy Hendrix have used some incarnation of this pedal. It's a must have and that's really all there is to say.	16
"My Son is really into ""old school"" music and after visiting Cleveland's Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, he really wanted a movie about Woodstock. I came across this Collector's Edition on Amazon and took a chance. HE LOVES IT! A ticket came inside which he laminated and put up in his dorm. He just loved all the little goodies inside the packaging. The tamborine on top is really sturdy and a nice touch. The footage itself is rich and very well done. The bonus footage includes some of the 'flavor' of the 60's as well. Great gift."	6
I like to use these in my fish tanks to catch debris and food before it gets a chance to hit my main filters. You can cut them to size and one roll lasts years. I use them in the tank on intake hose, food gets caught and the fish still have a chance to eat it, when its dirty I toss it.I also use this inside my filters if I run out of my regular pre filters and need to replace. I cut to size and use till my good filters arrive in the mail.	19
This could be a5-star app except for three issues. First, there's no insurance option for ace up in the dealer's hand. Not that I use it that frequently, but I've never encountered a blackjack program without it.Second, the HUGE ads that pop up too frequently are a great annoyance.Third,  I just discovered that the app will occasionally hit on 17. I believe this is a big no-no.I'm tempted to knock off two stars for this combination of issues, but I will satisfy myself with one for the moment.	1
A lot of the reviews said this stone won't put out as much air as the pictures show, so far, so good for me. A couple notes, though - if you use the pass through connection (you can hook up incoming air to one side, and another tube to another air stone on the other side) you won't get nearly as many air bubbles. So keep that in mind, it seems to pass through a lot of the air through the other tube, sacrificing it's own usefulness. If this is the only stone you'll have, though, perfect!	19
This is a short piece of hose.  It may not be the colour shown, so don't buy it if you're using it for decorative purposes.  If you want it to function, it will.Yes, it has a plastic washer instead of rubber.  If you would happen to have a leaking problem, just add some teflon tape (which you should be doing to all your pressurized hose joints anyway as a precautionary measure) - it only costs a few cents a roll.As this is the cheapest such item to serve its purpose, it gets my recommendation.[Mine is red and green, apparently for Christmas].	18
First of all, I gotta admit: I AM A FOODIE. Give me the appropriate tools and I can follow any recipe and go anywhere.I so admire the &#34;Masters'&#34; and their abilities to be put to the ultimate test against others of their level of excellence. And they pull it off time after time.I SO enjoy watching the professionals going toe-to-toe and feeling what they feel as human beings, each with his/her own foibles and insecurities at the top level of their crafts.	0
This game was very poorly made...it's really boring, because all you do is walk around and throw stuff at things. All the enemies are exactly the same, there's never any health, and 100 health points aren't enough, because the health goes down too fast. The sight of range is ridiculous because half the screen is nothing but fog, and it all just draws in as you walk ahead, making it hard to see enemies. I do like seeing the familiar South Park characters in 3D, the game is very funny, and the weapons are hilarious! But still, I wouldn't buy it. Rent at most.	23
First immediate impression: really sweet and artificial tasting. Though it kind of tastes like fruit punch in my opinion, it's kind of a shocking type of taste for a product like this. Definitely a bit like candy as reviewers have mentioned.Apart for the energy, it did keep me going for a game of basketball I had about an hour after eating the bar. Nutrition facts aren't that great compared to completing products, however. And like other products from this manufacturer, they're still quite expensive per single bar.	12
This game was a very fun game. You basicly go to a castle and you jump into a paintings.. each one leading you into a different world... and in every world... you have to find 7 stars... (one of em is the 100 coin star where you need to collect 100 coins then it pops up it's the hardest star to get)there's 16 worlds in all... most worlds take hours to complete so this game well be well worth it.. This game right here is history... It's one of Nintendo's biggest hits... and when you buy this game you'll soon find out why:)	23
Cetaphil Gentle Skin Cleanser is the gentlest facial cleanser I have been able to find.  I am highly allergic to several different soaps and preservatives, but Cetaphil doesn't cause me to break out, itch, or dry up.I'd suggest the liquid Cetaphil cleanser instead of their soap bar, as bars can cause one to have clogged pours (read: blackheads).The only downside is that it won't remove makeup very easily, so I only use it in the morning and use my trusty cold cream at night.This 4 oz side is perfect to throw in your gym bag or overnight suitcase.	4
"i am most likely to play this record after watching mtv promote ashley simpson for the fiftieth time. in a rage, i blast it in my car and scream ""yea steve!"" real loud. i only listen to ""power of independent trucking"", ""l dopa"", ""colombian necktie"", ""ergot"", ""fish fry"", and ""pavement saw"" because they are clearly the best. in an effort to become more hardcore, i then go eat some battery acid. then some motor oil. then some aids."	9
I have been using this product for almost a year now and as with all Eucerin products it is the best. There are products on the market that are selling for 5 times what this cost and this is every bit as good. I'm 70 years old and look 10 to 20 years younger. This product makes my facial skin soft and moist looking. The first few times I applied it I could feel my skin tightening particularly around the eyes. I use about a jar a month as I apply it morning and evening.	4
I keep these in a shelf on my desk for an easy hot lunch at work. Following the package directions always turns out right for me. (add water, heat for four minutes)Actually a decent amount of broccoli, but you could make it healthier by adding even more. I know it's a convenience food, but even so, I find it a bit too salty. I'm always thirsty after eating it. But, it's yummy and my other coworkers always ask what I've made because it smells good, too.	11
Honestly, I wasn't expecting much from the price...but we all surprised by how cool it turned out to be.  This was a Xmas gift to my husband and my intent was something the family could enjoy and that is exactly what I got.  The kids get all excited when he pulls it out and he's gotten pretty good at the flying aspect that he can Chase people around with it.  We haven't taken it outside, but really this was a great buy and we have gotten more than our moneys worth.	22
This is my families first experience with a game like this and we love it!  We had so much fun playing together and how refreshing not to play a game with money. This game is high quality and focuses on points. This game is not overly complicated like others we have attempted to play and takes about an hour for players of 3-4. I love that there is a little bit of strategy and people can block off you routes if they catch on to where you are headed. This will be a family favorite!	22
"I read this book from cover to cover, and I'm glad I did.  But I thought it was very sad, because of the old man in the nursing home narrating the book, because of the animal abuse to the elephant and other species, and because of the spousal abuse to the elephant rider.  Oh, there were elements of humor, friendship, love, and happiness.  The ending was good as well as unexpected.  Still, if I had to describe this book in just one word, it would be ""sad."""	5
This season was awesome.  If the DVD release is anything like the previous 2 it will be an awesome set.  The only thing I am upset with is the fact that there were only 16 parts of this season.  Petty, yeah, but hey, I can be petty.  The acting, writing, and episodes are pretty spot on.  As for Bella, I really dont think she will be in season 4.  Well, unless she can crawl.  All in all, a great show, great acting, great writing, just was missing to much for me to be totally happy.  I wanted more, not less!!!	0
I  have  bought  Jockey  before  and  they  were  quite  good  but  these  seem  already  stretched  to  the  max  Before  putting  them  on ,  very  little  give  left  in  the  bands .I  don't  know  if  it's  a  cheap  knock  off  with  a  bogus  Jockey  label  or  if  Jockey  is  now  cutting  corners  but  I  wouldn't  buy  them  sight  unseen  again .Probably  back  to  brick &  mortar  for  Jockey  purchases  ( see  what  it  is  Before  I  get  it ) .	8
I ordered this some time ago. I finally started using it last week. It was very difficult to figure out how to use. But, once I ready the instructions a few times I got it.  My 8 month old loves all electric cords. I needed something to protect her. For the past week this has been working.Only one side of it can I get a big 3 prong plug into it. I only need 2 openings to get in and out of so it hasn't presented itself as a major problem yet. I would purchase another one of these.	3
This product is great for about 1-2 years. Over time, the motor will get bits and pieces of your pets' fur and food, which causes the motor to break down, even with regular cleaning. I found no way to purchase a replacement motor, so I was really bummed (as were my cats!).I ended up purchasing a new fountain, but upgraded to theDrinkwell Platinum Pet Fountain. I highly recommend that fountain because it has a small guard that blocks food, fur, and other particles from getting into the motor and its' reservoir.	19
"It worked great for one season but when I went to start it up for this season it wouldn't start. I did everything the manual and website said to do when I put it away last fall and did everything the manual and website said to start it up this spring, including wasting three of the ""clean out"" cartridges and it still doesn't work. Plan on buying a new one every year if this is the one you choose.  Their tech support does not answer emails and the wait for them to answer the phone is nearly endless.Bottom line: avoid this product."	18
These Battery Tenders are miracle workers I think for low use vehicles, equipment, and toys.  I've at least half-dozen of these guys in use at given times.I've  hard-wired a pigtail in all low-use 12v battery-started equipment including my diesel pickup and keep on charge while not in use - these keep my batteries healthy.  They've also rejuvenated many.I figure amount of pocket change spent for charger vs a dead $ulfated battery is enough motivation to purchase and apply.Comes with two pigtail attachments, one made to hardwire  and another with alligator clips - both have fuses and positive-protected connectors.Kyle	2
The first of these loaded into the VCR and refused to come out. I trashed that VCR. The second one loaded into a more expensive VCR seemed to work fine (6 hrs) but after 4 uses the edge was crinkled and making noise on rewind. Again this my be my old VCR's that I no longer own as I switched to a Magnavox MDR515H DVR and no more tape plus it also burns CD's or 500 GB hard drive! (LinkMagnavox MDR515H 500GB HDD and DVD-R with Digital Tuner	10
&quot;That Girl&quot; starring the fabulous Marlo Thomas was a favorite tv show when I was growing up.  Was thrilled to see it on DVD.  My 12 year old daughter has now become part of the new generation of &quot;That Girl&quot; fans ... she watches the dvd herself &amp; we also watch together, great quality time with a classic show.  She's says it makes her feel good ... me too! Wholesome &amp; charming, everybody loves &quot;That Girl&quot;!  We can't wait for Vol. 2 ... 3 ... 4 ... 5 ...  thanks Anchor Bay!	15
I love everything about this season of Rome1  The introductory scenes of Rome and the catchy music begin the seduction. They photography is beautiful.  OMG the story line is at once familiar but new.  The characters are completely fascinating.  The story takes place as the Roman Empire begins to breakdown due to power struggles, civil war, etc.  The shows the aristocrates and the common people as they live through, react to, and adjust to the rapidly changing political climate.  Fascinating!!!!!	0
I wish I had seen previous reviewer's post about Woodcraft before I bought this one.  After spending an afternoon trying to rig various fittings to this thing I finally decided, no, I'm not going to have another duct tape covered Rube Goldberg eyesore in my shop.  And so now, after paying $9.00 shipping to get it here and $17.00 to send it back, I purchased the Woodcraft product and paid whatever it is they charge for shipping only to discover that the same item is now offered on Amazon with free shipping.  Color me pissed.	21
Granted, it is the industrial ingredient standard, but What Suave has done for the knockoff is what Armani has done for the couture industry. Suave Daily Clarifying Shampoo (comes in clear-Blue or clear-White)washes away the daily grime of product use and can also be used to treat swimmer's hair in a pinch. For just under $2.00 it is a real gem, and if I wasn't such a die-hard Aubrey Organics fan, I'd use it every shampoo... Like I said, it's a real keeper (and great for all hair types) !  A+/A-	4
As a beginner guitarist, a few friends let me try out their picks.  I was displeased with most of the standard picks, partially because I didn't like that flimsy feel to them and their sound just didn't sound quite as robust as I like (hopefully, that makes sense).  However, when I was handed one of these, it produced a pleasant sound and I didn't feel like I would somehow break the pick while playing.Needless to say, now that I have my own guitar, I ordered a pack of these and I am certainly not disappointed.	16
I have always felt that OXO is hit and miss with quality.  I have tried several of their kitchen brushes over the years and this one is pretty good.  It has a strong handle and I suspect it will last more than 6 months.  At the same time, I'll probably replace it before then for cleanliness purposes, since the head isn't replaceable.  Regardless, it's cheap and does the trick.  Good for general cleaning of dishes, etc, but not for the true elbow grease stuff.	13
First, this is kind of cheap-looking, but I did try to buy the cheapest OEM car charger I could for my phone, so that's forgiveable.  The springs on the side don't have much force, though, so this is constantly slipping out of the 12V car port.  The cable is sturdy, but the rubber near the connector is kind of stiff, which makes charging AND operating your phone on the go a bit of a hassle.  It's held up well since I purchased it though.UPDATE:  Stopped charging after a month.	7
"I have to admit I was a bit skeptical of this book. ""A book about a circus? How good could that really be?"" I thought. It took awhile for me to get into it too. It wasn't that the beginning was boring or anything, it just took me a little while to get into the plot of the story. After I did though, I couldn't put it down. I lost sleep over the need to finish this book. Some parts I found surprisingly funny. It was an overall, all around good book."	5
"If you're even a lukewarm fan of Brandy, Monica, Mya, Nivea, Ashanti, Britney Spears, Mandy Moore, Jessica Simpson, Teirra Marie, Lumidee (did I miss any of the clones?), give THIS Aaliyah debut a good listen ...All of the aforementioned basically tried to come out behind a very distinctive path carved out by the GREAT Aaliyah: a true entertainer who combined dance, a girl power-esque image via assertiveness (she called it ""street but sweet"") and was the first to dare to put cool, smooth vocals over a blazing hip hop beat.Aaliyah was indeed one in a million ...Highly recommended LP."	9
My Twilight-obsessed teenage daughter and her friends played this game several times.They enjoyed the trivia questions, but preferred to dispense with the game board. They were more interested in the clips and outdoing each other with their vast Twilight knowledge than the details of the board game itself. They especially enjoyed the fact that all three movies released to date were included in this edition.That being said, it is a great sleepover game for teenage girls who are in to Twilight (aren't they all)? If you're looking for a great tween gift or planning a party or sleepover, this is a good choice.	22
Used this in my car.  While it was working, it was great.  Nice big blue light to let you know it's plugged in.  Some of the other chargers have tiny lights that are only visible from one side.  this big transparent power indicator light can be seen from both sides.The design of the charger is great.  It's just WAY too fragile.  The plug had issues 5 weeks after I got it, so now I'm looking for another one (but obviously, not a Motorola).I'm disappointed, I thought a Motorola product would last longer.	7
"I have two bichon dogs ages 7 and 5.  My five year old has clicking joints and I thought I'd try these.  So far they're still clicking but both dogs LOVE these treats. I think I'll have to get joint food as well as the treats.  Treats worked before alone.  For the price and how the dogs like these I plan on reordering them.  I break them in half most of the time since they are nice size even with the ""small"" size."	19
I bought this instead of the moisturizer by mistake, and thought I'd give it a try.It works better than most other cleansers I've tried for my more mature, slightly acne prone, sensitive skin. It's gentle, but effective and my skin feels really smooth and great after I use it. I've noticed that it seems to make the Alpha Hydrox Moisturizer more effective. Definitely a plus. The size of the container is ample, and I use about a quarter's worth for my whole face and decolletage, so it will go a long way.	4
I stumbled upon this app and I just had to try it! I'm like obsessed with these ghost paranormal things! I got it and after two days I got it these words popped up on the screen like, &quot;these&quot; &quot;leaf&quot; &quot;happened&quot; and &quot;vapor&quot; I was not sure what it meant cuz it didn't make sense and after the word vapor appeared I heard this loud crash from my storm door!  CREEPY!  If u r really interested in paranormal stuff like me u should TOTALLY get this app!	1
Great and stone compacts inside the handle for smaller storage.  I bought this to sharpen my Cold Steel shovel and Trail Hawk while camping.  It's just the right size so you dont cut yourself while sharpening anything like a smaller stone.  It worked perfect,  this stone is better for sharpening items like shovels, axes and machete's than for a knife.  I have always been a fan of the verticle v shaped ceramic sticks for sharpening kinves and although this item would work,  its better for larger blades.	20
"I've already apologized for my miserable luck at keeping fish and other domestic animals alive ...I've admitted I'm no good with pets ...so stop pestering me already.  When this ""fresh whole rabbit"" fad caught on, I asked myself, ""Could this be the solution to my decades-long run of defunct critters?"" And it was. But be warned, I would categorize this little rodent as ""less responsive"" than most pets. It seems to be most obedient with the ""Stay!"" command.Pets with heads are overrated."	11
First the amazon extras aren't on a extra disc,they are on theoffical BR bonus disc,and they are super .In fact the bonus footagelooks better than the footage in the Directors Cut ,which even thoughsounds fantastic and looks the best it ever did,Looks grainy and lesscolorful compared with bonus songsAlso they seem to not included most of the Footage from the WoodstockDiaries anywhere on the set,so you don't have footage of a lotof stuff like more CSNY ,Sly,John Sebastion,Airplane ect or anyfootage of the Band.	6
I bought this for my mom who loves the color. She wants me to get a couple more because she's wants backups.I tried it several times and I would say the formula is VERY good for a lipstick at this price point. It doesn't last amazingly long and isn't as AMAZING as some of the more expensive lipsticks I own (Estee Lauder, Mac). But the difference in price is HUGE. And if you're okay with several touch ups in the day, it makes a good every day lipstick.	4
A very-well documented history of the Beatles first trip to the US! Surprisingly, the video and audio are very good for being over 35 years old. Although I'm not a fan of MPI Home Video's quality from what I've seen  so far, this is one of the better ones (although they didn't Q/A the trivia  game). Beatles fans need this -- and so do all fans of music history --  'cuz this is it: almost an hour and a half of the real-life Beatles, their  humor, their charm, and their wonderful music.	6
Dario Argento's Tenebre is very entertaining.  There is one sequence in particular that sticks in your mind, (which I'm not going to discuss, because if you've never seen this film, you're in for a treat).  The ending alone is a huge surprise.  If your an Argento fan or even if you have never seen one of his films.  Then, this is a sure fire bet, although perhaps not his best it is sure to please.The DVD is uncut, and is one of the few films in The Dario Argento DVD collection that comes with a commentary.	15
"the animation in this production is outstanding. you just can't compare todays computer enhanced art graphics with the real thing -  God gifted artists using their intellect and talent and disipline to create thought provoking master pieces such as this. the beautiful back-drops in the film only add to this classic disney story, filled with all of the usual components that make disneys cachet of the animation market of this vein so successful : a morality story of some sort for young and old alike , lots of snappy characters and music, and lots and lots and lots of ""crayons"" !"	6
Not sure what this stuff is or why it works, but it does. I had a 1986 Honda Shadow that had a hard time starting up, and it would randomly choke out and die sometimes. Mechanic said I might need a carb job (super expensive, you have to dismantle the bike). I threw in some Seafoam (full can into an empty tank, just before refueling). Bike ran like new. HOW?Lots of other people have given dozens of incredible uses for Seafoam too, so I'm sure it will serve many other purposes as well.	2
I like the ideas.  I like the characters.  But did I mention that it was really long?  I think that if you really studied this book you could create an entire 3 dimensional model of mars.  Mr. Robinson describes nearly every peeble and crevise on the planet as if he spent 16 years there wandering the barren wastes.The bottom line is - clip 200 pages of scenery description out and it would get 4 stars.  I would have never finished this book if I was reading it in book form.  I did it on tape and it took me about 3 weeks.	5
"This decaf really disappointed me, esp. given the other glowing reviews.  It does not appear green, nor does it taste ""green"" (ie: doesn't have that fresh ""grassy"" flavor many describe as found in an authentic Japanese green tea).  Actually, this could be a good paring with seafood, because  I sometimes detect a slight fishiness in the taste.  Yuk.  Stash Decaf Green, the non-organic, non-premium tea, is actually a little better than this one.  What people like is a matter of personal taste, but I won't ever buy this tea again."	11
Again, I am amazed at the versatility of this spinner.  I find that I can keep my salad GREEN and unspoiled for about 3 weeks.  Still very good taste.  Normally, am afraid of these things, because they usually promise more than they give, but believe you will love it.  It even has a brake on it!!  I find gentle pushing of the plunger on top is best.  After reading some other ratings that others had trouble with breakage, I was a bit concerned, but all worries aside.  You will LOVE it!!	13
I love this wallet!  It has a lot of compartments, but somehow it is fairly lightweight.  The red color and design are just gorgeous.  I guess these went on sale just at the right time for me.  It's been a few months now, and the quality is excellent.One little weird comment which some people might find helpful:  the coin purse section is large enough to hold lip moisturizer!  This means if I switch the wallet to another purse, I don't forget the lip moisturizer.	8
I found it more trouble then it is worth. I am using it in the winter so that can be part of my problem but I just do not see much significant time or hassle savings using this. It is similar to any garden hose reel; any tangle or snag still is requires individual attention.A better way to organize, sure. For those who always leave a cord a mess will this help, sure, but it still comes down to the effort of before and after and how you leave the cord out.	21
I've tried the Motorola ones and either I couldn't hear or the person on the other end couldn't hear (usually both).  I bought this based on a recommendation of a Realtor that swore by it, and to be honest, I have only had occasional trouble with it.  It's comfortable to wear, it's easy to hear, the other person hears me.  I wear it most of the day, on project sites, while driving, even at home.  It works as expected and I'm very pleased with the results.  If you need a bluetooth, this is the one.	7
I've bought a couple of these to keep in different places.  The probe is a soft rubber that doesn't hurt in the mouth.  The display is huge and lights up brightly enough to read, but not so brightly that it hurts your eyes in the middle of the night.  It reads temperatures quickly and has matched what my other thermometer read when I've compared results.  The only possible complaint that I have is that the beeping is LOUD - there is no way to sneak this in and out of a kid's mouth without waking them.	12
Originally I bought this in order to stack a modem and a wireless router. However, when I got it I decided to use it in my office to keep small electronics organized.I put a telephone on the top shelf and then a collection of chargers and adapters on the second shelf. The third shelf has earplugs, small cameras, and other electronics. They're now organized and within easy reach.I like the mesh; it looks good in an office and it would have worked well for the modem and router as it would have allowed air flow at the bottom of the units.	17
"""Hearts and Minds"" is a pivotal episode in the series, adding several key elements for future story lines. No spoilers from me, but as the title suggests, the ""Vs"" are working very hard to win the ""Hearts and Minds"" of the humans and seek to capitalize on the activities of the Fifth Column.This episode also shows us a little more of just how inhuman Ana is with the treatment of humans (with on scene that is not for the squeamish) and even her own daughter.Highly recommended!CFH"	0
I have never read anything like this and I loved every page.  Very few books have actually made me gasp in shock.  There is so much about the traveling circus that is appalling yet intriguing at the same time.  And who knows what is fact and fiction?  Gruen blends the two beautifully.  I am now really interested to learn more about this era of the circus.  I read my copy in 3 days and have already loaned it out.  Trust me, this is a good book!  And so different from any story line I've ever read.	5
I eagerly awaited these, as I really enjoyed the series years ago. The series was wonderful, but I was very disappointed in the quality of the DVD's.  Some are black and white, but my black and white copies showed little explosions of green and red.  The sound faded, and was difficult to hear at times.  In one of the episodes the figures glowed with an eerie green.  I am normally very happy with the quality of A&amp;E DVD's, so the poor quality was a surprise.	15
Pamela Ditchoff has written an entertaining romp through some of the Grimm's stories that is just plain enjoyable.  I read this book with nothing more than entertainment in mind, and that's exactly what she delivered.  While Runyon's lispy speech patterns were a little difficult to follow at first, once I got past the first couple episodes they just added to the world.  Elora & Croesus gave great interludes - the pop-culturish references & snark were amusing.All in all, well worth the time and entertainment buck.	14
Just for fun I bought a sample of this from Garry's sample shop.  I was really surprised how much I liked it.  It does have alcohol in it, but it doesn't set your face on fire after a shave.  Just enough burn to wake you up.  It works well to stop any minor weepers you might have, and the scent is classic, old school barbershop.  Not overpowering, just nice.  My wife likes it as well.  For the price, give it a shot.  You will likely be surprised as well.	12
"Woah, does it work!! I had to cut back on the intervals recommended on the directions, just so I could go out and be human.But it SURE cleanses!After cutting back on my own specific dosage, it still worked but I didn't have to ""run out of the office"" several times a day.......It's a good cleanse!! And yes, I DO recommend it for you Amazonians out there -- just try it at home for the first few days to get an idea of what it does for you, as you may have to adjust your dosage too."	12
When you're using something like this, what can you say?  It's a nice design?  Hey, it's a slotted spoon and designed to be a spoon with holes in it.  OK, it scoops food; so what?Well, this just has a darn good feel to it when I'm scooping food.  Best I've had.  It's as simple as that.  Ain't this all that counts?  Well, sure, it's durable.  You can see that.	13
So I bought a pair because I remember having a pair years back that looked really nice and were quite comfortable. This style has back pockets spaced wider apart than I remember - somewhat similar to Wrangler 13MWZ &#34;cowboy pants&#34;.Contrary to popular opinion, Wrangler butts don't always drive them nuts. My girlfriend doesn't like the look so much. I had ditched two pairs of 13MWZ for the same reason.I will keep them because, well, I am too lazy to send them back and they are very comfortable.	8
"Like all Bosch automotive products, this wiper blade is well designed and does its job extraordinarily well. It uses the standard hook attachment method for wiper arms, and fits snugly (installed on my '00 Accord). When researching wiper blades, I found that the newer ""mono"" style of wiper blade do not quite compare to this standard design, as the newer, more bulkier Rain-X style tend to catch the wind and thus skip spaces on the windshield. I found mine on sale at a local Autozone for $13."	2
I've used used this several times (mostly scrambled eggs) and love it. I like the fact I don't have to worry about it rusting if it stays in the water a few days . Ok, so I'm a guy, old, divorced and not into cooking but I found if I spray it with 'Pam' is is very easy to clean but y'all probably already knew that.I have learned, 'Don't skimp on quality' of kitchen utensils, you'll pay more in the end. Not gonna tell you about my cheap 'melted' spatula!Good product. Hope my comments were a help.	13
This fits our crib mattress tightly and keeps our baby from sweating against the vinyl of the crib mattress.  We didn't have a mattress pad with our son and he would wake up soaking wet from sweating against the vinyl of the crib mattress.  The crib sheet alone wasn't enough to keep him from sweating.  This pad is also not too bulky so it doesn't cause a safety concern.  Just make sure the pad fits TIGHTLY on YOUR crib mattress for safety's sake.  We have a Sealy Crown Jewel Mattress and it fits great on it.	3
I don't use this often but when I do it feels great to my skin.  It cleans well, removes oil and dirt.  I like how does not cause that overdrying feeling once it dries.  It also seems to have a cooling aid too so if I happen to clean to harshly I won't tell.  For those who wear makeup from my understanding it's a good at removing it before bedtime.  This does cost a few bucks more than its competition Noxzema -- I don't see a big difference besides you paying for the name.  Nevertheless pretty good facial cleaner.	4
I was initially leary about purchasing this item due to the extremely low price and to have free shipping also, but I needed a wall charger since Motorola only includes a car charger with their wireless car phone speakers.  So I took a chance (due to the low price and free shipping) and was pleasantly surprised.  The charger appears to as well made as the other after market chargers I purchased previously for my e-book reader, PDA, camera, etc., and at less than 25% of the cost.  I charged my Motorola speaker without any problems.	7
We have four dogs and they have done very well with the Holistic Select line.  It's a bit more money but if you look at the ingredient list, you'll see why.  Our dogs have not had digestive issues and their skin and coat are healthy. I am also a happy camper for not having to drag a big, bulky and heavy bag from the store to car to home.  The product is priced right and shipped super fast.  Amazon Prime is so worth it especially if you order a lot of stuff online.	19
Pros:- works better than chamois in absorbing water.- does not produce streaks when drying cars  - Spot free!- I cut it to half and quarter sizes - makes it great for the kitchen tops, sink and bathroom- works great for kitchen spills- available almost everywhere- cheaper than chamoisCons:-You have to store it moist in the canister or it will dry stiff as a cardboard. (Dip it on water and it is good to go again).-Storing it moist promotes growth of bacteria and micro-organism. Forget about using it on your body as a towel or drying your plates, pots and utensils.	2
With the money I saved on my Delta 36-650 table saw, I bought this blade and the matching dampener/stiffener on the recommendation of a friend. I am stunned at the quality of the cuts this blade makes; the finished work looks sanded, and the blade cuts all the materials I've tried so well that it's hard to envision going back to regular carbide-tipped blades. When this blade eventually needs to be sharpened, I will probably buy a second one so I don't have to do without it while it's back at Forrest. It's that good.	21
For the price, this box works just as well as as any expensive one would. Just put in a 9v battery and it works right away. Three knobs to control tone, level and distortion to get that perfect sound. I do recommend you get a power adapter, because this eats us batteries like crazy. I accidentally left it on for a few hours and the juice was all dry, batteries are expensive, get the power supply. Overall, this is a good budget buy, you won't need to money for quality with this.	16
These folders are perfect for small to medium size file jobs.  The fasteners are very sturdy and easy to use -- they aren't the super flimsy fasteners that are easy to crush.  They have a nice weight and strength to them.The folders themselves are nicely colored and a little bit thicker than economy folders.  They have reinforced tabs, which is very nice and adds to their strength.  I would not call them heavy duty folders though, and I am not sure I would use them for any file that would see heavy usage.	17
This is traditional wide-ruled, three-hole paper. Exactly the quality you expect from Mead--decent thickness with clear, crisp lines and edges--and ideal for grade-school to middle-school writers. If wide-ruled notebook paper is what you, or your child, needs, this is as good as, or better than, any other option. With one caveat ... It's the kind of thing best bought on sale, because off-season or single pack purchase can be absurdly pricey: 4 to 5 times the price of the same goods at better times (like back to school events).	17
My razor feels like new again with these, that simple, very smooth and maybe even better than new.You should note that in my case, these heads were actually a slightly varied design on the tops of the heads, the slits/openings on these heads were different than the originals - I'm no engineer, but it seems they've improved the design, while maintaining backward compatibility.Get 'em.UPDATE:  At this point about 15 months later, heads are still ok, but do occasionally PULL on the hairs if it starts getting full, probably will replace these soon.	12
Movie, actors, scenery, sequences were excellent.While acknowledging it wasn't designed as a &#34;Prime Time&#34; series (sorry for the pun),  I grew very tired of the constant use of that ubiquitous &#34;F&#34; word.  History has recorded the crudeness of their vernacular, so the screaming reminders, tailored no doubt in reference to our own evolving society,  added little historical authentication or credibility.  In fact, I found it quite contradictory as most conversations were so grammatically proper.	0
"If you're a fan of the award-winning book, then I predict you'll enjoy this movie as well. The animation is lovely, the music is superb, and the characters are simply delightful.This movie is very innocent and genuine, something that you don't see very much of these days; with all these R-rated movies packed with violence and vulgarity and sexuality and heaven knows what else. ""Charlotte's Web"" has none of that. It is nothing but pure gentility and pure fun for the whole family. I absolutely love it, and I'm definitely looking forward to the release of the live-action version."	6
I had bought this sheet on the recommendation of others from Babies R Us.  The snaps make it a breeze to change, I'm so glad I don't have to take the mattress out of the crib all the time!  The waterproof backing is great not just for the diaper leaks but also for the spit-ups.  The only reason I'm giving it 4 stars instead of 5 is because the snaps don't fit exactly around my crib rungs so it's a little wrinkled and off center, but my baby doesn't seem to mind.	3
Had it for a week, does what it says it does, but make absolutely sure the clips don't touch anything when it's attached. Positive alligator clip got close to inner hood liner and burned. Flamed up. Burnt the red plastic boot off and if i didn't blow the liner out (I freaked!), my vehicle would have gone poof! Pilot error? Bad design? Who knows.Edit: Just called Schumacher and they're replacing it, no problem. Upping my rating from a ** to ***. Thanks Schumacher.	2
This item links up easily.  Dont make the mistake I did of trying to pair it each time...you dont have to once you have paired it once.  this transmits a true 30 feet.  I'm driving to key west next week and will know how long a charge lasts after that.  Nice to finally be able to use my wireless bluetooth stereo headset on any of my sound players..Update:  This stopped working after a year...the on/off button is unresponsive now.  It was great while it lasted!!!	7
Works well even in the wind.  Can't listen to music through it with my SLVR though, as expected.  I find I don't use it much though.I set up a shortcut in my SLVR for quickly enabling bluetooth when I am wearing my headset. If I have a bluetooth headset active, it refuses to play music at all - through the built-in speaker or a cable.  But this is the fault of the SLVR.Update:  I dropped it outside, where it got rained on for two days before I found it.  Thoroughly dried it out and turned it on.  Still works!	7
Been using this for years. A little goes a long way, and it gets you clean and minty. Makes your eyelids and, um, some other parts, tingle like mad, to the point of being nearly annoying, but it is a transient sensation. Don't get this stuff in your eyes while wearing contacts, burns like hell. But that is true of many soaps.  I use this stuff for both soap and shampoo, it is gentle enough for that, at least for a (non-metro) guy.	20
"I have used this product for years and would be lost without it.  It not only works for any and all recipes that call for chicken stock, but it is also great for adding chicken flavor to things like mashed potatoes, rice, etc.  It is very handy for the ""flu"" season when you just want to hunker down with a cup of chicken soup.  For those times, I make a cup of chicken broth using this product.  Sometimes, I add leftovers from the fridge... rice, vegies, chicken.  The other flavors are also very handy... adding distinct flavors to your cooking repertoire."	11
Not the &#34;Ohhhhhh noooooooo!&#34; again! This toy gets to be very annoying because that's all it says but it's fun to see the look on the dog's face when Mr. Bill says it. This toy is not for destructive breeds or if the dog doesn't use the soft mouth. The box inside breaks if dog chews on it alone. It has stuffing in it but if you want and know how to, you just sew it back up. It's a fun toy but easy to break. This was the 3rd toy I've bought for the dog. She likes the &#34;Ohhhh noooo!!!&#34;	19
DYMO brand labels are more expensive than generic labels. A lot more expensive sometimes. However, I burned through 2 DYMO label printers with inferior generic brand labels. They got the machine jammed up and caused the entire machine to burn out and fail. Generic labels caused me a big headache and lost money and time. I still like my DYMO printer, but I learned my lesson the hard way. Spend the extra money on DYMO brand labels. Yes, they are probably charging a little too much, but it is what is. The labels are high quality and won't ruin your printer.	17
I ended up gaining a lot of stress weight just before my wedding, and needed to cinch in so i could lace my dress closed.It is comfortable, and stays in place. Also very breathable.I wore it the whole day.I've worn it since when i needed a bit of extra help getting into dress pants.Been through about 7 washes, and just got a small tear on the inside.Also take note that the garter clips are removable.Goes clear up to almost my bra in the front.Was well worth the money.	8
We brought these nipples based on all the raving reviews and write up's online.  However our newborn is now here and wasn't putting on enough weight.  Our pediatrician told us these are the worse brand of bottles on the market for newborns and shouldn't be used until the baby is at least 5 months old.  The reason for this is because the nipple is too large for a newborn to latch on to and they're unable to get enough.  We are now using the Medela nipples instead and he's feeding so much better.	3
This is a wonderful holster for my Ruger SP101.  It fits perfectly.  Like others have stated though, the thumb snap is difficult to work with the gun in the holster at first.  But once in and snappped, you leave it for a day or so and the leather forms to your gun and the snap begins to work fine.  After that, it's terrific.  The only thing I wish for it is an adjustable cant.  But I knew it didn't have one before I ordered so won't dock stars for that.	20
This is in no way a Giant cat litter pan, lol. I ordered it based on the description that it was larger than large-that it was giant. I have a cat on the larger side and thought this would be bigger than the large pans found in pet stores.It's not.I ordered a large cat litter pan from amazon for $5.99 that is larger than this one.The pan is of nice quality though. I think it would be perfect for a medium sized kitty.I'll be returning this. False advertising is a pet peeve.	19
7 months and this baby is ready for the trash.  I could accept that from the $1.99 camping can opener.  But I'm not gonna pay $12.00 for this thing to rust out in half a year.Problem being the rust builds up on the shaft of the turning gear and slowly works its way through to the divet.  We have never put this thing into the washing machine.  Very disappointing.As an emergency replacement we got the no name can opener from the grocery store.  Cheap, clean, works well.	13
I sprayed this on my yard, not to protect any of my greenery but to stop the squirrels from climbing up the wall and into the gutters and roof. So far, I can't tell if its the rain or the Havahart spray that stopped the squirrels but so far I haven't seen any squirrels running around in the general area. This leads me to believe its the rain that is shooing the squirrels away. I will save the rest of the Deer Off when spring time arrives or when the squirrels come back around.	18
Of all the various brands of bluetooth headsets I've purchased, all of the Plantronics products seem to offer the best value for the dollar.  I have purchased other headsets from Sennheiser, BlueAnt, Trek, Jawbone, Pioneer, Sony, Motorola, and god knows who else. Plantronics has been the ONLY brand that I've been a repeat customer of.  I've gotten the same sound quality out of this $20something headset as I did from the $140+ Jawbone and $160+ Sennheiser!  My advice, simple, order this or any Plantronics headset, take the change and get some new games or apps on that fancy Android handset...	7
I never would have thought I would enjoy a show like this. WOW...what a show. Honestly, I could do without the foul language and the nudity and in most cases such would cause me to go elsewhere. But this show is one of the BEST crime drama's I've ever seen. The main character, Dexter Morgan, is one of the BEST lead characters ever. The supporting cast of characters (everyone from his sister to girlfriend(s) to the many police officers) are all excellent as well. But wow...the story is soo good! It just pulls you in and keeps you wanting more.	0
I have used the EXL115W set for years.  Nice to have the whole set again.  Sometimes have to buy the EXL115 without the wound third, and then have to find the wound third in a single string.  Not fun.  I like the sound of the wound third.  I play a thin hollow-body electric and love how the strings sound and are easy on the fingers.  No more thick calouses on the fingers.  Playing weekinds and practicing, they last a long time with the same sound quality.	16
"i remember this movie as a teenage girl of fourteen, and i enjoyed it then as i enjoy it now as an adult, i was so happy to see that it was on dvd, so i purchased it with ""roller boogie"", also a classic during the 70s theme times. it was in good quality and still pretty funny, and seeing jeff goldblum so young, was funny to see. all in all a good buy. if you like the music the cd is a good buy with the movie."	15
I use to pay for a TV Guide Magazine subscription until I found this app. This little app is excellent for those who just want to know what your listings are. It's easy to use. You can look ahead to see what is coming on later in the day, or the next day.I would give it a 5 star rating if it weren't for the fact that the app can be buggy on occasion. But hey --- it's free and it's so good in so many other ways, I'm not going to complain too much.	1
"History and war buffs, rejoice. Just when you thought you'd seen every World War II documentary, from ""The World At War"" to ""Victory At Sea"", this set appears. While you may not glean a wealth of new information or insight into the period, the color films imbue the war with an immediacy you've never experienced before- unless of course, you were there. This alone makes the DVD a worthwhile investment of time and money. Bear in mind this is all bona-fide color footage-nothing has been colorized. The effect is spellbinding, almost miraculous- as when Judy Garland as Dorothy first lands in Oz."	15
Okay, since most of the printers don't come with cables any longer, you always need to purchase one separately.  A &quot;regular&quot; printer cable can cost around $20 and it can be difficult to plug and unplug correctly without breaking one or more of those tiny prongs.  So a USB cable is a great solution.  It costs less and it's easy to plug and unplug, especially if your computer has front-mounted USB ports.  I bought this one for my new HP LaserJet 1012 Printer and it works just fine.  For this price, it's a great bargain.	10
DEMONS is a classic of kill-or-be-killed / monsters-on-the loose cinema. Bava presents us w/ plenty of victims and the demonized hordes who love them! Both humans and demon-possessed creepers are slaughtered in huge numbers! Trapped in the METROPOL theatre, a group of patrons encounter the first wave of a demonic assault.  Watch as the dwindling survivors unite in order to fend off the hideous, slime-drooling hell-spawn! DEMONS is definitely a product of the '80s, w/ it's goofy fashions and silly hairstyles, which makes the death scenes all the more rewarding and fun to watch! Recommended for all fans of slobbering excess (like me)...	15
One of my summer projects was to file, re-file, and re-organize existing files. Not the most pleasant task in the world. One of the things I wanted to avoid this time around was my messy hand written tab titles for the hanging folders.Voila!These Avery computer generated tab title thing-a-me-bobs are exactly what was needed! Download the template, type the titles, print out and attach- couldn't be easier.I love it when simple products perform their designated task well and make my life just a little bit easier.	17
Good: My 3 year old loves it.  It was fun, interactive, and she got the concept quickly.  Graphics are cool, as are the sticker rewards.Bad: It does get repetitive at times, so a few more challenges or variety would be nice.  Also, it turns off your screen saver as well as your ability to exit the app, so the only way to stop it is to turn off the phone, turn the phone back on, and then kill it, so it's murder on your battery life.	1
Just the right age group it was made for. My son is 2 and loves learning about the colors and numbers at the same time. I love that it has puzzle fruit, counting how many fruits go into the lunchbox, plus he's learning his small to biggest, and even his color groups. May not be a lot to some people, but it makes a little difference to a little person that loves learning everyday. I love this game for him and I have seen that he is learning a lot everyday.	1
"It's my first CD bought from Amazon and it's one of the best albums of Patti. Different styles but a unique big voice! Hear her Aretha's voice in the track 5, for example! Track 1 is a new version of the first song in her album ""Havana Candy"".  Track 2 shows us her ""Ability To Swing"". Tracks 3-4-10 are beautiful ballads. Track 6 is the reggae one. Tracks 7-8 have a sweet sound. Track 9 is my favourite of the album, in a gospel style."	9
When it comes to a fuel filter, this is the best. Only filter that fits perfectly. Makes the job very easy. If your not sure, try another brand. It will work, but the secondary clips won't fit. It will be ok,  but not 100% perfect. Just get the right one, the Motorcraft. I am a certified Ford mechanic in Michigan and did hundreds of these. Don't fret over an extra couple dollars. This is the only fuel filter that goes on easy, and is the best for your Ford vechicle.  Like i say, try another brand and see for yourself. Bye!	2
the game was awesome. Zelda has always been an addicting, mindblowing, and fun game. Many people like it. The game features a great 3d world in which there is night and day. the game also has many different enemies and dungeons and the famous ocarina where you can play different tunes that you have learned. A really good game if you like action and adventure. The frustrating thing are the puzzles. they may take some time to solve. This is not why i gave the game 4 stars. I believe 5 stars means the game is perfect. and this game is not perfect.	23
I am a college student and found that I tend to do much better in my classes if I at least make an attempt to read the book.I bought these because of the price, but was very happy with them. I used Bic highlighters last semester.  They worked okay, but during finals when I was highlighting like crazy, they would die.  I bought another set, and they too, ended up in the trash.These have yet to die on me.I have a variety of colors because I tend to color code my textbooks.  For me, it makes studying much easier.	17
I bought a bunch of these bottles because many people have recommended them to me.  My son HATES them.. the nipples are too hard for him and it takes him forever to get anything from them..  He wears himself out sucking on them.  I finally switched to the gerber comfort hold bottles which he loves.  They are similar but have softer nipples.  My son is no longer cranky from not getting enough formula. I know alot of people love them, but my son doesnt.  I never had a problem with leaks however as some people said.	3
I ordered the 40in. (sm) GunMate Deluxe Rifle case for a Ruger 10/22 carbine.It was a PERFECT fit for the 10/22 with a 3-9X40 scope. My scope is mounted with UTG medium height quick disconnect rings.When I say perfect fit I mean that if my scope rings were higher or a had a hi rise picatinny rail it would have not fit.Yes it is a &#34;lockable&#34; case keeping in mind that it is vinyl and rather easily opened with a razor blade.Zipper appears adequate and strong enough along with plenty of padding without being bulky.	20
"Wow, what a pile of trash this show turned out to be... I guess obnoxious, sexist, chauvinist, offensive, disgusting, neanderthal humor is not my cup of tea, I would call this a guttural deeply embedded teenage boy fantasy goop comedy wannabe. I regret even watching the single episode of this trash. If you like this kind of show, have fun, but be warned it reaches way under the gutter of impropriety for its kicks... you've been warned. The series is rated ""M"" for mature of audiences... what demographic are these folks pushing for? Definitely not ""Mature"" that's for sure."	0
Booooo yeah!Best game I've played!  If you like action adventure, this is the best game for it.  It is sooooo cool, the movies are pretty cool also, weapon, a monster, IT LOOKS AWSOME!!!!!!!  This game is totally the best, best graphics, it is just too cool.  No blood so parents, no fear for children, just violence.  I recomend this game to EVERYONE!  No need to rent, buy it while you still can!  I can't for one, to good of a game I guess.	23
Our Apollo can't live without his Teddy! I've never had a dog so attached to his toy. He mangles it,runs with it and sleeps with it. Absolutely in love with it. It has held up better than any of his other toys...I just wish Amazon would bring back the large version of this toy. I bought 2 mediums in case his beloved large fails. This dog toy is the best and has taken 2 years of 95 lb. black Lab punishment...now that is a true test!!	19
It's a fun little game but way too short.  You go from room to room exploring the mansion.  Most rooms have objects/tools to collect such as keys, matches, a wrench, an ice pick, etc...  Some rooms are locked as are some chests, cabinets, etc...  You use the objects/tools you find to gain access to new parts of the mansion, get access to other objects and tools, and solve puzzles that allow you to progress further into the game.  Great game but really, really short.  HTC EVO 4G.	1
"I have used this kind of boxes in moving many times. One thing I like about it is that you can flatten it once you are done with the move. It is also very easy to fold and stack up. One special feature I don't see in other brands is this ""locking life-off lids"". It is less likely to lift open accidentally. It comes with different strength. This one is medium duty, which is quite versatile. You just have to remember that you don't load it with only those hard cover books. I need to use extra-duty boxes for them."	17
This waist cincher is perfect to accentuate an hourglass shape. The inner-contour bands in the middle help create a fierce silhouette. I regularly wear steel-boned corsets, and find this to be a great summer alternative. For comfort, I suggest wearing a corset liner underneath if you wear for an extended period of time. Next time I order, I will size down as it is not snug enough for my taste. Remember to buy cincher by waist measurement. Pair with a bullet bra for an extreme look that is bound to turn heads.	8
Look, it's a plastic box that's just 5.5&#34; square and 2.5&#34; deep, with a cheap three-inch speaker inside. It produces decent sound, although there's substantial background hiss and it has a nasty habit of picking up digital &#34;static&#34; from my computer. It's OK as a practice amp, but I certainly wouldn't want to perform with it. In short, it's only a small step above toy level, which is what you'd expect for a twenty-dollar amp. That doesn't mean it's not useful, but you need to be realistic about what you're getting here.	16
This product didn't say whether it could or could not be used on the face, however, I chose to use it on the face because the active ingredient was Glycolic-AHA. It broke me out on the forehead and scattered acne on my cheeks and jawline. I recommend acne.org's AHA lotion. I've been using ACNE.ORG's skin line for a year and they have an AHA lotion along with acne care and it works amazingly. I actually had to go back to it and it cleared my acne up again.	4
Give it 2-3weeks and I gaurentee you will be glad you tried it, it is light and thirst quenching on the skin and seems to cover a multitued of tasks, you will not need seperate creams for eyes etc. My tip is to use it a s a night and day cream after gentle washing and exfoliaiting the face. By night put slighty too much on so as the skin has to slowly drink it in.You really will see a plumpness and radiance to your face in this space of time. This stuff is not bank breakingly expensive either.	4
You can use this product to cut a high quality screen protector for anything with a touchscreen. That's awesome. Keep in mind that you have to cut and apply the screen protector yourself. It took me a few applications before I got good at it. Some air bubbles are normal, they dissipate after a few days. Lots of air bubbles means you are doing it wrong. Practice makes perfect.  You get 10 screen protectors for about $10.00 (or whatever they are selling it for) and the sheets they give you are pretty large. I think this is product is a very good value.	7
The bulldog gets it done.  I can't say enough about this tool.  Its done everything I've asked it to do. From hammering through a 8 in slab, to drilling through  8 in block.Of course, I don't use it everyday like a contractor, but I'de imagine for that kind of use, I'de buy one of the bigger bosch hammers for everyday punishment.  The bits are somewhat pricey, but for good reason, they last!  You will only probably need to buy them once.For occasional to medium use,  this is a winner!	21
THE BEST N64 GAME. It's easy, difficult to totally master, and is fun to play again and again. The bosses are creative and original, and the dungeons are fun and easy. Storyline is pretty good, better than the &quot;save the princess&quot; generalization it's often given. The characters are a quiet hero of time, an eternally youthful forest girl, a wild rock man from the firey Death Mountain, a rebellious fish woman, a determined royal guard, a sexy thief, the &quot;princess&quot;, and of coure, Ganon the bad guy.	23
I cooked a Turkey on my Charcoal Rotisserie for Thanksgiving 2010. I used the Pecan Wood Chips according to the instructions on the bag, and WOW!!! They put a taste into that Turkey that is hard to describe!!  It was so delicious and jucy. I always wondered what Pecan Wood smoke would do to meat, and now I know. No turning back now. I must try some Ribs with these chips next, and a Roasting Chicken.....mmmmmmmmm!!  Highly recommended. Will purchase again.	18
As a person who usually reads non-fiction books about science and psychology, I thought I'd give myself a break and see what all the hype surrounding Water for Elephants was about. I was not disappointed. It was not the best book I've ever read, but it was very entertaining and a pretty quick read. I was explaining to someone that the story is very formulaic: guy wants girl, can't have girl, ends up getting girl - but it was set against a different backdrop than others. Sometimes that's exactly the kind of book you want to read.	5
I've used this for around a year now, absolutely love it.  I keep getting more gardening tools and haven't ran out of pockets yet.  The pockets are all different sizes, some very narrow for something like a pair of scissors or a marker, there is a big one that fits my PH tester perfectly.  I also have theCustom LeatherCraft 1140 EasySeat Lightweight Plastic Bucket Seat for 3 1/2- 5 Gallon Bucketswhich turns the bucket into a chair and seals the interior if you want a dry spider-free place for gardening gloves.	18
"Reading some of the lame negative reviews on ""free app"" day, I almost didn't d'load it. I'm glad I gave it a try anyway. Can't figure out why anyone would rank this low, unless it just didn't work on their tablet or phone. Works great on Kindle Fire. Sort of difficult to put down, once I start playing the puzzles. Both in our family have enjoyed it already. I think this game is better on a tablet than paying 20 bucks for the plastic pieces and game cards for the board game."	1
I don't use the drain feature, so that doesn't bother me (other people have said it's hard to drain.) I love that it's roomy and has a couple different options for seating. I lay my kiddo down to bathe him but allow him to sit up to play. Actually, he can switch himself between the different seating options now (he's 8 months), which worries me a little, that he's that mobile in the tub, but hey, I'm right there watching, so I guess it doesn't matter much, and it entertains him to move around and chase toys around the tub.	3
I felt the book was a little slow getting started, and I had just started to get into the story when it was over.  It didn't have a strong hero that I could get behind and root for, and this made it difficult to lose myself in the story, since I didn't really care what happened to them.  It was also very short and had no resolution.  Presumably this will be resolved later, as there are at least 5 parts to this story.  Since I already 'bought' the next installments, I'll keep going, and I hope it will resolve.	14
Bought this six years ago to use instead of the under-cabinet one that was already installed in my kitchen. The under-cabinet one was better at unscrewing a lid, but occasionally the jar would slip out of the vice and my hand would get pinched.  Well, this OXO opener proved to be a disaster in every way. Like other reviewers noted, it doesn't secure well enough to the lid, slips off the lid, and hurts your hand when it gets slammed into the jar. I'm surprised no one has sued the company for manufacturing this awkward, uncomfortable, dangerous product.	13
Here in Heber Springs we have many deer roaming through the town. I have a problem keeping them from munching on my bushes and stripping the bark from my trees. Other than that, I love to see them wandering around. I have tried other products that keep the deer off of my plants and shrubs, they work, but my poor hands pay the price after applying them. When I saw this product with the battery powered spray, I had to have it. It works and my hands no longer suffer. What's not to love?	18
This blow dryer is a little on the heavy side, and the sound isn't exactly quiet either. BUT, like most people said, I do feel a difference in the way my hair looks and feels when I use this one compared to other regular dryers. My hair tends to be dry to begin with, so maybe that's why i notice the change. But if you already have smooth hair, I wouldn't know how the product performs. Another plus is that it dries my hair quickly...takes about 1/2 the time I usually need.	4
This show was absolutely fantastic - sharp, sarcastic, and funny. It mocked the absurdities of the office culture, employers' complete disregard of the well-being of employees, and a vast gap between the management and the 'drones.' I am mystified why it was cancelled after only two seasons, but am also glad that I did not get to see its decline - which reminds me of 'Common Law' - another great but prematurely cancelled comedy show. I'm happy to own it ; I re-watched some episodes many times. Oh, and those Veridian Dynamics 'ads' are a strike of pure genius!	0
Works as advertised.  It's a tacky pad that is non-adhesive and keeps stuff from sliding around on the dashboard.  Problem with the iPhone (4S) is that the back is a flat panel of Gorilla Glass and does not lift easily off the Sticky Pad.  Instead, it tends to lift the Sticky Pad off the dashboard by sticking itself to the back of the iPhone.  I'm sure the problem would be solved by using an iPhone cover, but then if I did I wouldn't need the Sticky Pad at all.	7
"One reviewer said this, ""If you're tired of pencil erasers going 'stale,' not erasing, smudging, and ripping the paper, then buy these. They work great and last long."" I completely agree.I have pencils with white erasers that go dry, I have a white eraser from a dollar store that looks like these, but it smudges.There may be a rival to these but you can't go wrong with these. I used these on a book with very thin paper, and they did erase the marks thoroughly."	17
With a one year old and two year old around the house, there is no end of messes, spills, leaking diapers,etc. I've used this to clean spoiled milk out of the bottom of our truck, clean up poopie off the carpet, scrub juice off the living room floor and it does a MAGNIFICENT job!! i would buy it a hundred times over. I highly recommend it for small jobs that don't require professional cleaning. It'll definately get you through and do a better than expected job	13
I bought these last fall thinking they'd be great to trim the grass along the walk way. I don't remember using them at all last year; today I pulled them out of the storage space in the garage and discovered the blades refuse to close together.  They stay open about an inch and a half!  There is no way to adjust the closure space so I guess I just paid for a piece of junk. Too bad, the other Fiskar products we have are great. They missed to boat on this one and need to go back to the drawing board.	18
The most interesting part of this compilation was the description before each story of where the author was at time of writing:  headspace, where submitted, frustrations, etc.  Some of the gore seems for gore-sake only.  Have to admit had already read the 8 Jack Daniels novels and new the serial killers from other stories.  I am glad I had read everything else purchased by Konrath, because if I had started with this one, I probably wouldn't have bought anything else.  But he's not writing everything for my group: 55, white female, educated, likes murder/detective/thriller, light or no sex.	14
I don't know why or what I may be doing wrong, but this seems to split the cork when I use it.  It doesn't always, but I'd say half the time I use it the screw goes in straight but goes sideways and breaks the cork when it brings it up.  Then I have to use it again to get the rest of the cork.However it does take the cork out without having to muscle it out.  The cork is not always in one piece, but it's out.	13
use to buy XL t-shirt to fit me properly because I like to wear lose shirt.. so, I thought its the same situation here.. and also I measure 46&#34; as XL (suppose in between 46 to 48.. its my fault I guess). So now I send for alteration at local tailor and now they'll make this XL shirt to L shirt (full alter, sleeves, pocket etc.. etc..) but its ok.. now I learn my lessons about sizing.. :) anyway, i love the design, colour, cloth.. its a very nice shirt.. if only I ordered L size.. Hmmm..	8
My dog trainer recommended this to our obedience class. I found the best price here on Amazon, and my puppy LOVES the treats. Great training treats if used in moderation (too much organ meat isn't good for anyone). Also excellent if you put some of the treats in a container with non-liver treats/cookies. Use the container as a shaker to help train your dog to come, and the other treats get a liver flavored (dust) coating that makes your dog love them even more! No limit on liver dusted treats!Two paws up for this stuff!	19
When you need an audio insert cable, you need an audio insert cable.We custom manufacture insert cables for custom sound-reinforcement fixed installations.  For  mobile rigs, such as mixer cases with processing gear, it's simply not cost effective, and Hosa is our go-to brand for reliability and durability.  There are other brands, but our reputation is at stake.Hosa allows us to maintain our good reputation, while lowering our labor costs. Thanks for such a dependable product, Hosa!  Thanks for such a great price, Amazon!	16
I bought these when I had to re-tube my Marshall JCM800 2203KK head. This is the only tube head I have played or had so I really cant tell you how they compare to other brands but these things rock. They are very good for metal/hard rock and have lasted a year now, while gigging and practicing weekly. I was recommended to JJ by a friend who only uses them and I will likely be doing the same. I paired them with the JJ KT88s and these things just rock.	16
Neat idea- I use mine around the house.  Not sure I would use this in the field though.  I still prefer my toolbox for securing my tools.  The exterior pouches are a little small and not nearly deep enough for most of my serious tools.  I wish Bucket Boss would just have 4-6 large (deep) pockets on the exterior with a few smaller pencil/flashlight slots- they would have a winner then!  Many of the pouches on this are really impracticle to use (in my opinion; electrician/mechanic)	21
I bought this belt for my 2003 Chevy Tahoe with the 5.3L engine and 145A Alternator. Make sure you know which alternator you have BEFORE purchasing this belt. The 105A alternators use a slightly shorter belt. It fits perfectly, doesn't make any noise and works great! You will also need the smallerGoodyear 4040377 Gatorback Poly V-Beltfor the A/C system on these vehicles.My 145 Amp Alternator has a 145A stamped on the side, visible from the drivers side. You could also look for the old belt part number on the existing belt and order accordingly.	2
My family and friends hate this game for some reason, but my girlfriend and I love it and play it together once or twice a week. We love the moral dilemmas involved: whom to let die, Hitler or Reagan? It's a real toss-up (I usually choose Reagan; I feel that he did more damage). I wouldn't bother with the expansions, as they will probably be more of the same, just with a few more cards. One of this type of game in your possesion is enough.	22
This is the best sugar-free maple flavored syrup I've found so far.  I've tried 4 different brands before this.  I read the reviews and decided to give it a shot; although the price is too high here on Amazon.  I've found it 4 bucks cheaper elsewhere (although shipping is then added in and here on Amazon I use Prime - which I'm finding to be a bit too costly as well). The syrup however; is excellent.  I'll buy it elsewhere.	11
The integrated soap dispenser makes this small, inexpensive brush a very helpful addition to kitchen sink gear. Instant access to additional dish soap lets you get the job done in one effort.Particularly good on frying pans, cutting boards, plates, soup bowls or other shallow cookware -- the small size and chunky handle give you a lot of scrubbing power for caked-on or burnt food.I have not needed to replace it yet, but the removable bristles mean I will not need to replace the entire unit when it begins to show wear!	13
because, as one of the extra bits shows the storyline was starting to take a very dark turn. Another complaint I have is the introduction of several new characters, never to be heard from in following seasons. Claire Benet.'s flying boyfriend?, watch him here- he's not in 3rd season, no explanation. Wasn't the son of Ali Larter's character named Micah?, his Black relatives are introduced here, not one word about any of them next season.I have a feeling that if this season had gone full length the series might've had an even shorter run.	0
I'm not sure how long this worked for...my girlfriend noticed that when she pushed the connection slightly, the bass would suddenly get richer....tested on a Nano and an iPhone 4S. Disappointing but it's a super-cheap cable so....I missed the Amazon claim window by 2 weeks but Eforcity only covers this for 30 days. Where other companies would send out a replacement, no questions asked, this company does not. Buyer beware.NOTE: the connector did fit into the iPhone even with the case on, which was why I purchased it to begin with.	7
"There are a select few comedians who are straight up funny. Some (cough -Dane Cook- cough) use profanity to cover up the fact that their routines aren't really that funny. Not so with Brian Regan. He is a tremendously smart guy, who plays a stupid guy in his comedy.Since he has so much physical comedy though, his facial expressions alone can make you burst out laughing, I was worried that it wouldn't translate well to just audio. I was wrong. From ""Stupid in School"" to ""Fishing Shows"" this is Brian at his best. Two thumbs way up."	6
I purchased a Prazi Bigg Lugg when I was building my pole barn.  I had thousands of screws to put through the galvanized siding, and many of them were driven from atop a ladder 20' in the air.  It takes a third hand to do  this safely, and this tool is it!  I really love how well designed this  tool is.  No matter what position you are in, the drill finds the center of  balance and hangs securely in the clip.  You could stand on your head and  the drill won't fall out.  It's the best [money] I have ever spent.	21
"If you relish a series like ""MISSION: IMPOSSIBLE,"" ""T.H.E. Cat"" or ""77 Sunset Strip"" you no doubt know about the content of what you are getting. You are more likely concerned about the quality of the product. Like John might say, ""You scratch my back and I'll scratch your back. Just watch the hat please."" John is back and are here to stay via DVD technology. Being on DVD, the aesthetics about the actual episodes are not in question here. More appropriately one may ask how they look. They look good, very good."	15
I'm becoming obsessed with hair products so now I always like to have something in my hair even when I'm not styling it. I love this product because it's a spray, and it's quick to use. It doesn't leave my hands sticky, and I can put it in my hair as soon as I get out of the shower. I use it before I use other hair products too. Plus, it smells really good!I mostly love it because it's a spray and not a cream. It's cheap, and I will definitely be buying this again when I run out.	4
I can never find anything that my cats will love and repeatedly eat.  Until I found this dry cat food.  It is almost as if I do not have the same cats.  We have 2 Russian Blue's and they define the term 'picky eater'.  There has been more food wasted because they simply turned away.  Our female would rather starve herself than to eat something that she dislikes, and because of her, we have been searching for something; anything, that she would eat.  Thank you Purina One Beyond Cat Chicken Oatmeal!!!	19
Yard Butler IM-7C Spike Aerator does a great job of aerating your yard and garden.  The thick heavy duty spikes dig into the soil well, and the step guard over the top allows for evenly applied pressure with your foot.  The spikes are very sturdy and there's no need to worry about them bending while you work.  The handle is sturdy as well, offering a grip cover that helps keep a sturdy hold upon the tool while you're using it.If you've got an area that needs deep, aggressive aeration, this is the tool for you!	18
I previously had a &quot;Brand X&quot; melon baller which, with occasional use, developed a cracked handle which I had to tape to keep together and later, the scoop end broke off! I broke down and got the best... the OXO is really sturdy and, as with all their products, comfortable to use. I can tell I'll get years of use out of it without it falling to pieces like my previous one. It just goes to show, even with a product that only gets occasional use, it doesn't pay to get a cheap one!	13
"I *think* this is the episode where someone FINALLY says to Jack what I'd been thinking for about 50 episodes already.""You're cursed, Jack.""THANK YOU. This poor guy. It's like he's got a little black cloud of bad luck that follows him around. Sure, he can pull YOUR bacon out of the fire, but HIS house will burn down in the process.That being said, it make me love Jack and root for him all the more. ""PLEASE let this man have SOMETHING good happen. ANYTHING."""	0
I decided to use these because I wanted the Avent Breast Pump and would use these with it.  Well, my newborn had a hard time latching onto the nipples and when he did they were way too fast with the flow.  He would choke and gasp almost everytime.  I now use the Playtex Ventaire bottles and he doesn't have as much of a problem.  Every baby is different, though, but if you have a baby that tends to want to eat quickly, these won't work so well.	3
On paper this battery should give about 20% more time than the battery that came with my phone.  So far I've had the phone on 3+ days, made some calls, and the charge indicator still shows 4 bars. Needless to say I'm very happy, and for about $5?  What a deal.Not sure why some people are having problems, but the battery came with instructions and I did charge it for a full 8 hours before using it.Note: The battery seems a tad thicker, but the door closes fine.  Just needs a bit of a push.	7
I haven't used it a lot yet, but I really like it so far.. Much easier to put on than the 30 year old capo I was using, and it works for my guitars and my banjo, without putting them out of tune. It seems to be solidly made as well, and not too much pressure as others said.. My old capo put a lot more pressure than this does :P, and was much heavier. I'd assume it was made out of Cast-Iron or something instead of Aluminum.	16
"""Water for Elephants"" is a good read.  The writer confesses to being thrilled to be writing something besides technical documents, and this gives rise to minor annoyances, some as trivial as the overuse of ""stare"".The contrast of mores of the Depression Era to modern day is arrestingly authentic.  Using 1930's circus lingo is misleading (a ""bull"" elephant named Rosie).The symbolism that is not overtly contrived (the big circus in the sky) is captivating, but there is an the almost desperate struggle to parallel the narrator with the biblical story of Jacob."	5
Highlights are You're Making Me High, Talking In His Sleep, Find Me A Man, Let It Flow, Why Should I Care, Come On Over Here and I Love Me Some Him.Filler? Not a lot, but Un-break My Heart comes close and In The Late Of Night/Toni's Secrets is OK and nothing to speak of. So I guess that means no filler! ^_^;;Cover Art: A-Songwriting: B+Vocals: B-Vocal Emotion: A-Production: B+Overall: 4.3754.375 = 4.384.38 stars.	9
While these brush heads are not my favorites to use with myOral-B Professional Healthy Clean + Gum Care Precision 3000 Rechargeable Electric Toothbrush 1 Count, they still do a great job. (For the record, my favorite brush heads are theOral B Floss Action 3 pack brush head refill. I usually rotate the brush heads I use just to change things up a bit. I don't know if it makes a difference, but I feel like using different heads from time to time is a good idea. In any case, these brush heads are great.	12
I've had this watch for awhile now and really like it. I think its pretty and goes well with all my bracelets, silver and gold. It runs well and unlike most other comments, i don't have a problem seeing the time. The only issue to aware of is.. if you don't clamp the latch properly, it will fall off after wearing it all day!  That has happened to me twice. Both times someone had picked it up off floor and gave it back..i didn't even know it was gone!  I got lucky. Otherwise, its great!	8
This is a nice expanding file that seems to be well made, except that the flap is too thin and bendy. There's no way it's going to stay nice looking if you open and close it more than a couple of times... The Velcro is strong, and when you try to open the flap, it's hard to open it gently enough to avoid folding it.I'm using it to store my daughter's artwork/school work, and I'm trying to hande it verrrrrry gingerly, but I do suspect I'll have to replace it at some point.	17
Love the binoculars just like everyone else.  Only complaint is the flimsy attachments.  The neck strap is impossible to attach and is obviously a piece of junk anyway so don't bother.  I find it annoying that the lens covers aren't connected in some way.  They pop off very easily.  Just seems to me like something that could easily be prevented with better design.  All things considered, these are really minor complaints.  The purpose is to get great binoculars for a great price, and that I did.  I would still highly recommend them.	10
I am very impressed with this filter.  I like the bio filtration set up it has, and in my opinion it's not noisy.  It's is easy to clean by just using the water that is removed from the aquarium when doing a partial water change.  When cleaned in this manner the bacteria colony that is in the sponge and ceramic's are not lost like it would be if it was the type that you throw away and replace routinely, which was one of the mistakes I made when I first started fishkeeping.	19
Nice peppermint candies for when you want the lift that a mint can give you.  The fact that they are &#34;soft&#34; makes them easier to eat and you won't break a tooth filling on them if (when) you bite down.  Peppermint flavoring is strong and really peppermint, not the  cheap flavoring that might be as much spearmint as peppermint, and you probably know how disappointing it is to think you are getting peppermint and end up with a taste that is nothing like that except that it's &#34;mint&#34; of some kind.These are good.	11
"I would have to say that this is one of the best ""made-for-TV"" (on TNT) biblical films I've seen. The acting was phenominal, the scenery..EVERYTHING. This movie is dead-on when it comes to accuracy from the Bible, which is pretty rare..almost unheard of in this day in age. It's a refreshing movie that has an honest, uplifting theme that will inspire you and your family. It could have easily been released in the theaters and it probably could have been bigger in popularity with a wider-span of audience around the world. Even so, I'm just glad that I can now buy the DVD! :)"	15
I realize I could have purchased it elsewhere for less price, but since it isn't available locally, and the shipping was free here as an &#34;add-on&#34;  I went with Amazon. I can tell the difference in my breads using this brand over the Fleishmans. It gives a constant even rise.  the best thing I like about this yeast is that I can use it straight from the freezer with same great results, which eliminates the waiting for &#34;room temperature&#34; state required by other yeasts I've used.	11
This can opener is better than any I have owned previously, but not perfect.  After a year or so, the gear mechanism is starting to slip when I first start turning the handle.  Also, the opener does leave a little strip of metal between the can and the lid, as some other reviewers have mentioned.  This is not a good thing, since sometimes the little strip falls into the can when I twist or bend the lid to completely separate it.  However, I have never owned one that doesn't do this.	13
This is well done and I have had in my collection for years along with Domingo and Kiri in Covent Garden production.  I love them both but prefer Covent Garden just a little over this one due to the chemistry of Domingo and TeKanawa who's singing is better than Scotto's as she was beginning to dim vocally.  However, the two productions are so different that they are both required for any opera collection.  Domingo fans will just love him in what he used to say was his &quot;favorite role&quot;.  I recommend both versions!	6
This book is extremely interesting, well-written, and detailed.  A good one to have in the hotel room and read at the end of the day (especially if you have someone to read some of the passages to, it is such good writing,) preparing for the next day's sight-seeing.  However, it is too heavy and detailed to carry around with you and refer to during the day, unless you and your partner are willing to share the toting, and one carries this book and the other carries everything else!	5
This is a classic simple strategy game - it's one of the more simple board games available for 2 players that can still present an interesting challenge without having to struggle too much to understand the rules.  Larger groups of players also work well, but I've found it's hard to find good games that are just as fun with 2 people as they are with more.  Sequence happens to be a game that is particularly great for 2 people (or more.) A great addition to anyone's game collection.	22
Originally, I purchased this for a vehicle engine air intake -- cooler air = more mpg/power.  However, I found that it works well for high temperature halogen lighting fixtures.  In the winter, CFL take too long warm up in a garage door opener.  So, I employ 150 watt halogen lamps.  Even with the translucent fixtures removed, the lamps still melt the dark plastic housing on the garage door opener.  With this heat barrier covering all of the nearby surfaces, not only is the plastic housing protected but better light out is realized.	2
Note that this review refers to the original, I have not seen director's cut.This movie offers a rare inside glimpse at Pink Floyd in full freakdom. It is particularly poignant because it includes clips of floyd recording dark side of the moon, which was to jettison them to permanent stardom. But here you can see them play older psychedelic masterpieces as well as interviews with the band. As always, the band is contrary to most of their peers with their heavy psychedelic approach (and, based on a few of the interviews -- usage!) and intelligent if eccentric rants. A MUST for fans.	6
I have been an amature woodworker for some time now but I'm new to the scroll saw.  I bought this one because I thought it would have little vibration due to it's mass.  Was I ever right!!  Others have said that it has a small amount of vibration, but that doesn't do it justice; this saw doesn't vibrate. That alone has made it a wonderful tool for me.  I can concentrate on learning fretwork instead of wrestling with vibration.The one downfall is the &quot;hold down&quot;. While simple to use, I have a hard time getting the right presure on the workpiece.	21
At first I thought that a self-cleaning razor was gimmicky, but after owning for several years now I think that this function is highly useful and that it keeps the expensive razor and blades in decent condition.  My one complaint about the refills is that because they are alcohol based product, it evaporates, so if you shave infrequently and therefore clean infrequently, the product does not last for very long.  The idea of removing the cartridge and capping is decent, but seems like more of an hassle than it's worth.	12
Do you ever get tired of writing out all the information onto an envelope?  Me too, so I decided to get with the 20th century (I know its now the 21st century) and print out labels.  It was so easy, that I started labeling everything from which tools should be in what drawer of the toolbox to what items are missing from the shelves at work for re-order.  This is great.  Wish I had done this sooner.  As for the brand of labels themselves, they seem to be very high quality but time will tell.	17
I tried this a few years ago as a teenager, when I had some acne.  It was nothing horrible, just a few pimples here and there.  I saw this at the store and gave it a try, did everything I was supposed to and the pores under my eyes increased in size.  I had larger pores after using this product and it took me a while to reduce their size.  I didn't have much acne to begin with and this did seem to help, but the increased pores were a negative.	4
"Works like it is supposed to.  I don't know if I really prefer the squeeze bottle to the spray oil, as both work.  The advantage is supposed to be that you are able to know how much oil your filter requires and can measure it out of the bottle.  I've only used the kit once on the filter on my boat, which is the stock filter and I have no idea the amount of oil it is ""supposed"" to have, so I just applied it as instructed like you normally would.  Good price on Amazon for the kit!"	2
Alright already. It's a great game. Good AI, graphics. Runs well. Atmospheric. Great story and dialogue. Comedy. Blah, blah, blah.Wait a minute. I got a complaint! That movie in the beginning. You can't escape  it. It just goes on and on babbling while you're stuck in a stupid tram  car. Sheesh. What a bore. That kind of nonsense will cost you a star.  Later, I went thru that ride a few times because I grew to like the eerie  understated music. Still, I think I should have been able to skip the intro  movie. Ruined the whole game for me.	23
Everyone knows that the key to weight loss is fewer calories in and more calories out. This app helps to quantify calories in and out. Just being aware helps me curb intake. Excellent functionality and having access on my Kindle, Droid, and  computer makes it very easy to work with. I am writing this almost a year later (1-3-14) and I have lost 30+ pounds using this program. It takes a lot of discipline to do this sort of thing and MyFitnessPro helps me find that discipline.	1
You know why you can't get it on Kindle Fire? It doesn't have a camera, and all devices you can download on do. It utilizes the camera without you knowing, and it identifies the object and says the word. This explains why it needs so much information- it wires to the camera. I didn't realize this until I read you couldn't get it on the fire and it uses a lot of info. If you don't beleive me, you don't, but an app can't utilize 1,000-5,000 dollar equipment.	1
We got this bath for our newborn. Unfortunately we weren't able to use it until very recently when she turned 4 m.o. The issue is that the triangle stopper is very wide on newborn side and my girl was crying when we put her in this tub. Even now she prefers to lay her legs on top of the stopper, not around.So for the first 4 months we used the infant bath seat made by the same company that was absolutely great. And the stopper in this seat is much narrower and much more comfortable for a baby.	3
this is a fantastic app!! i have lost 10 pounds by monitoring my exercise and what i eat.  its not a diet..it just helps you make better decisions about type and quantity of food you eat. i have not given up any foods except those really not very healthy for me to eat.. i just manage my portions.  And I exercise more regularly because i have to log that, as well.  great app...great results!! i am at my goal weight in 3 months!!	1
This story is lovely and you cannot put it down. I read every word from cover to cover. There are also authors notes, an interview with Sara Gruen, and questions for book group discussions.Now back to my title for review. So many of you gave the story away you should not rethink your reviews. Thank G-d, I had already chose to read this book when I read Riding Lessons. I had never read one review on this book before I bought it. I wonder what goody Sara has for us next. It will be fun as long as I stay away from reviews!	5
I absolutely love these mailing labels!  They are convenient, and make life so much easier!  These mailing labels are smaller than certain other types of labels; therefore, more labels will fit on each sheet.  And if you use a lot of mailing labels, then that does you a lot of good.They print so quickly and easily.  Whenever you need a label, just peel it off.  These label sheets save a lot of time and energy, and are so neat.Highly recommended if you use mailing labels.And these are for ink jet printers, which is the type of printer I have at home.	17
This peeler works very well, comfortable handle. Stays sharp.  Our day care kids also like it.Dishwasher safe, too.HOWEVER;The potato eye remover is nearly useless. The leverage is wrong at the tip of the peeler blade.We own an older model OXO Good Grips peeler with the potato eye removers at the base of the blade, near the handle.  Much, much better. The eye removers near the handle are easy, quick, and accurate.This older model has one eye remover on each side, so it works equally well for right-handers and left-handers.Sometimes the best model does not win in the marketplace.	13
"Sara Gruen spins a fascinating tale of murder, love, obsession, and life in Water for Elephants.  The characters were interesting and well developed.  Her portrayal of the elderly was spot-on without being stereotypical.  That's a very difficult thing to do; not many authors are capable of unraveling the story of an elderly character.Her portrayal of circus life is intriguing, and the characters never failed to invoke strong feelings of endearment, horror, amusement, or pity.  I wouldn't call this a ""must read,"" but it is definitely an interesting story that was well written and well researched."	5
I was a huge fan of exploitation cinema back in the day. So I was a bit disappointed when I could not remember ever seeing this 'classic'. And I am even more disappointed for having seen it now. It's not going to win awards (not even Razzies) and everything screams 'tacky', but I guess I'm just mellowing with age. Not for serious fans of realistic cinema or quality films, but certainly for people who enjoy their guilty little delights. I'm just not of those people anymore, I guess.	15
You can't beat this jewel!  It's durable, easy to use, easy to clean, and it does a great job.  Like any other salad spinner, hold it steady with your free hand while it is spinning.  That's all. . .nothing to it!  To clean it afterward, I usually just rinse out the bowl and strainer and let them air dry.  But once every few days or so, I might put them in the sink with soapy water for a real wash.  You won't regret getting this kitchen staple!	13
I bought this strap to use on an acoustic dreadnought guitar. I would have given this item 5 stars but even fully extended it is about 3&#34;-4&#34; too short. As for the quality of the strap, I love the look and feel of the leather. It has a worn and aged texture that looks great and it would be very comfortable to wear while playing if it were longer.My 2 cents in summary- I think for a classical acoustic guitar or for an electric, this strap would work much better. If you have a larger sized guitar, find a longer strap.	16
I have been trying to update my Garmin Nuvi 1450 with the latest maps for quite some time with no success.  I had a 2GB Micro SD card installed in the Nuvi that showed a sufficient amount of free space to allow the update, but it would never complete the download.  On an off chance I ordered this Micro SD and it worked perfectly the first time.  I have no idea why the old card would not work, but now it doesn't matter.  For the low price and free shipping, this is a great deal.	10
"I don't want to give too many spoilers but this was a really interesting little series, two totally distinct personalities in the same body and they discover and then communicate with each other by leaving video messages........One of the personalities is a meek, mild Mr.Nice Guy and the other is a ""rockem sockem"" secret agent who would make James Bond blush.........the fun really starts when the ""secret agent"" personality spends the night with the ""Nice Guy"" personality's wife............it's too bad that they didn't continue the series."	0
"After being disappointed with several of the newer games out (Mideival Total War 2, Neverwinter Nights 2), I re-purchased an old favorite. It's not fancy and the graphics are nothing special, but Starcraft is a solid, fun game. The AI is limited but sometimes I like to set it to  ""melee"" (everyone against me) and see how many computer-players I can fend off. If you're looking for unsophisticated shoot-em-up fun, nothing's better than Starcraft for the price."	23
These little rascals are expensive for what they consist of.  I happened to buy three different brands in a short period, thinking that they should all be generally the same--they are not.  The quality of the wood, how the parts are attached and the beefiness of the screws set this apart from the other two.  I was surprised that the Bessey product was rather cheaply made in comparison.  The differences might not be so apparent unless they were side by side.  These get used frequently in my shop and all three serve the purpose, the Jorgensen just a bit better.	21
We've had this stove for upwards of 25 years, and it has withstood the test of time, weather, and all kinds of camping conditions. The stove has accompanied us on camping outings in Alaska, Canada's wild lakes (for canoe and kayak camping) and on our average family summer camping vacations.It is lightweight, sturdy and a great way to prepare hot cakes, eggs and coffee in the morning.For larger families, there are of course larger Coleman stoves. But for a family of two to four, this item is perfect.	20
PC 97366 has so much vibrations that I had to give it gift to my enemy..  Horrible...  then within a week , I got a Xmas Gift of Home Depot Card and I used it to buy Rigit Sander from Home Depot for $139...  ( I SAID , I CAN RETURN IT IF I DON'T LIKE IT )WHAT A SURPIRISE THEN...  THE RIGID IS SUPREME SANDER WITH ZERO PAIN IN HAND AND AWESOME GERMAN BUILT ...  GREAT BUILD QUALITY AND 3 YEAR WARRANTY...  YOU CAN'T MISS THAT...I CANNOT BELIEVE HOW GOOD RIGID SANDERS ARE...  BYE PORTER CABLE...	21
I use this for my 10 gallon saltwater tank.  Creates enough flow for the whole tank.  To those that dislike the bubbles that this produces, you can reduce the amount of air intake using the air adjuster valve.  You may get a couple bubbles at the lowest setting, but virtually none.  You can also adjust the power of the powerhead.  I am not 100% sure how this would fair in a 20 gallon tank and bigger, but as stated before, it's perfect for my 10 gallon saltwater tank.  It's quiet, does its job.  5 Stars!	19
I have a kindle fire and it doesn't haves microphone.... it took forever to get &quot;duck&quot; from it and like a minute later my lil bro came in and threw a toy at me. couinsidence... my point is that a kindle.fire doesn't have a microphone and if it doesn't have that it cant pick up anything from a &quot;ghost&quot; I also live in an apartment.... Haha FAKE DONT BUY IT RIP OFF EVEN THOUGH ITS TOTALLY FREE ITS JUST GONNA TAKE YOUR APP SPACE UP DONT GET IT!!!!	1
Unfortunately, I am not able to find this bathtub anywhere (( My son used to have it 6-7 years ago). It is great! It is the only one bathtub where a baby does not slip forward and doesn't go under water. This blue gear is awesome. I do not understand why it is discontinued. I do not care if it is leaking. I did not notice that because it was used in adult bathtub. IF SOMEBODY HAS IT, PLEASE, I WILL BUY FROM YOU.	3
I have natural tightly coiled African hair and have tried other hot oils included pure olive oil but wasn't satisfied with the result. I heard about using VO5 from natural hair forums and thought I'd give it a try. While using it in the shower I wasn't particularly impressed, but once my hair dried, I must say I was happy with the result. My very very tight coils were actually loosened quite a bit and hung down to my shoulder....with a lot of bounce. I will defiantly be using this product again.	4
Im not loyal to brands on the whole but when I reach for a pick I hope this is the one I get. They wear out and get nicks so I have to remember to keep ordering them.Edit: Watch the Steve Vai interview where he shares his secret for restoring the edge of worn, nicked, picks. Rapidly,firmly wipe the pick edge against a carpet. The motion is as if you were trying to cut into the carpet with the edge of the pick, repeat 3 or 4 times and whadda u know! The edge is now smooth and nice.	16
My two year old was excited to try and piece this one together (with lots of help).  The pieces are large and quite sturdy.  This is good because the puzzle size is large and the little ones are bound to walk on the pieces.The puzzle design is interesting and provides lots of visual cues on where the pieces go.  This is great for kids who are learning how to figure out puzzles.It comes in a cute box with a carrying handle.Would make an excellent gift too.	22
I was thrilled to get the Rosetta Stone and be able to begin a lifelong desire to speak Italian!The software was very easy to load and use. The simple approach to learning a language as a child does was one terrific idea!I agree with other posters that to become fluent you will need to purchase more than just this level 1 program. However, this does allow you to learn some simple things and I do feel you could communicate enough to get your idea across.And, it is FUN to do! I'm enjoying it immensely!	8
"I love the original Mocha Chip balance bars.  They were terrific.  But, they put them in new packaging (fine, who cares, right?) but they also re-formulated them and it's really sad what they've done to them.  They're sickly sweet now, they have a cake-y consistency that's not appealing and there's barely a ""chip"" in sight.It's all bad.  I bought tons of these and ate them for breakfast.  No more.  The new ones are so bad, I threw out the ones I bought after trying a few times to eat them."	12
For me, this book reminded me of being a little kid.  I could picture myself sitting at the foot of my grandfather's bed as he told me stories of his youth and the adventures that came with it.  I was instantly transported to the 1930's and to the world of the traveling circus.  The author wrote with such clarity and viviid realism, that I was shocked when I later read that at the time she started writiing the novel, she has never been to a circus.  This novel is beautiful and moving, and certainly one that I will pass along to others.	5
I got some at the World Market before they went out of business and searched a lot of stores as I painstakingly used it sparingly for years thinking I would never find it again.  I have and this is my third jar.  It is terrific and not so citrusy as the copy cats.  Spruces up everything from hamburger helpers to eggs.  I use it on steak & hamburgers along with some salt based seasoning to increase the flavor and not the salt.  It is the best spice for fish ever!	11
I really wanted to like this book, I really enjoyed learning some of the slang and history of the circus.  I like the circus and I was told I'd fall in love with the animals and the characters of this book.  The fact is I hated the raunchy descriptions surely we could do without those.  I felt the book to be dark, twisted and weird.  I did indeed love the animals but didn't like the characters.  Honestly - I only read half the book because of these things.  Too bad.	5
What can I say? A pop masterpiece, especially if you sequence &#34;Wouldn't it Be Nice&#34;, &#34;Don't Talk&#34;, &#34;Let's Go Away for a While&#34;, &#34;God Only Knows&#34;, &#34;I Just Wasn't Made for These Times&#34;, &#34;Pet Sounds&#34;, and &#34;Caroline, No&#34;. I would compare &#34;Caroline, No&#34; in particular to Bacharach's and David's and Warwick's &#34;Anyone Who Had a Heart&#34;: as good as the genre gets.	9
I wet the section in front of the bristles with Hoppe's #9 and the tail section with CLP for a complete bore cleaning. I run it through 3-4 times and it scrubs out any leading or copper fouling and leaves the bore with a thin layer of oil when I'm done. I prefer this much more than a rigid rod that can cause damage to the breach. After 3-4 uses it gets washed in the washing machine and then hung over a closet door to dry and it's ready for service again.	20
I do not understand the negative reviews.  Thanks goodness I did not pay much attention to them when I ordered, as I would have missed out on a great value with this set.The peeler is effortless and smooth as silk to use, peeler away from you normally.  Great control and the blade is sharp as can be, making a carrot easy work.  The paring knife is sharper than my brand new Victorinox 8-inch knife.  Cuts through carrots and onions easily and with the barest effort.The handles are typically Oxo:  large, comfortable, and steady.	13
"I've been wearing Levi's 505's since the 1960's. Recently Levi's changed the style of 505's from ""regular fit"" to ""straight fit"". The straight fit has a lower waist that I don't like.I reluctantly tried 501's. I was nervous about the button fly.However, the results were great; I really love 501's now. They fit me better than even the old style of 505's. The material feels stronger than the 505's. The button fly isn't a problem; just undo the middle buttons when you need access, there is no need to unbutton the top."	8
I don't want to drown you with hoopla, so I'll just tell you that my wife really isn't into games. She really isn't, and I'm not going to say that Metal Gear got her to grab the controller all of a sudden because it didn't. What it DID do is hold her attention indefinitely. For the first time ever, she actually encouraged me to play, play, play. The storyline, action, yada, yada, yada is that good. Really. I'm surprised a Metal Gear Movie isn't in theatres yet.	23
The Palm V is one of those electronic gizmos you don't think you'll ever need, and then when you get one you can't live without it. I've been carrying mine around like a pacifier.  When someone stops me on the street  and wants to set up and appointment I used to take their number and check  my calendar back at the office.  Now I can take their number AND make the  appointment.3Com has packaged a proven product in a sexy case and come  up with a real winner.	10
Avery wasn't kidding when they named these business cards Clean Edge.  They really break off with clean edges and it's so easy, too. The quality of the paper is superb and I printed with an ordinary inkjet printer and there were no smears or streaks. The sheet will tell you how to load in the paper and how to break off the cards.  They also include instructions on how to download free software from Avery and the website also has a lot of templates for business cards and other projects.  Avery is really awesome for business and creative needs!	17
This house may (or may not) leak, but it has a much more serious problem.  My new hose reel requires female fittings on both ends of the leader hose and this 10 foot leader has a male fitting on one end and a female on the other, so it's useless.  My new reel requires a female fitting for attachment to the reel and it of course requires a female fitting at the faucet end (as do all faucets).  Also, the product smells really bad, so I'm returning it to Amazon.	18
What a great film from the 70s Disco era starring Donna Summer and others (including the lead singer of Berlin, Terry Nunn!).  The Commodores also make an appearance.  The film is funny and keeps your interest.  The soundtrack is an absolute MUST for anyone looking for the top hits back in the days of DISCO!  Donna also gives a great performance of &#34;Last Dance&#34; at the end.  This movie is a MUST for any DISCO fan, like me.  I love it, I love it, I absolutely LOVE IT!  Enjoy!	15
I SHOULD SAY DID IT AGAIN. WHY WOULD ANYONE CANCEL THIS FIVE STAR SHOW?  IT IS ONE OF MY FAVORITES. THE DRAMA IS REAL LIFE, THE MEDICAL TERMS ARE PERFECT FOR THAT ERA AND THE ACTING SURPERB. REALITY TV AT ITS BEST. I WOULD GIVE THIS 10 STARS PLUS. LIKE A REALLY GOOD BOOK, I DID NOT WANT THIS TO END. YOU FEEL A LOSS AFTER. IT POPS INTO MY HEAD EVERY DAY. THATS THE SIGN OF A GOOD DRAMA... TOTALLY WORTH WATCHING EVEN IF IT IS JUST THE TWO SEASONS......CAT	0
This works great for my Marlin Model 60.  Some people do not care for bore snakes, but I personally do not mind that they do not get my gun surgically clean.  The trade off for me is ease of use.  Dab some CLP or other solvent directly onto the snake above the bristle section and pull through three times, good to go.  When these things start to get filthy, you can either wash them by hand with soap and hot water, or put them in a sock and toss them in the washing machine.	20
Water for Elephants, by Sara Gruen, is a pleasurable book to read.  Among its many virtues, is Guren's recreation of the atmosphere of depression era America, and a unique circus subculture that existed in what now must be viewed as the lost past.  Leading this tale is a genuinely likeable guy, a rarity in contemporary literature.  This hugely popular book is without serious lessons to preach or meaning to convey.  Rather, it is a good story which provided me with many hours of pleasant diversion.	5
I bought two of these and I just love them.  I use both of them at the same time--one for his head, the other for his butt. They do the trick of catching spit-up, vomit, and leaking diaper problems.  These pads save me a lot of time beacuse I don't have to worry about doing the sheets all the time. They're getting a little fuzzy now that they've been through the wash a few times, but for $7, I think these pads are a great buy!!	3
I purchased 2 of these for my recent cross-country move to protect my kitchen-wares and fragile stuff (e.g. lamps, picture frames, a porcelain owl, etc.).  I did not lose any dishes, cups, bowls, and other fragile items during the move I'm sure in part thanks to the Scotch Cushion Wrap.  The perforations 12 inches help make it easy to tear proper lengths of bubble wrap and you can easily fold or stack them back up for re-use.  I have no complaints and will probably buy again for my next move.	17
Why in the hell would a company like DEWALT sell this item without DEWALT DW4706 4-1/2-Inch Backing Flange for the DW402, DW402G, and DW818?  I bought the 4 1/2 inch grinder and this blade will not function without the backing flange.  The flange is not included with the grinder and no mention of the flange is included in the requirements for this blade or the grinder.  Seriously disappointed by DEWALT.Once I bought this flange, the wheel working very well in cutting fire brick and ceramic floor tile.  Lost several days of productivity due to the lack of full disclosure.	21
This sensational DVD, culled from a TV show I have cloudy memories of from my youth, presents Andy Kaufman in a way that surpasses the Milos Forman biopic (not to denigrate Jim Carrey's outstanding performance) and the  A&amp;E Biography. You get it all here, and it's mostly hilarious. Best of  all is Mr. Kaufman's dead-on Elvis impersonation...his choice of songs is  impeccable--&quot;Too Much&quot; is an Elvis hit that Mr. Presley seldom  performed live. Great introduction (or reintroduction?) to this fascinating  character.	15
I love almost all of Hemingway's novels, but this one was a daunting effort.  Line by line, or a paragraph at a time, the writing is Hemingway at his best.  Yet, inexplicably, I found that as one chapter segued interminably to the next, the story and style became muddled and could not sustain my interest.  There is much, however, that is worth the time...themes of monogamous love, war/conscience, life/death.  The heart wrenching finale illustrates the notorious he-man's mastery to convey softer, &quot;feminine&quot; sensitivity.  Definitely not the one to kick off a reader's Hemingway exposure.	5
I've purchased the 3mm, 4mm, 5mm sizes in the past. I was happy with all, but not with this new pair of 5mm size. These are from a different manufacturer/supplier, Leach and Garner. While they look good, the posts are very slippery and the backs don't stay on tight, slipping off very, very easily. I have thin to average ear lobes, but found I couldn't wear these without them falling off (potentially, getting lost). Otherwise, they would have been fine. I returned them and would not buy this pair again.	8
This is a shoe for travel, I read other reviews and decided it was what I needed for a visit to Easter Island.Sand, water, rocks, hiking, slick rocks and such, heat, comfort.  Wow these are just great for everything and my feet are happy at the end of the day.  Remember to put suntan lotion you the tops of your feet as mine are now look like a checker board from the sun.  I took them on to Thailand and even in the city they were great.  You can't go wrong with these sandals.	8
We had purchased Melissa & Doug magnets & had some made & went looking for a board.  THIS IS IT!  It is so reasonable and has been in use ever since we received it.  You can spell words, put the Leap Frog base on it to put in letters/animals, numbers, etc.  It is also double sided.  Even though it's not intended they also like to put things under/inside the board.  They can roll things through it.  Highly recommend & every child should have one to put their magnets on.	22

Do not attempt to use a loader with a revolver for which it was not intended.	20
I'm not sure if I would wear this in public, but I got this because of the good reviews it received with regard to sound quality & noise cancellation. Sound is crsytal clear & deep. I got it to work with the Sony Bluetooth adapter, Sony Vaio laptop, my Nokia cell phone, & my iPod Touch. A big plus is that you can use it as a passive headset by plugging in a 3.5 mm audio cable. It's a good idea to purchase the carrying case to protect it while transporting or storing.	7
I really don't get it! I always order the same size sweat shirts and hooded shirts from Hanes but somehow the sizes are always different. Also this batch had the label, the previous ones had no label, just the print inside. I am kind of picky how these (for me oversized) shirts fit, and unfortunately these are just BIG. Shoulders are wider, waist band is wider and they just look as if I wear something from my &#34;big brother&#34;. Hanes might have different factories and some just cut larger.	8
Fanciulla should be lively....rugged men, perky young gal.... but Neblett acts like a 40 year old school marm and is not helped by the ponderously slow tempi.  This ain't Wagner!!  Phrases that should bounce and sparkle are more like dirges.  Domingo is ordinary as usual, but sings a bit better here than in the Met production.  I usually like Carolli, but not so much here.......rather stiff and one dimensional.So why did I give 4 stars.........the sets and costumes are fantastic.  Altho Minnie's cabin has elaborate china and stuff you would never expect in a wilderness cabin.	6
"This curling iron is perfect for creating big, soft waves on my shoulder length hair. You can adjust the heat settings and get it pretty hot if you have harder to curl hair. I really like how it smoothes out the frizzies as it curls, so my hair is wavy and smooth.  Because the barrel is so big, the curls aren't tight at all and I like that for a more casual look.  I'm really happy because it gives me nice hair without looking overly ""fixed."""	4
I used for 1 day and and it destroyed itself with a pine needle.  Now I get streaks where the pine needle, or any other item I assume, has been dragged. So unless you are meticulous and clean your blades before you use them everyday and or get out of your car and clean them immediately anytime any item may fall onto your window, do not buy these.  Unless you do not mind streaks.  The damage is permanent, not only when the item is still on the window.	2
its stupid and pointless and ghost aren't even reel when you die you go to heaven or hell you cant go around the earth when your dead!!!! this is crape its totally stupid and its not real how would the developer get the app to sense all that stuff its crape lies!!! I mean seriously if your stupid enough to beloved this *omg it works I saw a ghost* -_- really?!...... get a life spud pickles and make something worth our time!!! God loves you :D	1
These are tiny, tiny earrings.  Yes, the photo shows the measurements, but it is so extremely magnified that you don't realize they are half-an-inch EACH...and that's not big at all.  The photo must be at least 5x larger than actuality.  Other than that, they're pretty, but way too small.  I was buying these for my grandmother, but had to rush to get her something else once I received these.  I will definitely be more careful when buying jewelry online!	8
I purchased Levi's 505 regular fit for my Husband, and he is hard to find the right length, the size is no problem. he had lost 51-lbs of weight from being ill, now he is eating better. so, i got 34x29. my husband tried them on and they fit to a T, even after i washed them. Levi's is the only denim this family can wear, they are the perfect fit. I highly recommend Levi's brand denim, they have been around since the 1853.	8
I own three Emma's: this one, Paltrow's and another BBC production from the 70's. The mettlesome Kate Beckensale is perfectly cast opposite Mark Stong as Knightley who brings needful gravitas to the role. The deception of the pretentious Frank Churchill is stylishly carried off by Raymond Coulthard. And who could not admire the lovely Olivia Williams as the silent suffering Miss Jane Fairfax? The talented Samantha Morton is the ill-advised Miss Harriet Smith. None detract from this virtually flawless production.Only one thing could improve: A release in anamorphic widescreen as I've seen aired on public television instead of this full-screen (1.33:1) version.	15
Chex Mix Bold is tasty, although the mix differs from the package shown. I like it better than the old version, as I found the round crackers in the old version rather bland. The cereal is crispy, the rye crisps crunchy and the flavor is just the right bold for me (there's a similar store brand version of this at Food Lion and it is way too oniony for my taste buds!). My only complaint about the new Chex Mix Bold is that the pretzels aren't really crispy and sometimes taste on the stale side, ruining an otherwise perfect snack food!	11
Sounds and feels nice. I have an entry level guitar, a Peavey Rockmaster. It came with entry level strings. These strings make it sound like an upgraded instrument.Be advised, the low E string is thick. When I try to depress the 12th fret, I can't get it to register as a hit with Rocksmith 2014 unless I press HARD with my middle or index finger. Well, sometimes the pinky is needed to do that. Plan on a weaker score if you learn guitar using this game.	16
We've been using Mach 3 razors since the 1990s, and I buy this 15-pack here on Amazon because they're cheaper at $1.84/each than buying them at Costco.  Add in free SuperSaver or Prime shipping and they're a great deal!We like that the Mach 3 razor cartridges last for several weeks, even with daily shaving.  They give a smooth, close, nick-free shave without any irritation, and the blades don't rust when left in the shower.We've tried all kinds of blades through the years, and always come back to Mach 3.	12
"There are 5 double-length episodes here that increase the episode count from 14 to 19.  And at 19, that is just 3 episodes short fo a current full season.What does puzzle me is the varying lengths of the half hour episodes, some are as short as 20 minutes & 30 seconds; others clock in at 21 minutes & 40 seconds.  Are some cut?If you get the 5-disc version some retailers are selling for the same price, then it is worth picking up!  Disc 5 has a Q & A session from the Scranton  ""The Office"" convention."	0
I did a bunch of pruning with ease using these fine shears. However, when I tried to lock them shut I could not get the lock arm to return to its initial position to lock the shears closed. I decided to check the reviews again more thoroughly to see if others had the same problem. A reviewer suggested loosening the Phillips screw holding the lock arm. I followed that advice and the result removed the slight negative feeling I had toward these shears and now all is well. These may well be the best shears I have ever owned.	18
There's not much to say here other than it's a solid Rush album. I did not start listening to Rush until late 80s/early 90s, so I never was exactly in love with their 70s stuff (though I later learned to like it).  The musicianship is great, as always.  Seeing them on tour a few years ago was one of the best musical experiences of my life.  I would definitely recommend that if you like their stuff, go see them live and damn the price of the ticket.  It will be worth it,  believe me.	6
I only wish the label maker itself had better directions on how to install and set up for the various widths of tape available.  But that is no fault of the replacement tape itself.  The lengthwise split in the backing makes removal of the backing VERY easy.  Additionally, it allows the user to stick the label on across only one half of the label first to make sure it's straight and get out any bubbles or creases - then remove the other half of the backing to smooth the label on the rest of the way.  Very good design.	17
Inexpensive vacuum hose that works well in many applications.  Not quite as stiff and strong as the more expensive hose, but I needed some short lengths to connect to some tools, and this worked out just fine. It does not collapse under a strong vacuum pressure. The thin vinyl covering over a spiral wire makes the hose very flexible. Just pull the length you need out of the 4' long box and cut it off. It will require a hose clamp to attach tightly to a hose coupling or tool coupling.	21
I highly recommend Mobil synthetic 5w-30 and 10w-30.  I have been using it in all of my cars, ATV, home generator, and 10w-30 in my trucks since 1990 and all who have worked on my engines comment how clean they have been. All quick to start in Montana cold weather, always better MPG than manufacturer stated, never overheating, and no oil consumption with age.  I recommend starting from the beginning with your vehicle.  It is an excellent product, even recommended adding a little to your chain saw bar-oil for all season cutting, especially cold weather when bar oil can gum-up.	2
The handle sure is comfortable, just as you'd expect from OXO. Unfortunately this jar opener does not work all that well. Instead of gripping the jar lid with non-slip rubber, it grips it with metal teeth. These sometimes slip off rather than gripping. And when they do grip, the usually leave quite a mark in the jar lid -- sometimes even cutting through very thin lids. Often takes 2-3 tries to open a single jar.Skip this product and instead buy a jar opener that grips the jar lid with rubber or a similar non-skid, non-damaging material.	13
I use this tub along with the Safer Bather and absolutely love it.  While on vacation at a friends home I about lost my mind without this tub.  She had another baby tub and my daughter was sliding all over the place.  I have used the Eurobath with the Safer Bather from the start with my baby and she doesn't slide anywhere.  She is now 8 months old and loves to kick and play in the water.  I plan to buy this for my friend when she has her next child.  I think every parent needs a safe tub.	3
"Fairly predictable quest plotline with the usual characters but enough character development to keep me (as a character driven reader)entertained.The first quarter of the book was probably the most interesting, with more action, the latter third could have been shortened. The fight sequences were generally good, I ended up skimming the rather extended descriptions of the 'mental travail' of the main characters during their final confrontation with the witch. In those descriptions, I think less would have worked better.Overall, an entertaining read without any major flaws but unfortunately no real ""wow' factors either that would encourage me to keep the book to re-read."	14
The shoe runs narrow.  The inside label says both &#34;B&#34; and &#34;D&#34;, B is printed on top of a line and D is printed underneath.  I don't know what that means, I ordered D width, but they seem to be a B width by appearance.  HOWEVER, they are very comfortable anyway on my wide feet!  They are well-made and quite attractive, I can wear them with nice dresses/skirts.  I am going to order more.	8
One of the best documents of the sixties and the music that affected people and society. D.A. Pennebaker who also directed Dylan's Don't Look Back and later The Rolling Stones Altamount Concert Gimme Shelter has crafted another winner. Highlights include The Who smashing their guitars, Eric Burdon and his new version of the Animals, Janice Joplin, Otis Redding and of course Jimi Hendrix with covers of Wild Thing and Dylan's Like A Rolling Stone among his heart pounded numbers. But the scene where Jimi &quot;sacrifices&quot; his guitar is the most unforgettable image left on the viewers consciousness, simply mesmerizing.	6
First, I must say that I rarely give a book 5 stars, especially fiction, but Mr. Clancy has created one of the most intriguing books I have read. The plot(s), characters, and dialogue are simply exceptional and for the first time with one of Clancy's novels, I can honestly say that it wasn't long enough. This a book that has it all.....action, fierce characters, compassion, heartache, oh, and did I mention ACTION. This will be one of the quickest 750 page reads you will ever have!	5
"If you have not already noticed, Diablo is easily located within Dungeons and Dragons. This is actually a benefit for Diablo, since it has very little story going on. This RPG/action hybrid is nice and it's multiplayer community is huge. Too bad there are millions of cheaters. Just be legit and everyone else will catch on. The game offers lots of fun. Not many complaints though. They are really your choice as to if they're bad or good. Get the game if you want. Not a wasted ""money""."	23
For anyone who likes board games, miniature games or Sci Fi in general or Star Wars in particular, this is a great, fun, simple game that can be a beer 'n' pretzels affair or deeply tactical if you want it to be.The presentation and build of the models and included card stock pieces is first rate. The packaging protective and re-usable and the delivery I received from Amazon was super speedy.The Y Wing adds turrets and some great other abilities to the game. A little more complex to play, but the models look great and they are loads of fun to use in-game	22
My 6 year old daughter asked for a helicopter (RC) so I searched reviews and this seemed to get good ones so I bought it.  It was her favorite Christmas present.  It's really cool and she is able to control the helicopter pretty well.  It had a bunch of crash landings at first, yet held up fine (I couldn't believe it!)  The only bummer is you can't pick the color.  The color in the amazon ad is red and my daughter said that's what she wanted but we got blue.  Oh well, it was still well-received!	22
This app is one of the better webs offered on amazon.  The problem is that I also have friendcaster for facebook.  I do not need two apps for both.  I prefer using facebook to twitter anyway.  Friendcaster for facsnook is the better app.  Ed. I do not see the benefit of having seperate lists for twitter users.  I do not follow a huge number of subjects, so using this feature does not make sense.  Still, it is a good app if you like twitter.	1
We bought this unit after researching several options. We knew this had a space for an ice pack, but it wasn't until we got it home that we could see that the ice pack only keeps one compartment cold at a time--the one that is in the &#34;open&#34; position. The other four compartments are not kept cold. We don't prefer to portion and freeze our pet food ahead of time. The idea was to make it more convenient, not make it strategically more challenging. For wet food, this is not a good choice.	19
because I ordered this device along with a backup camera for my RV.  However, when I went to install the backup camera, their instructions said not to install it if there is a back up alarm installed.  The only reason that I could think of was that the current draw of both the camera and the alarm my exceed the fuse capacity of the backup lights and cause it to fail.  Anyway, I am further researching this and hope to get this resolved soon.  So the product looks good and is well packaged.  But I have not tried it yet.	2
this stuff really helps prevent rust on nuts and bolts. i lubed up my brake studs with the permatex anti seize and it lasted through out the whole winter without needing to be re-applied again. i actually apply this on every bolt i have to take out on my car like the struc bolts, tie-rod, axle nut, brake caliper bolts, etc. i dont know how well this would work against exhaust bolts however. the permatex anti seize does say it can tolerate 500 degree F of heat but never had the chance to test that out.	2
these are the best bras for a full busted woman.  i wear 36J and had to go up a cup to 36JJ because i am 20 weeks pregnant.  love my panache !  always great coverage.  And wish they were made in a nursing bra!  by the way i have had full busts my whole life and find that panache fits me the best. I dont have a wide back just very large breasts. so the cup always fits well and they are easy on the eye. wear your right size ladies! and you will never look bad!	8
"I picked this game up at a store because it was on sale.  Got home and read reviews...almost returned it.  Glad I didn't because it actually works very well for my kids.  My daughter (4) and son (2 1/2) both love it and can always make a ""basket"" within about 4 tries.  My kids were actually better at it than my husband and myself!  Granted, we have to center the doggy for them so they're lined up to flip the ants, but I don't mind that.  Definitely wasn't too difficult for them."	22
We have another plastic swinging door for our indoor/outdoor cat, but this one is for a sliding screen door on one of our decks. It's the right size for our cat, was installed in just a few minutes, and works perfectly. The little movable locks on the bottom sides didn't stay in place, but wouldn't have stopped our cat if she wanted to get in or out. We taped over them because they would slide to easily all by themselves. We close the glass door to keep her in or out when necessary.	19
I bought this for my husband after his other velcro-banded watch stopped working. He loves it! The wrist opening is a little small and he has to &#34;squeeze&#34; his hand through the opening, but other than that he has all praises for this watch. He mentioned that sometimes he has to check to see if he is still wearing it because it is so light and comfortable. Also, the date stamp on the face and the Indiglo light make it a perfect day to night watch. Highly recommended!	8
I love these headphones; they've got superb sound (particularly the bass region--I didn't know headphones were capable of this kind of bass!), they're very portable, inexpensive, and the accessories &amp; features it comes with are great.  They're also very comfortable (particularly because of the foam pads that secure the phones behind/above your ears), although I have a small head and I've heard that these phones don't fit so well on bigger heads.  I also like the way they look, and the lifetime warranty is a nice bonus.	10
"This show was based on TRUE methods of determining/detecting the veracity of a spoken statement - micro-muscle twitches, raised eyebrows, etc.  It was fascinating to watch ""the team"" read the lies on people's faces.  It was well-written and acted.  I can only believe that those who did not want to have it continue on the air are those who regularly lie and did not want to teach others how to catch them.  I am thrilled to have the series forever, even though I would love to see more episodes."	0
After laughing the whole way home from the mall after seeing what looked like clown shoes for $150 or more I was glad to find these on Amazon.  Ok, I admit I'm in my mid forties but I'm sorry the multicolored goofball shoes I saw didn't impress me much, they just look ridiculous.  These however have a simple clean look and are some of the best fitting athletic shoes I've ever owned.  I like a snug fit and these fit like a glove.  You might not be the gym peacock but your workout won't suffer.	8
"It is a small pillow, most useful underneath another pillow to give you a little elevation. It's really too uncomfortable to lay directly on it, maybe if you just wanted to put it between your legs it'd be okay. I don't think I'd call this a ""pregnancy pillow"" - it's too small. My wife needed full upper body elevation and a pillow 1/4 the size of her back (and only 4"" tall) isn't going to help. However this worked good for just head elevation (with another pillow on top)."	3
I have been listening to headphones over the past 30 years or more. From AKG, Sony, B and O, Bose, Senheiser and among others (such as the overpriced Beats by Dr. Dre)  After listening to earbuds i have found that the sonic quality, price and comfort cannot be beat at this price point. For less than $50 including shipping these headphones are a dream to listen to. With the adjustable temple force you cannot get anything better to listen to music from many different sources. I don't abuse headphones so these will last me a long time.	10
I liked the ending of this book better than any other part. This mans life after the death of his parents was hard, as expected. It dragged on for me, until the end when he was living his last years of his life in a nursing home. his children disregarded him emotionally. They went to visit, but real interest in him was gone. They did their duty. He escapes in the end and lives out his life with the circus. The place where he lived most of his life after his parents death.It was good, not great for me.	5
It has an eye-angled, upright display, and is perfect to work on a desk. The keypad is not as soft as other calculators on the market, giving you a retro and reliable feel (if you have ever used those full size desktop calculators popular a decade ago, you know what I am talking about.)I find other calculators (e.g., Sharp EL-377T) awkward to use on a desk. They are perfect for handheld. If you want to have a calculator on your desk and operate with one hand and without leaning forward to check the LCD screen, this Canon LS-82Z is perfect for you.	17
Unless you need a pretty box, the mail order only version  (One Touch Ultra Mail Order Test Strips, 50 CT) is exactly the same as these, but cheaper.If you're paying for test strips yourself, you should look at the WaveSense meters. (See:Wavesense Keynote System Kit)  The WaveSense strips are roughly $9 per box less expensive.  If you're using 8-10 strips per day, that translates to a $1000+- savings each year.  The WaveSense meters also claim to be more accurate than other systems.	12
"For just counting steps while walking, this is a decent product. However, it is not totally accurate if you go running. Also, car rides can sometimes increase your step count is the road is a bit too bumpy.The setting for measuring distance is not accurate at all, but I don't really mind.The belt clip is sturdy. I haven't had any problems with it breaking or the pedometer falling off.Also, this pedometer is definitely purple. I'm not sure why they labeled it as ""blue"" when it is without a doubt purple."	20
When I was younger, this was a a great toy that you had, however, the more you used it/shaked it, the more bubbles that got into the blue water, sometimes making the answer hard to read.  But apps don't have bubbles and this fascinates my niece who has never even heard of a magic 8 ball....she plays it often.  Also, if I have my kindle at work, this is a fun app and a great tension breaker when we are having brainstorming meetings.	1
One of the brightest sitcoms in TV history, with a stellar, never-miss ensemble cast. Unfortunately, it is also the most heavily edited, or as I prefer to call it, censored, ones.Get these tapes while they are still in print if you can swing it, you won't be sorry to have them.I don't look for the studio to pump money into an old show and  ever release the full series uncut with original dialogue, minutes, and music on DVD or VHS, and too bad. It is probably the only thing I would ever pay $1000.00 for.	15
No. I wasn't referring toTJ Wisemen RCFM222 Remote Controlled Fart Machine No. 2I mean, some times a dry cleaner works better than a wet one. Often I'll do a dry one,then follow it up with a wet one likeMaxell VP-200 VHS Wet CleanerI wouldn't recommend a WET one followed by a DRY one... that might bind you all up orsomething. I hate it when my stuff gets all bound up and it requires being opened up bya professional.I hope I have layed/laid... PUT all the options ON the table. Buy these before they gothe way of... of.... VCRs!Thank you!	10
After reading other reviews on this shoe, I did go with a wide instead of a medium width.  My experience in the past with LifeStride shoes is that they do run narrow.  So, the wide width is a perfect medium for me.  These sandals are comfortable, nice looking and easy to put on and take off.  The soles are non-skid and they wipe off readily.  I would have given them a 5 star rating except that the width has to be adjusted up, which the average new customer would not know without reading the product reviews.	8
Alvita provides tea of consistent goood quality.  Rooibos is a wonderful tea that stands on its own as a tasty tea, or as a substitute for those of us who cannot have caffeine!!  This tea brews up to a nice dark earthy flavor which I love to drink with cream!!  Delicious!! I like it strong so I brew it with two bags for at least 20 minutes and then reheat.In addition to the delicious flavor, rooibos has health benefits due to a high antioxidant level that some are saying is higher than green tea.	11
"I have this hooked to a Sears Shop Wet/Dry Vacuum.  As others have noted, the attachment size is a little ""non-standard"", probably due to the fact that the hose fits over the tools instead of sliding in them.  Nonetheless, the hose and swivel are easy to use and the material makes for very efficient pickup.  I also like the claw and crevice nozzle.  They are a bit small for small spaces in my small car, but they are great for going over floors, seats, and jobsite pickup.  Definitely recommended over the stock hose that comes with most shop & wet/dry vacs."	21
"They're light, they're tough, they work.  I have no qualms with sliding under my car when they're on these ramps.HOWEVER -- Because they're light, you want to use them only with drive wheels, otherwise they won't stay in place as you climb the ramps.  And because they're light, I'd advise using them only with smaller vehicles.  Honda Civic?  Yes.  Crown Vic?  No.And regardless of what kind of ramp I use, I always position an extra floor jack under the car ""just in case""."	2
Every year I make up a Christmas present box of alternative medicines for my son, who is prone to colds and hacky coughs.  This year I included a variety of Traditional Medicinals teas.  I was quite surprised to receive an unexpected phone call from him raving about Throat Coat's wonderful taste and soothing qualities.  I couldn't agree more.Usually I get feedback (good & bad) about some alternative I've given him, but never that quickly. Throat Coat's ingredients are a winning combination.  I notice they make organic Lemon Echinacea Throat Coat too--that may go in next year's Christmas care box.	11
I bought this on a whim to play with my D&D; friends when we don't have enough players for our regular game.  It is enjoyable and novel as a result of the clear card format.  The art is interesting and the flavor text on teh cards is great.  I recommend.The loss of the fifth star is largely the result of the cost and the quality of the cards.  My set is a little bit cloudy and they have gotten moderately less clear with minimal use.I also bought the expansion and made identical comments there as well.	22
The battery-operated Havahart DO64MS Deer Off sprayer seems useful for those with weak hands, but at an additional cost of replacement batteries. This all-natural organic formula repels by taste and odor deer, rabbits, squirrels and possibly other nuisance animals unless they are starving or otherwise out of normal control, e.g. rabid.  This is not an industrial repellent working against anything that walks, but rather for the suburban home and garden use.  Its garlic, putrescent egg, and capsaicin are not offensive to all people and thus applicable not only in gardens, lawns, and landscaped areas, but also some basements, cellars, and storage.	18
This was too big for our two month old and he was very uncomfortable. His neck is still unstable so I had to hold his neck the entire time while taking a bath rather than it whacking on the hard plastic. Also the protruding centerpiece is a good place to crush a baby's balls so watch out especially if he's too small to fit in the tub properly! I think this tub would be good for older infants or toddlers but not for our two month old. Hopefully in the future we can use it again.	3
Only reason I gave these two stars is because I got them so cheap and they last for a time. Overall, I find that these ear plugs simply do not last nearly as long as virtually any other ear plug I've used. I might use them for a week and they're shot. The comfort level is good but they quickly get deformed. If I had my choice, I used to use these 3m ear plugs and a set of those would last nearly two months. But I have a hard time finding those anymore. *sigh	12
i gave this to my boyfriend for christmas and he loves it. once you put all the stuff in the bowl it only takes 15 minutes, though it should be noted that it then needs a few hours in the freezer to freeze up fully and that many recipes require a little prior prepping. i still think this is the easiest one you will find and it's a big plus to not need ice or salt. very easy to clean and there is an opening at the top so you can watch it work. very cool.	13
Our German Shepherd, Gabby, is so energetic when we give her these, which is every morning. She does prefer the roasted beef Zuke's better, but loves these, also. The vim and vigor that she gets from these are unbelievable and she is very peppy after consuming the recommended amount. I think highly of this product and believe that the ingredients make a huge difference in the well being of our pup! She is happier, springier, and does not act like an old lady, like she used to! Awesome stuff!!	19
This movie will make you laugh til you cry, it really is hilarious from beginning to end. Woody Allen is at his best in this film that he also directed.I'm giving it 4 stars as I did not like Janet Margolin as his girlfriend in this movie, thought a better choice could have been made to play this role. She seemed to be reading the lines throughout, not breathing any life into the role.Other than that, loved everything about this film. A great pick me up if you've had a bad day and need some big laughs. This one is a keeper!	15
You should pick up at least one of every expansion pack to this game.  They add new pilot and upgrade cards that are quite useful, in addition to another ship.  The model is perhaps the most detailed pre-painted model at this scale I've seen, and certainly the best value-for-money in that regard.The core of a Imperial Squadron is the TIE Fighter.  This ship is very cheap (in points) letting you swarm them quite nicely.I also suggest you buy TWO of the starter sets, so that you get double dice, spare templates, extra cards, and 6 ships to start out with.	22
I saw this movie years ago...forgot the name of it but through the wonders of the internet was finally able to find it again. If you like understated acting and a good story it is as fine a movie as you'll ever see.  Robert Duvall is so good...he just flies right below the radar with his performance and is deeply affecting.  This is an example of incredible storytelling that is often missing in today's hit-you-over-the-head-with-the-plot-and-special-effects movies.	15
Extremely useful especially with my induction cooktop.  Those will not work with aluminum or ceramic pots or pans and the Lodge pans are quite heavy.  But by putting this griddle on the induction cooktop I can use my lightweight aluminum pans and ceramics too.  True, I lose a bit of heat efficiency but not enough to make a difference.  The low lip on this griddle lets me use my pans with handles easily.  I have larger Lodge cast iron pans that will not let me do this.  So for use with induction cooktop this works great for me.	20
I like the sound of this pedal. It gives my ss Fender Princeton chorus a good tubelike sound. I have 2 all tube amps but they are both heavy. I prefer taking the fender ss on smaller gigs. The TO800 gives me the sound I like without breaking the bank. I haven't used batteries in it because I use a 1 spot adapter on all the pedals on my pedalboard. If you'rethinking you want this and are on a tight budget go ahead and pull the trigger. You won't be sorry.	16
My unit is an older model which is called &#34;The Boss&#34; but is the very same as this.  Mine has EXCELLENT suction and I don't mind that it is a little noisy.  Mine is used for cleaning up around the woodstove.  It does an excellent job of sucking up ash and wood particles of various sizes.  I don't understand the negative reviews, unless these people received &#34;lemons&#34;.  I would highly recommend this vac for small jobs, I don't think it was intended to be used for  whole house vacuuming.	13
They just don't write mysteries like Alistair MacLean did anymore. This is one of my all time favorite books. I first read my dad's copy as a teen, and was excited to find this edition, the same as the original I read, on Amazon.The story is gripping and engaging, and the twist at the end (a signature MacLean move which he save literally to the last page... no cheating!) will have you going back and re-reading it just to experience the story with that knowledge!The book was in excellent condition when it arrived - thank you seller.	5
Well, if you're going to spend the money on the Emma movie, this IS the only version to buy.  Gwyneth Paltrow's version does not make the grade, in my opinion. She doesn't fit the part like Kate Beckinsale does. She's got the voice, accent, demeanor, and personality to fit the image of what Jane Austen portrays in her book.  This is the one to buy.  If you want to own this, trust me, rent both versions... you'll see what I mean.	15
I have been using it on my PC for 2 years now. This made-in-China product proved to be very reliable.  It sounds great with games and CD audio.  It sounds A LOT better than those mini 2 speakers. For just $40, I don't see why we should use the cheapy mini speakers.  My only complain is the volume distortion.  If I push the volume higher than 5 using the build-in volume control, the speakers starts to have some background noise.	10
Okay, so I have to admit it.  I own this CD.  I do listen to it from time to time, but that is becoming rare.  The beats were fun and maybe it was just the crazy video for &quot;Around The World&quot; that got me interested.  But enough is enough.  In &quot;Da Funk&quot;, how many times can you hear that one riff before your head explodes or you just have to turn it off?  Give me a break.  They have some good reiffs going, now they just need to get the rest of the songs going.	9
For an inexpensive mask, this does the job for my face, especially when I have a small breakout.  I've been using this for 14 years and hasn't let me down since.  I use it a few times a week to keep the acne down with a minimum time of 20 minutes.  However after removing it, tone (if needed) and moisturize (if necessary) I have recognize it can be somewhat drying, but it's not too bad, in my opinion.  Still the best mask I use for breakouts.	4
I knoew I did not want any holder that took up too much room in my music room, not did I want something that would tip over if I blew air on it. My instructor of the guitar suggested I really read the information about all of the holders and then make my choice of the one that seemed to be light-weight yet sturdy to not fall over, looked professional, and could be the possibility of THE one I would recommend and purchase again. I really like the stability of the one I bought.	16
Works very nice for my Kindle books, but haven't figured out how to (or if it's even possible) to have the computer read it like it did on my Kindle Keyboard.  Doesn't come up often, but I've kind of wished I had it available a couple of times.  That's the only drawback I see.It is very easy to navigate, and easy to put items on or take item off your device.  Actually, it's easier than with my old Kindle!  Easy to download your books from the cloud.  Easy, easy, easy!Love it!	1
Odd little book but very readable.,  Af first I did not think I would like this book but as I read on I really began to like it.It is different but the characters are interesting and it is well written,. I recommend it as a fun quick read. It is not a deep book but the plot is good. I have the sample of the sequel downloaded and intend to read it also.If you are looking for a fun, easy read this would be a book for you.	14
Bought these because I thought they'd be a nice alternative to a plastic or nylon pick for use on my ukulele when I want a different sound than finger picking and strumming can produce.  They give a great tone without hearing the pick strike the string, and they don't wear down the strings and I actually use them on occasion for my 3/4 steel string acoustic guitar when I want a nice mellow tone.  The only negative is that because of being rubber, they &#34;stick&#34; to the strings, so they aren't great for quick strumming, which I wish they were.	16
My baby is breast fed and I needed to start pumping and bottle feeding before heading back to work after 12 wks of maternity leave. Baby would NOT take ANY nipple out there! We tried over 8 different nipples and bottle types. FINALLY this nipple worked! I believe most of it was my prayers asking the Lord to please help this baby take the bottle, but the nipple is the only one that he would take to! Also, amazon is one of the only places I've found that you can actually purchase this nipple! Great buy!	3
I typically like OXO products, and I needed a steel spaghetti server, so I thought I'd give this one a try.  However, I was a little disappointed with this particular utensil when I first received it in the mail, as it's fairly light weight.  At any rate, I've already utilized it a few times now, and it seems rugged enough to do the job, plus it cleans up well in the dishwasher.  The jury is still out on this product though, as I want to see how it holds up over time.	13
These bath wipes are amazing. I cannot get into a bathtub and we are remodeling our shower, so I can't bathe for two weeks. We are one week into the remodeling, and I feel and smell clean. Would I rather be able to take a shower? Of course, I would. But for the next week, that's not in the cards. I am so glad I found these bath wipes. They are thick and super wet, plus they smell good. I would highly recommend them to anyone for any reason.	12
Great little machine. For less than 100 bucks you get a trimmer that does a good job. Can be used as an edger also. I don't have large property but I can use this maybe 3 times before charge runs out. They give you two batteries with it and you can always have the backup charged and ready. Why mess with gasoline and mixing oil. Just turn this on and go. Very light weight and easy to manuever. Can adjust the height to suit your needs and no bumbing to advance the string. More convienent than gas or electric and not alot of money.	18
The Knorr/Lipton Cajun Sides Red Beans and Rice is a yummy dish I could eat it a few times a week... BUT I can eatRice a Roni Red Beans & Rice, 5-Ounce Boxes (Pack of 12)EVERYDAY Y'ALL!!!  Knorr's/Lipton version is milder in flavor cooks faster and can handle an array of customizations like kielbasa, green peppers or sauteed ground beef/turkey and onions while the Rice a Roni version is closest to the homemade flavors in my in-laws recipe and the add-ins need to settle into the original powerful flavors rather than try to enhance them UNLESS it's Tabasco Sauce (Cajun Ketchup).	11
RE; ABRIDGED AUDIO CASSETTE VERSION. Two simulanteous capers from the same protagonist - mission impossible commando raid and avenging vigilante assassin - should not work together in a credible plot structure, but here it does.  Such is Clancy's skill as a storyteller.  Neither should the hardboiled hero's love-at-first-touch fling with a lost girl be sufficient motivation for the events that follow but, again, Clancy makes it work.  My suggestion: sit back and enjoy a master weave suspense from what should be unbelievable circumstances.  Dukes, although not my favorite reader, does good work with this one.	5
I got this for my 2.5 year old son because I remember having so much fun with it when I was a child.  The pictures have gotten much better.  My son is a little young to actually play the game yet, but we have fun finding the different pictures in the pile...plus working on vocabulary.  Whoever designed the pictures, must have toddlers, because they are all pictures they are interested in like pizza, cookies, dinosaurs, puppies, monkeys, etc.  Very durable for carboard.	22
These caplets are fine to swallow and have everything I need in them.  My doctor told me I was low on iron so I've been trying different vitamins with Iron in them.  In these vitamins though is an additive that turns my urine to bright yellow no matter how much water I drink.  I don't care for that.  I went to the doctor to see if I was having a bladder or kidney problem and all is well.  The doctor told me it was the food coloring that they put in them.  Why do that?	12
These bottles have been perfect for us.  We started bottle-feeding out of necessity when our baby was only 6 weeks old, and these bottles have worked perfectly.  They're BPA free, which means we don't have to worry about heating them.  We haven't had any trouble with the nipples, and we're currently using the Stage 2 (3-6 months) size.We love these bottles and their classic design.  And the price is great (BPA-Free plastic bottles often cost $12 each).  If you are bottle-feeding, I would recommend getting at least 12-15 of them so you don't have to wash and sterilize bottles everyday.	3
After using this vehicle tool to remove the fur from the car after my dog's shedding season, I decided to try it at the source of the problem - the shedder.  It turned out she was also looking for a good way to remove that extra fur and cooperated entirely, rotating to all the parts that were shedding.  Ten minutes later both dog and owner were happy with the results.  When asked to comment, the dog rated it more effective than rubbing on the auto upholstry, which has been her preferred method of hair removal until the Mr. Nozzle.	21
I enjoyed this book.  It is not your typical adventure novel, since it takes place in Iowa and Nebraska (not your your typical hot spots of high adventure criminal activity) and the protagonists aren't special operators.  It is a fun read, and I hope Mr. O'Kane makes a series of it.  I'm not going to give you any spoilers, but I would recommend reading it - especially if you get it on a day it is free or you can get it for $0.99.  I love finding gems for those prices.	14
Sorry, old SNL skit with Hanz and Franz. [...] But this air pump gets me as excited as a LITTLE... GIRL... (Sorry again).Seriously, a very good pump that I have been using for a while to pump up a slowly leaking car tire, which takes a LOT of pumping to fill, so you know it's durable.  On suggestion is to tie up the bottom of the hose so that there is not a lot of motion where the rubber meets the steel.  I've found in other pumps that that is always where the failure eventually happens.Great value.	20
Excellent Tipton quality jag set.Brass so you won't have to worry about your barrel if the jag wears through the patch (or catches a corner)Sizes are just right but you have to make sure the patch isn't too large (I find round patches work just the same as the square, as long as you don't have them too big)I think the thread size must be standard for all but the .17 which is the finer thread size.If you catch this set on sale (under thirteen for me) you're getting a great deal.	20
Great acting by actors who seem to relish the limelight.  The intensity of this actor makes me think of a lightning bolt looking for a place to strike.  He's pretty to look at in a dark sexy way, but I really like to see an ensemble cast with multiple plot lines developing each character; I think I get more cluck for my buck.  I get the impression that larger than life character wouldn't permit that somehow; he upstages everybody else to death.  Subsequent episodes might tone him down a bit, but I doubt it.	0
When I bought this piece of garbage, the back of the box said uncut, uncensored version. BULL!!!! The Dutch import version entitled SHADOWS has an additional 25 seconds of footage. Anchor Bay has done this on a number of argento releases, claiming they are uncut and they are not. Quit getting ripped off, buy an all region dvd player and order your movies from overseas distributers. It's the only way to get the movies uncut. Companies like Anchor Bay will continue to lie and rip you off.	15
This was one of Palm's real groundbreaking handhelds, with it's sleek case and low weight.  Still a great handheld but only has 2 MB of memory and lacks the SD slot that the new Palms are being manufactured with.  If you just need a calendar and address book, this will do it, but the m100 will do just about the same (...)(with albeit a much smaller screen).  The backlight on the Palm V is woeful like the backlights on all Palms, but is not needed too often.	10
They don't get jammed in the printer, the labels don't peel off unexpectedly, the sheets do not stick together, so that is all that I ask from labels. One thing that you should consider is the price and how many you'll need.The price for the labels is competitive versus others in the market. While 3000 labels may be too much for the individual user, the number might be just right for an office with a lot of mailings. I am somewhere in between and have found these to be perfectly acceptable.	17
I have other high tend phones but I like Koss so I thought the price was right and bought them. I have to say these are way better than one would think. They live up to the Koss name all I can say. Oh they have a very open clear high end and the mids are full and strong. The bass is defined and not too strong not to over power the rest of the spectrum. The only thing I don't like is the cord is a little too thick and long for my taste.	10
This sharpener is a pocket version of a boxed unit I keep in my shop.  The handle reverses to enclose the dual sharpening surfaces, making it a compact package to carry in your field back, if not in your pocket, as it is a little heavy to cart around in your pocket, in case you are bored and want to sharpen your knife.  But as an addition to your kit, it is ideal, and will keep or restore your knife's edge quickly and effective  Contrary to description, it is 9 inches open and 6 inches closed.	20
If you've never played an RPG before, this one will spoil you rotten. This is where I really started, and I've been trying to find stuff like this one ever since. If you're new at this stuff, but would like to nestle inside of a safe non-threatening experience in the RPG realm, look no further. This is the Cadillac of RPG's. It's easy to play; gives you ample opportunity for increasing your skills, and really touches base with many gaming experiences including fighting, racing, puzzle-solving, strategizing, etc.	23
Peeling and grating ginger is a labor intensive and time consuming process. This product eliminates all that extra time and work. I use it to put in the basket with my loose leaf teas to get a nice ginger tang to my tea and for any other recipe or sauce or salsa or anything else I make that needs a ginger tang. Even great for quick breads and cookies and doesn't have the sugar of candied ginger which many recipes call for. You can replace the sugar with artificial sweeteners if you need the sweetness.	11
I just ordered three different guitar straps online. One for my daughter and at first a cheap one for myself. Then I found this and decided to get it. The $5 strap worked fine but it was scratchy and stiff. I got this and switched over. Ahhh this is a guitar strap! I see why you pay more. It is so soft and comfortable. It looks AMAZING! This is just a great product. I would highly recommend it to anyone and am proud to use it on my guitar. Thanks!	16
I have nothing to add to the reviews of those who have found this a superlative, moving 'gesamtkunstwerk'.  All four soloists are excellent, as is the orchestra and dramatic interpretation of what is, after all, an oratorio.I have just found out that Lorraine Hunt Lieberson died of cancer on July 3, 2006.  A life all too short!  Her performance in this production shows just what was lost with her passing.  This is yet another reason to obtain it and witness for yourselves.	6
I read the online help & everything.  Honestly, this app did nothing for me.  I saw some pretty graphs but that was it.  I saw that my signal is the strongest.  If that is what this app is form fine but other reviews made this out to be a way to boost your signal & I never saw anything like that.  Like I said, I saw some graphs & my signal is strongest.  Not worth my time to download this, even with it taking less than 10 seconds.	1
The title description speaks for itself.I won't bore you with a song by song review because all the songs are amazing from the beginning to end...Classic sound with a modern twist.Rush is that one band that will never disappoint.They remain one of my fave bands ever,if not favorite and I'm sure they will still put out albums after this release.If you're a Rush fan pretty much from the beginning,this is for you.You won't take the disc out of your player.Yes,I still buy cd's and will until they are not made anymore  Rock n roll!!!!  \m/	6
I own one of these amps and it is capable of everything from very clean to heavy over-drive. I love it. It's got tone galore! I play either a Martin A/E thru it or a Strat knock-off.  Either one sounds awesome.  Never dreamed of such an enjoyable little amp, let alone for $20. Battery life seems OK, but I hate messing with batteries, so I'd buy power supply (you can get a 9V supply (check for proper polarity) at the Thrift store for a buck).  Don't even think about it.  Get it.  $20 is pocket change.	16
This story line captivated me from the first chapter.  It had ALOT of swearing and graphic sexual content which I didn't enjoy having to wade through and skip over.  I didn't think it added anything to the storyline, and felt that it could have been left out all together.I found the author commentaries at the end to be most fascinating.  It was interesting to read that the story line has some non-fiction events weaved into it.  I you don't mind filthy language and sexual content this is a great read.	5
Answer Manmanages to be both philosophically deep and lightheartedly funny at the same time. If you want to see a romantic comedy,Answer Manworks well. It has some funny scenes (including Jeff Daniels' monster collection) and the usual awkward romance. However, if you also like pondering the BIG questions,Answer Manprovides some interesting food for thought. It doesn't so much provide any meaningful answers as to suggest where to look for questions. Perhaps most important question is whether our lives are shaped by our choices or events that happen to us - or both.	0
they expose a nerve with this one!most rappers shout-out god in they credits, but few touch on somethin spiritual in their actual lyrics...outkast aint nowhere near saints, but you can feel the spiritual searchin in the undertones of what they are sayin...soul searchin is what hip-hop needs more of.  that's what sets this release from other hip-hop classics; these boys are always lookin to grow beyond not just where they at, but from where they might be tomorrow....but yall proly aint feelin me on that, so i'll just say this:&quot;me anyuuu  yomama an yocuz zin toooooooooo......&quot;	9
Without a doubt the best of the best. There are so many features that makes this saw the best.  There is not another saw that even comes close.  it runs smooth.  cuts aggressive (when aggresion is needed) as well as runs straight and true when fine detail is needed.  i do a wide aray of things with mine.  including ripping.  Try one out and compare it to other saws, you will agree.  There is only one jigsaw in my opinion.  the rest are just up and down vibrators.	21
The app has been updated and now it works correctly on the Xoom.ORIGINAL REVIEW:This app sort of works with the front-facing camera on the Motorola Xoom.  The preview doesn't work right, everything looks all stretched and distorted, but when it actually takes the pictures, the result looks normal.I suppose the $2 cost of the app is less then what a set of photos from a real photobooth would cost, but this app doesn't seem to have much use beyond its single, kitchy purpose.	1
Although the cartridges look like genuine Canon, they did not come in the Canon packaging shown in the illustration---which I find worrisome.The price I paid ($27) I paid is the price of fresh genuine virgin Canon, not the price of a cheap refills, OEM, 3rd-party cartridges, counterfit cartridges, or out-of-date repackaged cartridges.Amazon promptly offered a full refund (if I ship the cartridges back), but that really doesn't solve the issue.I suggest contacting the seller and asking for assurance that the product is fresh virgin original Canon cartridges in original Canon packaging before purchasing.	17
These pants are great. Color is true and doesn't run in the wash. They are roomy and fit comfortably. I haven't the need to wear a size larger as some other reviewers have mentioned. They fit as they should. Inseam fits true as well. The cargo pockets are generously sized and good for carrying pretty much anything. I find that it is easier to work in these pants than jeans, especially in warmer weather, due to the lighter weight and better range of motion that they allow. I would definitely buy another pair.	8
I have tried every bra out there from cheap to very expensive.. If you need support and a decent looking bra, this is the bra for you. I am a 50 year old large busted woman who needs support in a bra. I have been professionally fitted and spent $100's of dollars on bras and always kick myself and go back to Bali..After almost 40 years I will not bother with any other bra again. Now I just order a new set of all colors about every 6 months....it can't be beat..	8
As stated this is a Sony product in the original package.  It appears well made and charges my Sony P1i phone.  It actually has 2 lights.  The first is a ready light on the 12 V plug end that indicates the charger is plugged into the adapter in your auto (it does not hurt the battery of my vehicle to keep this plugged in all the time).  The second light is on the other end (that attaches to your Sony phone) and can be turned on or off.  It is fairly bright and can be used as a flashlight.	7
"Flyleaf shows why they have consistency on the Billboard Album chart. Every song shows a passion that Lacey and the others have for the music. My favorites are ""All Around Me"" and ""Cassie"". I really love the acoustic version of ""Cassie"". Flyleaf displays their musical prowess by supplying acoustic versions of ""Fully Alive"", ""Red Sam"", ""Cassie"", ""I'm so sick"", and ""All around me"". If you haven't picked up this CD, pick it up. It is worth the money."	6
I tried the chintzy cover that came with the Palm V, but it does not offer enough protection.  Then I tried the &quot;slim&quot; leather case from 3Com, and it's OK, but bulky, and the strap that closes it is inconvenient.  Finally managed to find the hard case at CompUSA, and like it the best.  OK, it's not perfect.... you do have to remove the V or put it on a book in  order to HotSync, but so what?  For my money, the hard case is the way to  go.	10
This products works! I don't have skin problems, but I was looking for something to keep my skin fresh. I use it about 3 times a week, and each time I feel very refreshed. I've used this product for a few months. Unless you're using a gallon each time, this product should last for a while.Pros:- Refreshing- scrub cleans the skin without being overly abrasive- Smells niceCons:- none that I can think ofOverall: 5/5. This is a quality product that really keeps the skin fresh.	12
I'm a prime member so the price was good when I was buying supplies and I got the two day shipping along with it.  They certainly erase even on my sketch pad quite nicely.  I suppose some do in fact smudge and make a mess of your paper, however, I don't get a big smudge mess that has me throwing paper away.  And what can I say I hate the shedding all over the place but what eraser doesn't leave a trail of pink flecks behind.  Overall good experience with purchase so 5 stars.	17
This cable was received neatly coiled with twist-ties in a retail package. The connectors, which are already applied, will not loosen over time like manually pinned out cables will have a special design to protect the security clip from breaking off. This allows the RJ45 connectors to fit firmly in place and not fall out of the network port.Belkin is a recognized brand for premium cables. Even though this is a name brand cable, the price was comparable to other similar cables making this purchase a clear best choice.	10
Had zero effect. My windows must already allow enough signal through for this to not make a difference. Bought it for the back of my place because I get full bars right outside on the patio, and almost none inside (I live in a concrete apartment). If I put the phone in the same place I had this, I get good reception, but this didn't extend my signal any, or act as a repeater. Didn't seem to help in the car either, but I don't really need it there.	7
Lots of reviewers have commented about how it took them minutes to sift a single cup of flour. I sifted 3 cups worth in about 15 seconds, and I wasn't shaking it excessively either. The sifting action works well, and I did not have any problems with flour going all over or needing to use a super large bowl to catch it all. Honestly, I don't know if the other reviewers got a bad item, or if they were trying to sift a coarsely ground material, but it works fine.	13
Tough, long-lasting, rigid - I use these to divide garden plants like irises and trolius right in the planter, to take out stumps by cutting through the roots buried in the ground, and for limbing - replaces the chain saw for all but tree trunk cutting and where too far from house to get an extension cord. Can also be bent back straight in a vise several times without breaking, and resharpened easily with a dremel tool with abrasive cutoff blade after cutting roots in the ground. My neighbors love them - I think they have used them more than I have.	21
"Proofreading issues aside.  Bob Moats' Classmates Murder draws you in with interesting characters who are believable and likeable.  His stories are romantic and compelling without the ""lust and thrust"" and foul language so often forced on the reader by many authors.  I did not intend to get caught up in this series, but by the end of Classmate's Murders I was curious how the characters would continue to develop.  I eagerly looked forward to each book in the series and watching the author ripen with each new book.  I think I see a Best Selling Author in the making!"	14
"What a way to start the weekend!  Sexy Gage struts his ""stuff"" for the girls to see.  Little did we know he was hoping Hailey would catch the show and fall for him.  He is a brave man to show it off just to get his girl.Hailey is so sweet.  I was glad to see a curvy woman be the center of attention. Lots of yummy sexy encounters while they work out their issues.Hailey and Gage figure it out with the help of family and friends, just the way it should be.Can't wait until the next brothers installment."	14
I had more USB adapters then I knew what to do with.  Enter the cyberpower 7 port hub... I am very pleased with it.  I'm not a techy, just an every day computer user.  I use my hub with my iMAC and it works seamlessly, have had no issues.  I bought another for a friend and she is pleased as well.  Like I said, it does what it says it will do with little effort, and works quite well for the technically challenged.	7
"First, they change the product.  The packaging AND the pad.Grandma's comments...""What did they do?  They made it thinner and shorter!! It does not hold my pee anymore!Why do they always change something that works and make it not work? These really stink now.I don't want you to spend the little money I have left on this crap. Please find me something new that works!""This was when they were $10.99 for 30 overnight pads.  Now they are $28.00!!!!!Are they crazy??? Do these people know the limited finances seniors are on??"	12
I have 3 cats. One poohs and pees, then immediately jumps out of the litter box, creating a HUGE mess for me to clean up all the time! She's just crazy!I have bought more than 5 different types of Litter Mats, and this one is THE BEST so far.My boyfriend has litter duty, so he placed the litter mat, directly in front of the litter box - at the middle Horizontally.It works so good, I haven't had to clean litter up off my hard wood floor in a few days now.I LOVE IT!!!!Try it!	19
"This album is universally regarded as the Beach Boys' masterpiece, and who am I to disagree?  You might say that this was the band's peak, but I would say that they actually peaked with the ""Good Vibrations"" single after this.  But Pet Sounds is certainly their peak from an album standpoint.  This album always ranks among the top ten albums of all time in any survey of critics, and rightly so.  If you can't appreciate how great this album is, I feel sorry for you."	9
All right, I did not time the recording to make sure I actually got 45 minutes on each side, but the tape snapped into place securely, and I recorded from one end to the other without it tangling inside the recorder. When I played it back, it played back smoothly with no skips or tangles. I have used three or four of them without a hitch, but then I generally do rely on Maxell for my taping needs so I was not surprised. I will buy more again when I need more.	10
After buying the Camp Chef SG90 Deluxe steel fry griddle, it took me much longer than I thought to find the associated carrying bag. The item description didn't say what size griddle it fit and there was another review that said the bag didn't fit right. I have a the Camp Chef SG90 2-burner steel griddle and this bag fits it perfectly with enough extra space that it'll fit thicker griddles too. After paying almost $90 for the griddle I can't see storing or transporting it without protecting it, and this bag does exactly that.	20
I received this little gem for Christmas and now I refuse to speak into the phone itself.  This BT enabled unit is the perfect gift for anyone with a cell phone.No more complicated setups.  As soon as I turned this on, my Nokia found it, recognized it, associated it, and I was speaking into it.The battery life is great and the clarity is also dead on.Once you use this product, you too will never go back to speaking into your phone the old fashioned way.	7
This level is a good level but it is not a 40 dollar level. I guess I'll have to buy a Swanson level, Swanson's torpedo is the exact same level that Klein sells (Klein buys it and slaps their name on it just like they do with most of their other tools) it costs 25 bucks it has neodymium magnets, bigger vials and it has and is machined from solid aluminum just like the Checkpoint. I've had many Checkpoints and I like them but they aren't worth the money.	21
"Str8te Boys was a fun read.  It wasn't ground-breaking or something I'll remember for the rest of my days, but it was emotionally satisfying and just the kind of story I was looking for!Both the main characters are into sports, so being gay isn't something they feel they can be out about... even with each other.  As best friends and roomies, they spend a lot of time together and their games of ""gay chicken"" really made me laugh.I think this would be a great beach read or just a sweet romantic quickie to tide you over, especially if you have a male/male craving.  *wink*"	14
I am profuse back sweater and had been using Sweatblock pads with great relief.  However, I wanted to find something easier to apply at less cost.  I assumed since the ingredients were the same that Certain Dri would do the trick.  And it has lots of great reviews.  It's been somewhat of a disappointment.  While I can tell it does prevent some sweating, it doesn't keep me dry to the same extent Sweat block did.  I'll try it a little longer because of the price, but it doesn't do the trick as I had hoped.	12
There isn't much to these clamps and thats what makes them so darn useful.It seems like the race is on to see who can build a better clamp. Perhaps pipe clamps are like the mouse trap so called improvements have been made. But are they really better? granted there are some nice clamps out there but dont overlook the simplicity of the jorgenson.It's tried true and timeless not to mention very inexpensive.I choose to use galvenized pipe instead of black it tends to be cheaper and wont rust up and stain your project.Now get out there and clamp something.	21
These may cost a bit more but they last and save time not to mention money.  Use them to remove material that has not been coated with any type of VOC poly or paint and they will outlast other types of belts.  They are too good to use in a situation where heat and goo will clog the grit .  Better to use a cheap belt first then go to these for efficient quality removal.  Clean the belt often with a belt cleaner especially if you think it is getting so hot that it is melting the finish instead of abrading it.	21
"Like its big brother, this is an excellent quality rake. The 8"" shrub rake is durable and has a comfortable handle.Great for getting into tight spots around your landscaping.The head and tines are flexible and durable.I have had this rake for a few years and it is still in mint condition even after a lot of use. I have had small shrub rakes that have too stiff a tine and end up with broken tines.These are flexible and strong.A very nice item.Highly recommended."	18
I just got this machine and made the strawberry ice cream recipe that came with it.  Ben and Jerry, eat your heart out.  This is so easy there's no reason to ever eat store bought ice cream again.  No locust bean gum, no artificial color, no preservatives - and you can make it with organic ingredients if you want.  The ice cream tastes awesome, and I would recommend this machine to anyone, especially those who cannot use a hand crank machine, or don't want the fuss and muss of using salt.	13
After several love affairs with other well-known lip balms, I wanted something that was actually moisturizing my lips instead of making me feel like I needed to constantly re-apply.  This lip moisturizer is unscented, does not make your lips tingle, is long lasting, and is great on its own or under lipstick. My lips no longer crave lip balm, nor do they have dry spots or cracks.  This is now my go-to balm and I have to buy it in multiples to ensure I have them in my bag, in my car, at work, at my bedside, all over.	4
"I recently bought a ""juice pack"" for my iPhone 4, and it takes the micro A USB cord. They are not too common, and the cord furnished with the battery pack is extremely short. The Nokia CA-101 was a better length, and it was in the PRIME area.Pros:Syncs with iTunes on the iMacGreat companion in the carSolid construction; not cheaply madeCons:Cord will slip out of the juice pack battery with no-noticeNever have enoughStrong, and long enough to use in case of a zombie attackhighly recommend"	7
The product's good, so I set up an Subscribe & Save for ir, as well as the Regenerist Eye. But it seems that every time I add some other item to my cart, I get a message telling me that the price of these two items has INCREASED since I put them in my cart (on Subscribe & Save).  Today it's already happened... TWICE!  There may be subscribing going on, but the saving part is dwindling to the point that I'm prepared to CANCEL my S&S with Amazon, and just buy it at Costco!	4
"I was given this book to borrow -- ""It is just a wonderful book."" I cannot stand mediocre writing, and for this reason I don't often read popular fiction. I pushed into it, however, hoping for the best. Just could never care at all about the characters. The old guy is grumpy and resentful. Some of the circus behind-the-scenes reporting is interesting, but much of that is pretty low-life and tawdry. Not for me. I will read the ending and report back to my friend, but I will not read the rest of it."	5
"The price makes this set an excellent value. The chisels come ""sharpened"" but they are not ready for use.  Spend some time  flattening the back and put a really sharp edge on these chisels.  Substantial machine marks are present on the backs of these chisels and you'll need to spend a fair bit of time flattening the back. After that, it is smooth sailing. The chisels come with plastic edge protectors so the box is superfluous. But I kept it anyway to help organize my drawer. Also, the handles are surprisingly comfortable."	21
I purchased this battery for a premium as it boldly proclaimed &#34;Li-Ion&#34;.  That purchase was before I noted that all of the other, more inexpensive batteries were also Li-Ion types, and also OEM.  My fault for not paying attention.  Be advised there are better prices for this exact item on Amazon, so please keep looking.This having been said, the item was shipped quickly, and arrived so fast that I almost had to duck.  I therefore have no issues with the seller, who is doing a good job.	7
Man this is one great blues guitar album! It may be listed under Albert Collins, but this is a true collaboration. Robert Cray really shines here and is much bluesier then you will find him on his own albums. All three share in the vocal duties and the guitar solos.  No one plays over each other - it's a great collaboration that results in a great album.  Just listen to the first cut and you will get a good taste of what is in store.  Buy it and enjoy.	9
I've held off on buying this for a long time because I had a hard time parting with $30 for a plastic bowl. I'm so glad I purchased it finally. As you would expect from OXO, it's very well made. OXO always has the best products--definitely the best value. The top handle makes the bowl spin fast so the lettuce dries in no time. It even has a little break to stop the bowl from spinning. The large bowl is the perfect size for a bag of lettuce.	13
I remember playing the free version of this a long time ago. I wound up uninstalling it because I hate ads and I wouldn't pay more than 99c for it.It's scrabble solitaire. It's very good at being exactly what you expect it to be. The UI could use a facelift, and is a bit cluttered.Glad I got it for free, it will stay on my phone. Especially since the dev gets it... even weighing in at under 800KB it still moves to the SD card. My OCD thanks you.	1
This movie does have entertainment value, and it is affordable enough to entertain some friends at home on a rainy day.  The video is grainy, almost 16mm like in appearance.  The music and sound effects during the fights scenes reminds me of the 60's campy hooded crimefighter shows. ZAP!  BOOM!  POW!  Holy Low budget Cinema! is what Jack Nicholsons trusty sidekick would say if he had one.  There is a story and it is ok.  Buy it for your collection, otherwise pass.	15
It was a awful lot of flashback in the in this first episode; I almost gave up seriouly. It got me to thinking is this a apocalypse or what? So for the most part it started out pretty slow. I'm all for post apocalypse movies, or especially something; I can believe that would actually take place no matter if it's super natural or not. But, I can see why this show didn't get picked up for it's next season to many flashbacks the 2nd episode same thing.	0
I am mid 30's and just got into wet shaving. I read reviews about this and knew what I was getting into. I thought this stuff would smell more old man'ish than it does. It actually smells pretty great. The smell does stick around for a while. I can smell this stuff on my hands AFTER a couple of washes. So if you want something that dies down quick this may not be the best thing for you. Since I love the smell I just stopped wearing cologne and I just rock out with this instead.	12
Billy Ocean was one the most pleasant and emblematic figures of the pop movement between the early seventies. His repertoire was composed by easy to listen ballads and swinging pieces that were influence by the rhythm & soul. He is visibly influenced by Marvin Gaye, Lou Rawls and a little bit of Barry White. He was owner of a natural sympathy and unique charisma that so many successful moments gave us along his career.This compilation confirms why he was the figure he was. Don't miss this important album, part of the musical history.	9
This is my favorite vanilla for baking, by far!!! I love that it is not a thin liquid but more of a thick, syrup consistency, so when added to anything you are baking (especially in quantities that are over and above the quantity called for in a recipe, which is a must for me) it does not alter the end product the way traditional thin vanilla extract does. In addition, like all Nielsen-Massey vanilla products, it has a robust vanilla flavor. Accept no cheap substitute. This is worth the price; your taste buds will thank you.	11
This is my new best friend. This thing is awesome.The Quartet Ultima easel is adjustable. I can adjust it to whatever setting I need . It even can be used as a table top but I don't use it that way.  It is easy to move. We have dragged this all over the house and out to the barn to list the days work or anything else. It is so stable, we used it on a float in a parade. It wipes of easily. And the frame seems like it is going to last.I am very pleased	17
I am anti-gadgets having discovered in the past I use them once or twice, and then I forget I have them or they don't work very well, and end up taking up valuable space.After rave reviews, I finally caved and bought the salad spinner.  This is a FABULOUS kitchen tool.  It really spins the salad leaves well with minimal effort.  I now use it every time I have salad. NO MORE WET SALAD!In addition, there are multiple uses with the bowl.  Serve your salad in it, store your salad in it, etc.	13
Wonderful stories from a child's perspective. I like how Little Bill has supportive relationships with children and adults. Little Bill has a good friend who happens to have Cerebral Palsy and is wheelchair bound. The stories deal openly and compassionately with common issues that arise around those with special needs (helping vs. making someone feel babied). Adults (teacher, parents, grandparents) are depicted as helpful and wise allies. There are episodes that show sibling rivalry, competitiveness, and ways they resolve hurt feelings. The voice of Little Bill does remind me of Bill Cosby's standup and mention of his own childhood.	0
I use to purchase Docker's all the time because of the quality, recent purchases of Docker pants have shown that the company is greedy, charging a high price for a poor quality item.  I decided to make a switch and try some IZOD pants.These pants fit perfect for me, the quality of the material is what Dockers used to be and at a much lower cost to me.A three way win.No more button popping, no more inaccurate lengths in their sizing chart (Dockers), no more thin easy rip issues.	8
I've had it for almost 3 years now.. not a single problem! I've changed my setup like crazy, sometimes even the cables had to be twisted in some certain position on a pedalboard. Been bent on the edge of the cable right before the connector, been pulled (normal way) and stomped, never a single cut offs on the connection.Don't worry too much about cables like a sissy bedroom princess guitarists, you're using od/distortion pedals anyway right? If you're a purist, don't ever use a pedals or even electric guitar. Good luck!	16
Purchased this aerosol can when I was about to renovate a couple of corroding, outdoor light fixtures.  After completely taking the light fixtures apart, and using a bit of elbow grease with a wire brush, cleaned the parts, we applied the Permatex Rust Treatment.  Lo and behold, the rust disappeared and a black coating emerged.  Afterwards, we applied a coat of U-POL ACID #8 Etch Primer and two finishing coats of Rust-Oleum, turning the aging light fixtures in brand new ones.	2
GREAT sander, does the job wonderfully, rugged (I've dropped it _so_ many times...), but there's a BUT: the vibration causes my right arm to go numb. Vibrates my funnybone somehow, and the numbness takes days to go away. Maybe it's just me, or maybe that's just something this type of sander does, but as much as I use it, I HATE to use it for that reason.Oh, also, be careful of the skitter. Good technique required.	21
This is not one of those compact designer USB car charger things - but I like it and it does a good job. It feels nice - not like cheep plastic.It takes my iPhone 4S and my Jawbone Bluetooth device at the same time and charges them just as you would expect.The reviews on some of the compact designs did not fill me with confidence. I would prefer it to be smaller - but I would rather it was reliable.If the reliability changes I will update the review. So far so good.	7
Virtua Fighter may have a hard time competing with games such as DOA2, or tekken tag, but believe me this was what paved the way for those games.  All though it lacks where the others seem to excell with story modes and hidden characters, virtua fighter makes up with character variety and a great display of styles (drunken style, mantis, sumo, etc.).  I was shocked at how fun this game was even after playing more modern games.  Even with new games on the market, I think i'll be playing this one for a while.  The teacher of fighting games.	23
Ben Carson was more then just a gifted surgeon, but a man who had drive and ambition within him that he did not even know he had.  His mother was a great influence in his life and it shows in this movie about Ben Carson's life.  If you really want to know what drives a man then you need to get the movie.  You will learn that what he said at the National Prayers Breakfast was real and that is why the media has since launched a campaign to keep him from advancing his philosophy on life.	15
I'm not sure what to make of all of the negative reviews on this thing - it works fine for me in charging an iPod as well as my wife's iPad (I know, the Kindle enthusiast has an iPad in the family - don't tell anyone).  There realy isn't too much you can say in a review for a product like this - it either works as advertised or it does not, and in this case it does.  For this price, it certainly beats purchasing an Apple-branded charger!	7
I bought these to help with leaks during engorgement after giving birth. My nipples were raw, sore and a little bloody. Even though I coated my nipples with lanolin after every feeding the pads would still stick to my nipples.  My breasts and nipples already hurt so to have to peel these pads off every two hours was torture.  To make things worse little strands of cotton would dry themselves onto the cracked bleeding parts. Ouch! I found the smooth, cool lycra of my bras was better. A waste of money!	3
Capcom continues to make great fighting games, but this time out with Power Stone they create something special.  Power Stone was one of the first Dreamcast games out for the Dreamcast and helped make the system worth buying.  You can go anywhere, grab anything, and then beat the hell out of your opponent.  Its a great game, the only problem is that there is so much going on during the game you can lose your concentration at times, but thats the only flaw.  Otherwise, its a great game.	23
When I got the tool, the fence was not alligned with the blade.  The slots on material would not line up parallel, and did not fit well.  The fence is attached with two screws, and is movable.  Other machines (I also have a Makita) use a design with two machined, parallel surfaces, and this is not a problem.  With the Dewalt, it is.  After aligning the fence, the machine works, but out of the factory, it was not even close.	21
the batter died and then yo uahve to buy and solder a new one in there.  REALLY!  or thow it out and buy a new one for 200.they say they dont make the CS70N anylonger so you have to buy a whole new unit.  Terrible design.im on the phone a good part of the day and should have known better to not buy a more expensive unit.do yourself a favor and call the manufacturer first and ask about stuff like battery life, how to replace.  I would have not purchased this if I had know it woudl last only a year or two.	7
Cruisin with power tools.  One can never have enough.  Forgot about how important it was to control the dust(MDF) stands for &quot;man-made dust factory&quot;.  Although I could have used a larger unit, I can only use one machine at a time.  It has got to be better than a shop vac.  It is definitely a whole lot queiter.  Static pressure is lower but volume is tremendously greater.  I might be able to find what is left of my basement yet! If you love wood, than get one of these before you change your mind because of the dust.	21
"It would appear that there's no room for any more sci-fi on television! Really. ""V"" and ""The Event"" are gone. All that's left now is ""Fringe"" and now ""Falling Skies""! Falling Skies may not even get a second season let alone a complete first season. We'll see. Same for the comming ""Battlestar Galactica: Blood & Chrome"".Sci-fi is going the way of veriety shows(extinction) and soon no network will even bother putting out a science fiction product. Not unless we pay for it ""directly""!"	0
I had trouble with strings going out of tune too often. Installed these Fender locking tuners, and voila !!!!!Amazing difference !!! Re-stringing is much faster now, and tuning is fast (no long loops around the tuning pegs) ,holds up much longer, rarely need to re-tune now, even after lots of bending and vibrato. ( I love the Ernie Ball Super Slinky 9-42 strings and Fender stainless steel 9-42 strings also).My opinion is every Strat benefits from these tuners, they should be standard on both the MIM's and American Strats.	16
I purchased this as a storage container for my dry dog food. Unfortunately, when I removed it from the box, one of the wheels was already broken and the exterior of the container was scratched like it had been used for months prior to its arrival. I honestly would have been ok with the scratches but I had to send it back because I could not fix the wheel. I was apprehensive about buying another one online, so I didn't and instead I chose buy a different one from one of the big box stores in our area.	19
"To get straight to the point, Comatose is probably Skillet's best album ever. Without hearing anything on this record before buying it, I was completely convinced that there was no way Comatose could come close to comparing to ""Collide"" ~ which I thought was even better than the outstanding record ""Alien Youth."" Comatose is packed from start to finish with songs you probably won't ever skip. The tracks just rock my face off. I would rate this album 6 stars if I could. Its that good."	6
I bought the Nook primarily for reading but wanted the HD for email and web browsing also. I was pleasantly surprised at the exceptional screen quality and ease of setup.I did not want to spend the money for an IPAD and now I am glad I didn't as I prefer the Nook interface for reading. The screen brightness can be changed anytime during reading but on the IPAD you have to go into settings after exiting the book you are reading. The only downside is there are not as many apps written for the Nook. I am hoping that will change.	10
You may wat to reconsider buying ANY filter.On this model, the top (filter) part is essentially pantyhose wrapped around a cardboard tube.Despite this, the clamp and adjuster parts are relatively good.In all honesty, Buy a nicer filter, or none at all. They do NOT make a huge difference on recording quality unless you're using Top-of-the-line microphones. If this is the case, spend the money to get a nicer filter.One nice thing- these keep artists from getting too close to the mic and essentially making out with them. I found that quality nice when dealing with... passionate vocalists.	16
If you are in the business,  then you know what a pain it is to set up your dewalt miter saw for punching out apartmenst or any area for second trim (shoe molding or scribe molding). This tool is the one for that job.  I have owned three of them.  of course it will not do what a top grade miter saw will do.  but it is not suppose to. it also works great for thresholds and for trimming doors for flooring.  i am in the fire and water restoration business and i believe you will find this tool very helpful.	21
I bought this for my Weber Genesis Silver.  It fit perfectly over the grill.  Two things I really liked about this cover.  First, there were no vents like my old Weber cover.  Basically the vents defeated the purpose of a cover.  Dust would get in - especially during our dust storms out here in AZ.  Second, it's heavy and has an internal liner.  This keeps the bottom of the grill from flapping up and getting dust in that way.This is even cheaper than the Weber cover.	18
I purchased this DVD set, not on Amazon (I should have since it's cheaper!), but in the stores.  This is a great period drama set in Africa.  Trevor Eve stars and does a superb job as Lt. Tyburn.  Susannah Harker (who starred as Jane in the BBC's Pride and Prejudice) is his love interest and she plays a great role.  There are three episodes (somewhat long, as they were aired in the MYSTERY! series on PBS) that show Lt. Tyburn's removal from Scotland Yard to the outback of Africa, and the scenery and acting by the entire cast make this show a must-see.	15
I actually like this case a lot. I was worried about the price and it being a TPU and all. I have to say, I have a feeling this one is going to last a lot longer than the Spigen Neo-Hybrid I owned for 3 months before it broke. And even better, I can fit all of my charging and headphone devices perfectly, unlike the Spigen. It doesn't make the case bulky, as it may look. It actually feels quite nice in my hands. Overall, I really like this case. If that happens to change eventually, I will absolutely re-review it!	7
After drying my black car a few times with this towel, it performs no better than any other towel I've ever used. Sure, it holds a lot of water but that is part of the problem. It doesn't easily wring out so after just a few swipes it is completely saturated with water. Anything that I dry with it after it becomes wet leaves huge water streak marks behind unless I follow up with another dry towel. My best results have been a traditional chamois that is easy to wring and doesn't leave streaks behind after the first pass.	2
My 4 and 10 year old both enjoy this game as well as my husband and myself.  Some children's games are just not enjoyable for adults but this one is more fun than many.  Easy rules.  The hardest part for young children to learn is which peple to flip down after you ask a question.  This game uses process of elimination and grouping like features such as facial hair, glasses, female/male, hair color, hat, and eye color.  Overall a fun game!  I like that there are people of light and dark skin but would be nice to show people of different cultures.	22
There is a reason that this book has so many 5 star reviews...I avoided reading this for a while because I didn't think that I'd be interested in novel set in a circus during the depression, but I finally picked it up after yet another person told me how good it was.  I'm so glad that I did!  It really is the best thing that I've read in a long time.  I quickly became engrossed and could not put it down.  Do yourself a favor and give it a try, you will not be disappointed. Oh, and I LOVED the ending!	5
I thought I need to change the nipples since my baby is already 100 days old :P. But after trying size 3 for four times, I'm certain that this size is too big for him. Yes, he drinks really really fast by using size 3, but he dripped three times more than when he's using size 2 nipples. So I switched back to size 2 for now. Don't get me wrong, I like Avent nipples and I'm sure size 3 will work just as well as size 2 in the future, but perhaps it shouldn't be labeled as 3 mo+.....	3
Strawberry is definately there. There's definately a ton of vitamin flavor in here also. The first taste, well, chalk comes to mind. Then bitter. Then sweet. Then strawberry. A little bit of dairy. Then, well I really needed to clear my mouth with something else.Smoothie flavor.... not a chance. It's stiff, sticky, chewy, and sickeningly sweet.How does it compare to those nasty marzipan bitter vitaminie energy bars? Well this one is just vaguely tolerable compared to those.Sorry, I'm afraid I'd rather go hungry.	12
My daughter is 3.5 years old and I have been looking for a large enough sturdy bathtub for her.This one is just perfect in every aspect.It is large and deep enough for a toddler and very comfortable and stylish.My daughter is thrilled with it and loves her bathtime in her new Primo Euro Bath.It is easy enough to empty out the water and it fits perfectly in a standard bathtub.Definately a good buy.I would not reccomend it to parents of a newborn or a small baby.This is more of a second baby bathtub.	3
"Now I know why the cheap potty seats are so cheap. Wish I has been able to see this side-by-side with the cheap ones. If I had this would have been the one I would have bought. This potty seat is well designed, doesn't rock, and is one piece. It's adjustable and easily fits the toilet at my son's house and the one at my house. My granddaughter wouldn't sit one the ""cheap"" one bought originally but really likes this one. Dry days are coming soon, wish they had these when my kids were at this stage."	3
I have been reading all of Delle Jacobs' books this month, and this is one of my favorites. I recognize I really like her more comical plots than the more serious ones, and part of the allure is her wonderful wit and wonderful characterizations. But this is also a truly very sweet love story as well, and very beautifully told. Not a dull moment in the entire book. Some explicit sex, but some of it is even....funny. Yes, funny!This is one I will definitely re-read and pass along to friends. I highly recommend it!	14
"Gibran was a great author and in this book he truly shines. I recommend this book to anyone, even if he/she is not into reading. The book is short but full of wisdom. I only gave it 4 stars because the idea of the book (and even the title) are taken from ""Thus Spoke Zarathustra"" which I gave 5 stars. So I didnt think it would be fair to give this one an equal grading. I actually recommend both books, but The Prophet is much easier to read, while Thus Spoke Zarathustra is deeper and more intelligent."	5
"Great for looking around at Wifi networks, their security levels, channels, strength.Great for walking around your home and determining who's nearby home is interfering with your network, and on what channel you can best set your router.Great for finding dead zones at work, or anywhere.With the optional Connector Library, you can click on a net and connect.There are many tools like this, surely, but this one's simplicity and ease of use (we call that ""usability"" in the biz) put it ahead of the rest."	1
Like some of the other reveiwers, I saw this first when I was young and loved it. Every once in a while I would catch it halfway over on TBS and always stopped what I was doing to watch it. I can't give it 5 stars but it  is a great horror movie, with plenty of scary music (the Dies Irae from the  requiem mass, mostly) and creepy shots of the Car's front tire rolling over  body parts and french horns. When the Car kill's Brolin's girlfriend is by  far the scariest part of the movie. If I heard that horn right now...	15
At less than a dollar per sheet, you can afford to treat them as disposable and not be too upset if they fall off or lose their ability to stay on that long. What sells the screen protectors for me is that they come with a grid on the backing so you can easily measure and quickly cut to match the size of the LCD you're protecting. If you want something more permanent, then go with Invisible Shield or Best Skins Ever. But for the price and their versatility, they're well worth it.	7
If you have heard of Stevie Ray Vaughan, Eric Johnson, Walter Trout, Johnny Lang or Joe Kubek; Ask where does their music come from? Most probably the answer is: Freddie King; Burglar.In this album, Freddie sets the standards of any guitar used in a blues or a rock song.A 1972 release, shortly before his death, this album will blow your mind and ears away. No other blues album of its generation comes close; and this is nothing like Fredddie's previous releases.I believe that Freddie King ranks in Blues the same as Miles Davis in Jazz. Too bad he died too soon.Highly recommended.	9
If the cord was 1 foot longer, 5 stars.  I don't get it.  Is someone saving 2 cents for every one of these?  Or..  make the earpiece cord shorter and the thicker part longer.  Would have been great if it came with a removable ear clip/wire but not really complaining about that.  Maybe a future feature.  Then again, if they can't make the cord 1 foot longer, I wouldn't expect any other luxuries.  Functionally seems fine.	10
I have read four of the six books and I have no complaints. I love, love, love, love the sappy love stories and Brenda Jackson capture my interest every time. I like the way she sets up the story line of a person not looking for love and then can't help but fall in love. The stories  for me are truly what love should be like. Every character we can relate to in some type of way.Also, I love series of family and friends. Keep up the good work!!!	14
Wow this stuff really works when used correctly! I used the Meguire's Final Inspection spray as a lubricant (mandatory) and cleaned  off 5 years or road grime from the lower third of my SUV in no time at all. It was heavy and thick and not the paint is smooth as glass. Get a few containers of the clay for a SUV or large car because it does get dirty and you will drop a piece or two during the cleaning process. Meguire's has some very good How-To video's demonstrating the proper way to use this product.	2
This used to be my favorite tweezer until I found Revlon Platinum Tweezer, Slant Tip.  Now it is just ordinary.  The tip is great and it holds well and all, but the Platinum has such a finer tip and I have uploaded just how micro fine it is in my images here:http://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-media/customer-gallery/AXQNEMI9N0Z2D/ref=cm_aya_bb_listsWhile I haven't uploaded a picture of the Revlon Expert Tweezer here, it is similar to the Tweezerman tip in width.  The Platinum really is much finer and easier to use.I hope this helps.	12
"It's wintertime and there's nothing better than a hot cup of tea on a cold winter's day.  Tazo's ""Wild Sweet Orange"" has been a favorite tea of mine for almost 10 years now. I first got a sip of Tazo when we lived in Portland, OR and I learned from the natives that a hot cup of tea from a local vendor was better than a pair of gloves to keep you warm. I still love ""Wild Sweet Orange"" especially with just a hint of cinnamon to pick up the flavor."	11
I've been very discouraged lately at the changes in hair color.  It used to last much longer, and the color was better.  This time I tried Medium Auburn, and it said to leave it in for 20 minutes.  I left it in for  45 minutes just to be sure, and there's barely any color.  My hair is soft and shiny, I'll give it one star for that. But I could get these same results using a deep conditioner, and it is FAR too expensive for that.  I guess I'm going to have to get brave and graduate to henna.	4
I purchased the Go, Diego, Go! series for my granddaughter!  She watches it on our Kindle, and is very interactive with the stories.  As a toddler, she learns  problem solving skills, names of many animals, compassion for them as well.  She simply enjoys the music, action, and the vivid colors.  Go, Diego Go! is not only entertainment for your little ones, it's a learning process as well.  I would recommend it to all parents, grandparents who are looking for something special for their children! A thumbs up!!!	0
Kindle for AndroidIf you have a Kindle account and an Android device you need this app. Without it I couldn't read my ebooks on my Android. I have found that in using an Android tablet, in my case it's a Pandigital SuperNova, you should have your Amazon Kindle archive account listed as a favorite in your browser. This way you can go to your book list and simply tell it to download to which device you are using.As with most anything you get or do with Amazon you can't go wrong. It's all good.	1
I just watched this last night, and to be frank I don't understand the hate. I felt that Kevin Kline is a hilarious character in this film, he lights up the screen every chance he can get. He did great in this. Paul Dano is also one of my favorite actors, and I thought he did great as well. The supporting characters like John C. Reilly and Katie Holmes did great as well. I found it very entertaining and I would definitely watch it again. I would highly recommend it.	0
"No Doubt's TRAGIC KINGDOM is a classic album from the mid 90s. It has a unique sound that no one else was making at the time. There is a unique mix of reggae, punk, and pop found on this album. I remember how huge it was at the time. It has really aged well...10 years on and it's still a very listenable album. Singles included ""Just A Girl"", ""Spiderwebs"", ""Sunday Morning"", ""Don't Speak"", and ""Excuse Me Mister"". The album has a whole is great and there is no filler! Classic!"	9
This is a pretty basic cedar bird feeder. So far it's lasted 6 months and hasn't broke, although I haven't had any issues with larger animals trying to get at it. Holds a fair amount of feed (enough to last weeks), and it looks better then a lot of the cheaper or overly unnatural looking feeders that are common. My only real complaint is the short/cheap rope it came with. Replaced that with a longer/more durable nylon rope I had and it's held up great!	18
Games for younger kiddos are pretty hard to find. &#34;Don't Break the Ice&#34; is one of the few that our kiddos love. You can play a different variation each time to hold their attention, and its a wonderful way to work as a family to build skills of focus, concentration, and &#34;good sport&#34; values.As expected, with the lower price point does come some quality issues-- this is fairly sturdy, but not durable enough for years and years of play. If one piece breaks, the whole game is essentially useless.Overall, its a great game and will amuse most kiddos.	22
My brother purchased one of these at a trade show for almost double what it sells for here. After I saw it, I had to have one too. This thing is put together very well, with quality parts and good fit and finish. If you have the water pressure, using this will probably allow you to roll a small dog or cat down your driveway (not that you should, but you'd be able to)! Operation is smooth and it's comfortable in the hand. Made in China.	2
"This is an excellent movie.  It is not the ""chucky"" horror flick, it is heavy duty drama which in its own way is a ""horror flick"".  The actors were excellent and the story good.  It's story that fringes on true horror. The evil intentions of one in authority manipulating the innocent towards the destruction of their own soul; by committing atrocious vile acts against others.  I gave this movie five stars for the extremely talented Actors, Director and Writer of this film. I had almost forgotten what a really good movie was..."	0
This is great, partly because it's low-profile and doesn't take up much space, and also (best of all) because it's SO easy to clean!  The plastic seems super-slippery so all potty messes slide off OR are easily wiped away with cleaning solution.  Even the white doesn't discolor over time.  The slight rubber bottom keeps it sticking to tile, so that's convenient.  I would definitely recommend this to any and all looking for a small, simple quality training toilet.  For boys, the pee guard lip works pretty well.	3
This compass is just what you need if you're trying to navigate using maps. It's well made and very reasonably priced.The compass is easy to read and is well damped by the liquid inside.This isn't the type of compass you'd want to use for regular hiking, but it very well suited for use with maps and charts. Since it doesn't fold, you'd have a hard time putting it in your pocket.For normal hiking, I prefer a lensatic compass. It's very easy to shoot a bearing to a landmark. Brunton makes a pretty decent unit.	20
Ok I bought this b/c I wanted a icing knife that was long enough to do the whole top of a 9 inch circle cake (what I typically bake). Unfortunately, while the knife is long like I wanted, it is too flimsy and flexible to do much else. I can't stir the frosting w/ it unless  I want to do a weak job, I can't frost the sides b/c of it's flimsiness, etc. So, OXO, please make a more sturdy long knife if you haven't already!	13
I'll be honest, this is my first belt sander, but I love it.  I took the recommendation of some of the other reviewers, and I couldn't agree more.  The sander is easy to use out of the box, and is a smooth-running,  well-designed tool.  The variable speed switch is very nice, and adds  considerably to the user's control.  I haven't yet done any heavy duty  sanding, but for finish work the dust collection seems to work well.  Five  stars for Bosch on this one.	21
It's not flimsy to me at all.  Maybe because the carpeting in our apartment stabalizes it, but it's perfect.  I also think it's very pretty - it brightened up the room.  I just love it.  Makes me want to further decorate the room for the baby.  Perfect height for me as well and plenty of storage room.  I do wish the pad furnished was a bit thicker and softer but it's sufficient.  I like how it's covered in smooth vinyl so we can clean it very easily.  Great table for a great price!	3
You get what you pay for. This is a no-nonsense cheap guitar stand. Its adjustable, padded, and has a nifty rubber band that holds the neck of your axe so when you, a stage groupie, or your clumsy drummer trip on it, the whole mess falls over. This is perfect for your Fender Starcaster or screaming pink Hello Kitty guitar. This is not a good choice for your prized 1968 Jimi Hendrix Strat or 1964 Eric Clapton Gibson ES335. You might want to consider something a bit more sturdy for those.	16
Good show from Tom and the boys (and girls).  The video itself is dark but it is 25 years old.  It's still very entertaining.  Also very nice to watch a concert video where they film the band much more than the crowd.  I don't buy concert videos to watch the crowds.  Besides the darkness I only have two other complaints, having a pre-teen and a teen I could do without the off-color word used a few times (f---).  Number 2 why do they have to roll the ending credits over the last song?  Couldn't they have waited until the concert was over?	6
I had the 850 and thought that it was decent but could be better so I bought the 700. Let me just say that I own the Motorola V330 and from reading the other reviews, it seems that this headset works best with the razr. That being said, it does not work well with the v330. If you move more than 4 feet away from your phone, you get a ton of static. People tell me that I sound muffled when I'm talking to them. My advice is to only get this if you have the razr otherwise forget it.	7
I bought this for my granddaughter who was just a little over a year old, she is 2 now and doesn't care to really want it read to her anymore, I bought other books that she interacts with ..for example &#34;let's say our colors&#34; and noisy zooshe loves them and still plays with them but not this oneThe monkeys are just a hard plastic face and she just doesn't care for it anymore..she loves books and always wants to be read to but for some reason she never grabs this book for us to read	22
This is the stuff. And as pointed out by another reviewer, SPF 25 would definitely be a better precaution than 15 but this moisturiser is so good otherwise I can overlook it for now. The main aspect of it that appeals to me is that the product actually stays on the skin and keeps moisturising all day. On a face as dry as mine is that is a rare accomplishment. Other creams bite the dust in a few hours on me.A reliable product that does what it claims to do at an especially good price.	4
"This product is as close to useless as it can get.  It's a waste of money.  First of all, it falsely advertises as  it doesn't ""peel"" anything.  Normally with a face masque of any kind, you will see a remarkable instant ""glowing"" or ""brightening"" of your skin because it deep cleans.  This product is too thin to be of any benefit.  It does not deep clean and the slightest bit of perspiration will immediately start to dissolve it.  After one tube, I would never buy it again and I do not recommend it."	4
OK, so I tried to save some $$ by getting the generic at my local store.  Big mistake.Went back to the doctor and he recommended this brand by name, so I ordered it here because it was cheaper than my drug store.I am on my second box now and it has made a world of difference in how I feel and in my test results.  I always thought generics were just the same as the name brands, but that is not the case for this supplement. I will be buying this brand again	12
"For the money this is a good quality piece.  The wide metal band is durable but at the same time awkward because it is so wide.  There were only two problems.  One is that it hurts my ears a little.  But that is livable.  The other is that it advertises that it comes with a ""case"" which is actually a cheap plasticy bag that is slightly smaller then the headphones.  I really need a carrying case so I will have to find something else stronger and a little large so I can carry this in my pack without destroying it."	10
I read the first 4 books, but have been listening to this audiobook. I love this series by George RR Martin, but the reader of the audiobooks leaves much to be desired. Especially annoying is the high nasal voice he gives to all the female characters, so that they all sound like illiterate crones. And why did he choose such an odd accent for Tyrion? In places the reader slurs the names of people and places, leaving the listener confused as to who or what is being referred to. Very disappointing.	5
Pros:Generous supply in 32 oz bottleWorks in fuel or mixed with engine oilSmells pleasant (minty, clean)Keeps cold engine start-ups slick and quickCons:Thin lubricantThins out your oilIt is a solvent, it MIGHT (no facts to support that possibility yet) deteriorateyour gaskets, seals.Claims:Cleans out engine, plugs, valves, and injectorsMY recommended use:8 - 10 oz per oil change(they recommend 20% mmo with engine oil change. That's about a quart)4 - 6 oz per 12 gallon fuel tankAt first use, keep engine idle for 30 mins for complete mixup and soak in.Then you drive for 1 hour, then you can switch engine off.	2
I'm an International DJ doing Trance, Rave, D&B, Ambient, and Dubstep. I've owned these headphones for 8 years and they truly NEVER fail me. No matter how hard the bass drop, No matter how long a Trance chorus, They've never popped a speaker and never quit. If you're a REAL DJ and you need a headphone that will last you past a decade then get a pair of these. Armin Van Buuren doesn't use them for no reason, and other Professional DJ's know where its at; Sony MDR-V700's.	10
I purchased this after reading many reviews.  I tested this prior to install and it did have issues turning very fast, however when they built my house they left the water pressure on the low side....barely over 30psi.  Once I bumped it up it worked better.  Installation was pretty easy.The hose they give you that hooks up to the garden hose was not long enough to reach the other side of the camper so I had to mount the bracket on the bumper...I will extend this someday.	2
Don't believe the high praise many give this book. The characters are all unappealing and impossible to connect too,  the events are frequently unrealistic,  and the book drags terribly at times.  It certainly isn't all  bad.  Sometimes it seems as if it's about to get positively interesting but  it always manages to get back off track.  The idea:  the first colonist on  Mars deal with idealogical conflicts about how to treat this new frontier  could have made a compelling book.  But in this case, it didn't.	5
My 'ricer' - collander - food press arrived just an hour ago. I have fond memories of this 'ricer', a favorite kitchen implement of my Dad's. I still have an old pestle from the old days.  The design is a little different from the ones of my childhood, but I think this design appeals to me more.  I love 'riced' potatoes and anticipate using this 'food press' to make tomato purees and finish other fruit. I'm just excited to have it.	13
Unique game.  Kids love it.  It's a bad name for the game though because my 8 year old boy has to repeat the name of the game with emphasis on the Dix part until I tell him to stop.  The way you play the game is describing a card but not too well.  Describe your card too well and you get no points, not well enough and you get no points.  Has to be in the middle if that makes sense.  Pictures are weird and strange depictions of surreal scenes.	22
This watch has everything I was looking for.  It is clear and concise, has day/date feature and Indaglo so I can see it in the dark.  I travel a lot and don't have to turn on the light at night.  I have a collector watch I am retiring and have a band I wanted to transfer to the new one.  Fine.  I read a complaint from someone regarding setting the day.  To do this you wind the watch backwards and the day will change correctly.  Otherwise, you will mess everything up.	8
I purposely read Water for Elephants very slowly because I didn't want it to end. I thought the story was imaginative and magical, the characters vivid, and Gruen really brought the gritty 1930s circus atmosphere to life. I rarely re-read books, only because there are so many others to read, but this one I will re-read. One reviewer said it's just a notch above standard chick-lit, and I couldn't disagree more. This is literature. It's a fairy tale for grownups, and I mean that as high praise.	5
With OUTRIDER, Mr Jimmy Page releases the album fans during the seventies always wanted but never received.  This is a Blue's Guitar Album.  WASTING MY TIME and PRISON BLUES draw from the hard rock well of the early days.  And why not?  It was Mr Page who dug that well.  The production quality is what you would expect, that is, something better than anyone else can do.  Robert Plant, Jason Bonham as well as the &quot;guitar orchestra&quot; make appearances.  If you are interested in hearing a Blue's Guitar album from Mr Page, this CD will interest you.	9
Love this stuff, it is the best lubricant I have ever used.  It is great for all areas that need a little lubricant.  Lasts a long long time and only a few drops will do the job (unless its a marathon session).  Slick and slippery without the sticky mess you get from water soluble lubes.  This is silicone and its the best.  A little more money up front, but will last much longer than anything else so the value is outstanding.  Pay the money and you'll see that its worth its weight in gold.	12
It's a short ethernet cable (only needed it to run between my router and a device practically next to it)It works like an ethernet cable should(Relatively) CheapThe snagfree design is better than I've seen on many others. It doesn't cover the tab itself making it hard to release like other cables. I found it quite neat that it just has guards on both sides of the tab that extend a bit past the end of it so that things can't (easily) snag on the tab and still be very easy to depress when you want to disconnect the cable.	10
This game is amazing! It takes me back to playing X-Wing and Tie Fighter on DOS as a kid. It's nice to actually play a tactical game with amazing looking pieces and gripping gameplay that doesn't involve a tv or monitor.I've never played table/live rpg games before. This thing has me hooked. The interaction with a friend is great. I also like the fact that there is no set board. You and the other designate the playing field. This is a very cool feature. I can't wait to start playing on starfield mats.	22
While the first two seasons were very successful, the third season is awful. THe idea of changing the format slightly is understandable and the creators were probably aftaid of getting in a rut. The problem is that the show was really very good. Until, at first Earls goes to prison, during which time he stops crossing things off his list and then he goes into a coma and it gets worse, a lot worse. Also, while previously the storylines were funny now the want to shock also slightly and the whole concept does not work anymore really.	0
I like the durability of it, and the on/off switch. it came with a carrying bag and a mic holder + adapter. its not as powerful and clear as i though it would be, but its far better than the other mics in the price range that i have used. i haven't tried this through a PA live yet. i just bought an Helicon voicetone and im hoping it boosts it a little. im sure i will have this mic for years to come and hopefully i can spring for a better Shure later on.	16
So far there are 866 reviews for this book, so there's nothing I can say that's different from anyone else.  It got to be so absorbing by the middle of the book with a VERY satisfying ending.  I couldn't resist adding another review to thank Sara Gruen for this wonderful story.  I just finished it a minute ago...I ignored my kids all night while caught up in this story.  Now my kids can have me back!  Please read and enjoy this book.  Thank you.	5
Wow. Wow. Wow.  I bought the 3-book bundle for Kindle because it was a good deal.  Now that I've read the series, I know it was a FANTASTIC deal.  The writing, the plot, the hero and heroine -- you know, it's a little like opening a box expecting it to be empty, and finding it filled with all of your favorite things.  It's like Christmas in July or anytime you read one of these books.  If you like a well-written suspense/romance novel, read more of the Lady Julia Grey books.  Fabulous.	14
I've purchased other 'no bleed-through' labels from office supply stores and found that they fall flat on their claims. When I heard these labels were suppose to stop bleed-through, I bought a pack of folders to go with it, figuring it wouldn't work as advertised and I'd end up tossing some old files. I was shocked when they actually covered up the DARK writing underneath. I often use a very thick, black marker for writing on some folders, and these labels didn't allow the original writing to bleed through at all. Very impressive.	17
I was pretty impressed when I saw this when it first came out [in a theatre]. While its flaws are more obvious now, it is worth having for any Zep fan. The fantasy sequences are a bit silly at times, Planty's ego is too and some of the performances are a bit dodgy against Zeppelin's best work. But it is worth it just for the 25 minute 'Dazed And Confused', a magic moment in rock history, rambling but not a note out of place. Here and in some other parts, it is a joy to watch the band,Page especially, at work.	6
I am not a picky person with toothbrushes, but the reason this toothpaste dissapointed me was that I expected it to be soft, as the name says. But its just like a regular toothbrush, not as soft as I wanted. I got a soft toothbrush of another brand and was satisfied with that. The good thing about this toothbrush is that its bristles do not wear out pretty fast, they remain intact for a long time. The size is good too, its just that I expected it to be softer.	12
The relay setup is a breeze, if you want to make things easy just connect the aux plug directly to the power plug & horn will work at all times, rather than just when the car is on. You CANNOT take the bolt off on the back, dont try to, the covers can be removed and painted with ease by removing the black screws around the bezel. Also, we cut & drilled a new hole on the bracket to place them where we wanted them & that bracket is made of reinforced Steele & took forever to drill through. Excellent product	2
I carry one of these with me in the woods and camping as a bear deterrent. This little pocket sized horn is as loud or louder than anything else I've seen and some are 2-3x it's size. It's small, compact but super loud. I know it's made for boats but it works well for scaring nuisance animals like bear away from campsites and is good to keep in your backpack if you are hiker. Get lost and you have something that people can hear for 1/2-1 mile away.	20
I was shocked when I was the opening scene for this tape. I was only fifteen when I first viewed this tape. The drugs, nudity and disturbing images were pretty cool to me then, and are even more intresting now than ever. I give this one four stars because most of the concert is recorded with an open mic thus making the sound a B+ for quality. Here you get ten live songs and back stage footage. Get this if you haven't seen Manson live that's all I have to say.	6
My order arrived in good time & packaged well.  I usually only purchase named brand jeans but sincethe size I was looking for was not the normal size you find with Jeans , I decided to purchase it., Very pleased with Carhatt,this is a nice fitting Jeans & soft to the touch, It didn't have the stiff feeling you receive on other Jeans , this is def.the soft  fittings Jeans to purchase ,price was a little high, wish it was less expensive but since the size was perfect will purchase again  Tku  Trish  :o)	8
Clockwork Angles has surpassed Moving Pictures as my favorite Rush album.  Every song on Clockwork Angels is rock solid.  When I listened to it for the first time, it sounded a bit noisy, but each time I put it on, it got better and better.  The last song, The Garden, is especially good.What these three gentlemen continue to produce never ceases to amaze me.  Their musicianship and lyrics are better than ever, but the thing I love the most about Rush is the sincerity that comes out in their music.  There's nothing artsy fartsy about these guys.  They are for real.	6
I'm using this to secure the spare tire on my utility trailer. It has a nice thick cable and it's not too long like a bicycle cable lock. Tubular locks are not my favorite, but overall this device seems like a pretty good deterrent for the casual thief. I did notice that the ring on one end of the cable was drilled out way off center. Maybe not the best quality control? (See it in the pic I posted.) I'm pretty happy with it overall and would recommend it without hesitation.	2
This mic is really nice. I have used it on many recordings and it still amazes me that it can sound so great. Works great on voice overs, singers, and rappers.That said, it won't outperform the mics you would encounter in studios today, but with a little tweaking, and the right preamp, this mic can sound great.There was one review that mentioned it isn't for female vocalists. I've only used it on one and it sounded great, not as good as the one I used in studio, but it worked in a pinch for overdubbing with no studio time available.	16
I purchased this for my son to use while hes doing his school work and reading in bed. The good thing is that he can use it on his desk and his bed via the headboard. The arch neck sometimes just falls so it doesnt hold that arch for long periods of time could be cheaply made. Another issue that we noticed was that the light would get hot, equivalent to an incandescent. I purchased this because it was LED and it seemed like it was durable. I think it should be in the 15 dollar range or less, not worth over that....	21
I love the smell of this.  It is the srongest that I have smelled and makes a rich later.  It is rather pricey so I recylce my lather pumping hand soap bottles and use this in it.  Basically fill the empty foaming soap bottle 2/3 full of water and fill up the rest of the way with Dr. Bronner's (leave about an inch so there is room for the pump).  Close it up tight and shake.  You will still get the same great scent but the bottle will last so much longer.	20
I have bought Bali bras before and have not had problems with them.  Had under wire bras quite a few times and didn't have problem with them either.  Have worn 1 twice and I was at work and I had to cut out the under wire is was so uncomfortable.  I will be returning the other 3 that I bought.  If I was smaller they probably would be alright, but being on the heavier side when I sit down there is not enough padding on the bottom of the bra to protect the mid-section.	8
I have this guy in a 40 gallon goldfish aquarim along with a typical HOB. I love the biological filtration this little guy provides - the inserts (aside from the carbon) are great for colonizing the beneficial bacteria that maintain your tank's cycle. I really like that you can adjust the flow rate. Also, it runs pretty quietly, which is a huge plus. My only grievance is the little thing that levels it on the back of my tank keeps falling off.. Aside from that, this filter has been perfect so far. Highly recommend.	19
I learned a lot about World War II history by watching this series. The 2 DVD set consists of several programs that were created by the History Channel, and so each segment does have a definite &quot;made for TV&quot; feel to it. But each segment is also a nice easy-to-watch bitesize piece of history. I had hoped Netflix had this for rent, but since they didn't I ended up buying it. Unfortunately, it's the kind of thing I'll probably only watch once. But it's definitely entertaining and educational.	15
Oxo is fond of rubberized grips, which do make for comfortable usage. I honestly don't think there is much to a Pastry tool such as this to help convince you whether you want to purchase it or not.It's a simple multi-purpose tool and made well, comfortable, has convenient measurements etched into the sides and priced reasonably well.The only disadvantage to having a nice comfortable grip is that it is bulky and takes up an uneven amount of drawer space since it doesn't sit flush on its side. Your mileage may vary depending on your drawer space and orientation.	13
Woody Allen's directorial debut, and it's still funnier than many of his later movies.  You know, he tended toward introspection over comedy in later years.  At the time I ordered, this import was the only widescreen version (zone 0) available in north america.  Sure, it has some korean styled packaging, but you still get english audio and subtitles.  The movie itself is is fresh comedy from a guy making a funny movie, not a commercial movie.  Beware, this movie contains prison scenes and carved soap.	15
ok so I got this app....and I was alone on my sofa and it said there was a ghost around my kitchen....and 2 seconds later the broom dropped.....I ran leaving my kindle on my sofa..when I came back after 5 seconds my kindle was in the kitchen! I screamed when something touched my back..and it was my cousins! those 4 sisters saw it all and threw a trick on me......but they swore to God they didn't touch the broom..men..it can happen....right?	1
The pump works fine. Filled the bed in about a minute. But if I need another (or a replacement) I'd get one that works on household AC power.  This needs 4 D cells.  Since I expect to use it only occasionally, the batteries might be dead by then.Of course, running on batteries is better during a power outage ... but, come to think of it, I don't need any power to sleep in my bed. (Just to get up, some mornings.)Since I've only used it once, I can't attest to relaibility.	20
Any place you have plastic that bakes in the sun, you need this.  Dashboards, bumpers, dinghies, gaskets and tires all benefit from slathering on 303.  On most of the exterior gaskets on my 8 ton M35A3 I slather silicone on them.  But use 303 on the six tires that now cost $1800 apiece and weigh about 300 lbs with wheels and run flats.  They dont get used much, and baking these in the sun is the fastest way to decompose them.  Keeps the Michelin rubber nice and soft...and no cracks.	20
JUNK!!!......This product must be miss labeled.  I can not get my Samsung S2 phone to charge with this OEM charger.  The lights are on, the phone says its charging but nothing happens.  I am not sure if I got a defective product but it is very upsetting to sit in your car for hours and not see your phone recharge.  If you need a reliable charger, DO NOT purchase this product.If you need a car charger for your Samsung S2, I would recommend the Motorola Vehicle Power Adapter.  It charges fast and is dependable.	7
B-Legit holds it down for the Yay Area but not with &quot;The Click&quot; but solo wise. He makes sure you feel this album with knockin' beats and lyrics showing you that he's not in 40 waters shadow. Not only does he put it down by himself but he features some of the top rappers puttin' it down for California. I recommend this album to everyone who likes E-40, Suga T, D-Shot, and &quot;The Click&quot; because B-Legit shows he's a major part of &quot;The Click&quot;	9
I purchased these because the regular nipples on my wide-neck Dr. Brown bottles have too fast of a flow for my 3 week old (side note: these fit the Dr. Brown's wide-neck bottles perfectly). These Avent #1 nipples have the same problem: they are just too darn fast. My son choked on the milk from his bottle when we used these because the milk was pouring into his mouth. I see that some other reviewers with newborns have loved this nipple.  I guess every infant's needs are different.	3
it stays stuck, on fiberglass at least.  easily cut to shape.  seems to protect.  i'm using it on the bellypan of my motorcycle track fairing, which is fiberglass.  i'm told fiberglass won't bubble like stock type fairings will, so i may not have needed it.  but i put it on just in case, and whether it's because i didn't need it or the stuff is working, but my paint isn't bubbling.  which is all i care about.	2
I am not a fan of Stephen King. He usually tries to slam Christianity every chance he gets so I usually avoid anything he does. Not sure why I gave this a try but I am glad I did. It took a couple episodes for everything to start to mesh but by the middle of the season it was great. I am really looking forward to its return. The only problem is, whenever I recommend it to anyone... they haven't heard of it. Give it a chance and you won't be sorry.	0
I have been using these strings for 7 years.  At first I used the Elixir Polywebs, but those things broke all the time.  I switched to these and haven't broke a string since.  If you play a Gibson or Martin I would buy a heavier string, but these match well with my 414ce Taylor.  Because of the price I don't use these on my cheap Fender Acoustic, for that I suggest Earthwoods.  I even use the Electric version of these strings on my American Srat, very pleased there as well.	16
Two of my fish had their fins damaged by an aggressive tank mate.  While this is a nice water conditioner, I bought it with specific hopes that it would aid in my fishes tail fins regrowth and it has done just that.  I was very upset at the damage and didn't know how well mother nature alone would take care of it and this stress coat fish and tap water conditioner has definitely delighted me with it's efficiency.  Pay close attention to the dosing.  Extra size dose is recommended for fin damage.	19
[One CD, with a running time of 44 minutes.] Ah...this wonderful CD shows off Enya's silky smooth voice. The eleven tunes are hauntingly beautiful. I won't try to categorize her music, it is simply too rich and complex.The paperwork includes the words to ten of the songs (The Memory of Trees is a musical number), and two nice color pictures of Enya. (I love extras!) So, if you like Enya's past hits, then I think that you will like this one as well. Buy it!	6
All three books in this series were wonderful from start to finish. The characters were well rounded and so lovable that you forgot they were characters in a book. I found myself not being able to put them down and staying up late into the night to find out what would happen next.I loved how it went from the boy to his daughter and then both of them together. This was a fantastic series for young adults or adults that are young at heart. I highly recommend this book, all three books, to everyone!	14
I would recommend this to everyone. My daughter, husband and myself are all using it. It is so simple to use and understand. If you can not find the food listed you can use the information from the package and add it to the lists. I would never have believed I would be following this. It also made it simple to add exercise and using it for calorie information too. So far I do not have any complaints about it. I am using it on my Kindle Fire and love it.	1
I've always loved watching these movies at Christmas, the DVD's just weren't formatted to fill the entire screen on my HDTV and it always kind of annoyed me to have to play with the screen settings and zoom to get it to look right. (As one of my friend's says, I'm an HD snob). When I saw that this was available for around $10 for both (when I purchased it) I couldn't resist! The picture quality is far better and there are bonus features that weren't on the DVD's I had.	15
The best radio app on the android market.period.I live in Chicago and this app allows me to listen to all my favorote radio station locally and internationale.The one thing I appreciate about it is that it allows me to use other apps and things while listening,while other apps hold me hostage to the app and not do anything else.The sound is clear and its has never dropped a station in my 3 mints of using it.I strongly encourage you to try this app.Its for the casual radio fan and the hardcore fan alike.	1
This show had so much promise.  Sure some of the characters were dreadful in dialogue.  Yes, you could tell things were off to a slow start.  But when the V first hit Earth it's all very exciting.  Then the show was thrown into a pile of trash, and is generally not worth watching.  I recommend watching the series until the V introduce themselves on the giant undership screens, then hit your foot with a hammer, and save yourself the time of watching anything further.	0
Overall, I really like this bluetooth speakerphone. But, I have had problems with the slide-out microphone not going back in after use. I actually had to open it up and glue the holding latch back in place twice now. A pain? Yes. But not too much to stop using it - the sound quality is the best I've used so far.**********Updated 6-28-2012I was correct in my initial review, the slide-out mic was a problem. It eventually broke and was unusable after that. I went to the Motorola TX-500 and couldn't be happier.Motorola TX500 Universal Bluetooth In-Car Speakerphone - Black - Retail Packaging	7
Prompt delivery, and it is exactly as described.  The only reason I did not give it 5 stars is because I haven't washed it yet- so I don't know how it will hold up... Other than that my little girl LOVES her tutus (we got one in light pink also), especially spinning and running in them :)  She's on the little side, so my concern was that it would be too big, but the fit is perfect!  The elastic waist will expand with her as she grows.	8
These dyes create awesome colors for kids crafts. I have used them to make finger paint, paint, play dough, and salt dough.Another reviewer stated that they are not natural - this is CORRECT. They are definitely artificial dyes. I tried making my own dyes, and when that fell through, these worked great in a pinch. You only need a couple drops for really vibrant color. And they are pretty easy to clean - don't stain after they've been made into whatever craft.Good product for the price!	11
"My 6 yr old daughter loved this gift. The kit was simple and easy to understand. She wrote her own story one day, and we mailed it the next. There were no additional charges, not even for shipping, because we only wanted 1 book. The turn-around time was reasonable - I think around 4 weeks. The final product was beautiful and very solid. She ran around the house saying, ""I'm an author! I can't believe it!"" We will definitely buy this product again in the future and we recommend it to others."	22
Long battery life, connects quickly to phone. Phone callers can't even tell I am on a BT headset, no complaints of inablility to hear my voice will on a call. It is not for people with wide necks, does not stretch much. Can slide back when active and the earphones are not in your ears. Otherwise light, controls are easy to reach and distiguish. I have the similar LG HBS730 but prefer these due to the ease of finding the buttons you want but prefer the flexible neck of the LGs.	7
Absolutely love this screen protector. It came on time and the product was just as expected. I love how it comes equipped with everything you need to install it. A wetnap, dry nap, cleaning cloth, and the flattening clip you use to even out the protector once its on. It looked very professional and my Galaxy S4 Screen looks SUPER vibrant and clean. You can not even tell that theres a screen protector. I would recommend this screen protector to anyone because the value surpasses the price. Afforable and efficient.	7
Instead of following the Dexter formula (12 episodes seasons), this new season of Lie To Me expanded to more than twenty episodes. In this case, this implied a lsos of quality, unfortunately.THings are some how weird in this season. The freshness and sheer brilliance of the first season (however flawed or not the whole concept may be) are gone since Episode One. Tim Roth, however, is still great to watch, as is Gillian Foster (forgot the name of the actress).BUt thing are kind of formulaic here. A lot of episodes are completely stand-alone.

Please note that though my dogs are capable of ripping this or any fabric toy to shreds, for reasons only known to them, they don't do this. (a Big Retriever Mix & a giant Great Pyrenees mix). This squeaky duck is their favorite for fetch and the toy each consistently chooses to initiate a few rounds of big dog wrestle-rumble. The squeaker holds up to a lot of use and this toy does just fine when run through the washer & dryer, if you find your pup or pups tend to &#34;suck&#34; their stuffed animals and thus render them totally funky.	19
I purchase this vinyl to add to my collection.  I loved this project when it dropped in the mid-90s but I've lost the CD since then.  The only complaint I have is how the records do not fit well in the jacket.  It's a 4 album set/double jacket with 2 albums fitting in each jacket.  It seems to me the manufacturer should have increased the width of the sleeves. It was hard to get them out and darn near impossible to get them back in,  But the albums play great!	9
Although I have an older version of this B&D work bench, I do have to say at this point that I like the way the bench part is on the older version verses this one. Kind of on the light side.....in my opinion. I do like the feature to where you can flip the bench up on one side in order to hold a larger product. I'll just have to see how it works out over time. Just seems to me it's not set up as well, (as far as heavy duty) as the older one is.	21
Of all the movies i've seen about the crucifixion and resurrection of the Christ, this movie has the most accurate portrayal as I've seen so far even though in the bible Jesus had suffered a far more gruesome beatings than what was shown in film but it's as close as it gets. The movie also has the characters speaking in hebrew instead of english unlike other films about the crucifixion. However I suggest that people watch this film with caution, it shows alot of graphic stuff including blood and it's definately not for younger children.  It's a great film overall.	15
This one is easy.  Put your stuff in, add a little water then push a button.  Truely a no brainer.  The only reason it didn't get 5 stars is that you do have to drain it after each use.  My freind didn't and something started growing in it.  Other than that, this is perfect.  If you take out the racks you can fit a ton in it at once.  You don't have to watch over anything-go ahead and take care of your baby while this one does all the work for you.  Put this time saver on you registry.	3
The pants arrived quickly and without any rips, stains or damages. The pants were a little bit too big when I took them out of the package but they fit perfectly after I washed them once. I've only worn them as work pants 9-10 times but so far they are very durable, not too warm, and the pocket on the lower right thigh is very handy to hold a knife, pen, box cutter, flashlight, or many other things. I would absolutely order another pair of these if I needed to.	8
But I HATE the way they all flock to the oak trees on our property, and dig up the lawn trying to save the acorn bounty. I've used other Havahart products with a good level of success, so was hoping this one would be the same.It is! The sprayer worked great to cover a lot of area, and I've noticed a better lawn. While I still see the critters, especially after a good rain, my lawn is the proof of fewer varmints. While it is not 'odorless' as it claims, there is very little scent.Thanks, Havahart!	18
I bought this to restore the neck of an Ibanez that I had ordered used and knew needed TLC.After a few coats of this stuff the neck looked/played/felt like it was just out of the factory! It restored years of neglect in just a few minutes.When I bought this I though it wouldn't be enough. BOY WAS I WRONG. I'll have enough of this oil to last me awhile which makes me happy because I can get that new guitar feel out of my neck for months if not years to come.	16
This is a fantastic product. It has a lot of room to store the dirty diapers, and yet there is little to no smell. You know when it's full because the plunger won't go down all the way, and you can't return the handle to the other position. When you take the garbage bag out, you can tell just how much smell you'd be in for with any other container. I also like that you can use whatever garbage bags you want with this, instead of having to buy special ones. A good buy.	3
Does what an oil filter should for a good price. I trust Bosch, as I have owned Bosch power tools for decades and always have been pleased with their quality of function and longevity. I have a Bosch corded drill that is 40 years old and works like new. Can't get the power of line electricity in a battery drill, so you will always need a corded drill on hand to do the job when your lithium can't.  Bosch and Makita are the only brands I buy in tools. The best.	2
If you enjoyed the girl groups of the early 1960's this video is a must for you.  Chances are very good the songs you enjoyed girl groups sing are included here.  Ronnie Spector and The Ronettes singing Be My Baby is worth the price in itself.  The 1960's was a time of great music, and a large number of those memorable songs came from the girl groups.  I'm planning on using this video in my after school class of 5th-7th graders after we sing a number of the songs.  I know they will enjoy it.	6
If you've been thinking of getting one of the A&amp;E DVD re-issues of the original 'Avengers', start with this one. The stand-out episode here is 'Honey For The Prince', which is imaginative, funny, and extremely  eccentric (a cricket match breaks out during one scene). There is also the  infamous 'Touch of Brimstone' -- notable for its bawdy content and Diana  Rigg's 'Queen of Sin' costume. Patrick Macnee and Diana Rigg's chemistry as  a team was never stronger than in the episodes on this disc (and you get a  bonus seventh episode with this set, instead of the standard six).	15
I have tried and tried to fild a product that would get rid of those pesky knats!! and fruit flies around the house, and I must say I HIGHLY recommend this product, and is the only thing that has worked well thus far. I keep this running day and night and you would not believe the amount of knats and fruit flies this thing catches!! You better buy more sticky pads, because this thing will sure get filled up quickly. This product receives an easy 5 star rating form me.	18
I am just starting with the product today and to be the first day I can tell it is working because I went to the bathroom nicely, I can say at first you feel like a tickling sensation in your abdomen like a feeling that you gonna get diarrhea but is not; that's just the fact that it is working and cleaning your colon and you feel like that.I wont be explicit but I took a nice day in the toilet =)So far is working for me...!!!	12
The Prophet dispenses ultimate wisdom to his loved ones as he bids fare well.Khalil Gibran defines all that I never had words to define, or more appropriately, did not have the good sense to define.  I discovered this book a while back and took a long time to read it since I refused to rush through it.  I read it a lesson at a time, understanding it to the best of my ability.I found a way of life in these words.  I could read it everyday and each time these words would dispense a new lesson... like a never ending treasure.	5
We gave our baby his first bath in this when he was only 5 days old, and we're still loving it now that he's almost 5 months. It's growing well with him and he always seems secure so that we don't worry about him slipping around. It is a large tub (almost as long and wide as our standard bath), so I don't recommend it if you are looking for something easy to store. However, if you have a dedicated child's bathroom where you can keep it, then this is a great baby bath tub.	3
I was an Dr. Bronner's almond and peppermint junky for the longest time. I've recently been trying the different blends with good results so far. The tea tree oil scent took me a little while to become acclimated to, almost an acquired taste.Fun fact: tea tree oil is a natural antiseptic. Better than scrubbing everything down with the chemicals in antibacterial soap for sure.This isn't my favorite scent, but what can I say? I love Dr. Bronner's. For a grade I give it an A.	20
They are soooo much easier and not near as scary as the old ones.  I don't have to worry about losing my fingers.  I put peanut butter way in the back on the rod instead of where they say to put it, and I catch them every time.I do catch some mice that are small enough to not be harmed, but at least I get them.  And eventually they are not so lucky.  It's so easy to bait and so easy to catch them. Even my kid can do it without harm to her.	18
I have to admit that I purchased these cups to bump up an order ...so I could receive free shipping. I was looking for something cheap to fill the order.  I hadn't thought about replacing my old cups before.  However, I'm glad to have these measuring cups, as they are very durable and well made.  I like the color coded measurements on the handle. There have been a few times that I've inadvertently grabbed the 1/2 cup instead of the 1/3 cup measure in my old set, but I won't make that mistake again with these.	13
I was a little hesitant in ordering this after reading the initial user reviews here, but went ahead and bought a couple anyway.  After attaching the two quick disconnects to a 10' flexible clear hose (made by Jet), I have been using it on various woodworking machines and my dust collector.  So far, I have not experienced any of the disconnect problems expressed earlier.  Perhaps the problem would occur if a shorter and less flexible hose is used.  But these quick disconnects are a godsend for my small garage shop with most of my woodworking machines on mobile bases.	21
My lawn is in pretty good shape but there are some areas under trees where the lawn suffers a bit.  I usually have my lawn aerated because of the size of the lawn for $30.  But I like this tool for breaking up the ground in spots where I need to plant new seed in bare spots.  I also like it for use in garden areas and other places where the large aeration machine can't reach.  I definitely cannot recommend this product for use on a regular size yard, even if you want the workout.  It clogs a little too often.	18
My two young Siberian Huskies play with this.  My girl claims it as hers and often sleeps with it.  It fits her mouth about right, as she is on the small side for Huskies.  This is her 2nd teddy bear.  The 1st lasted about 1 year being squabbled over, pulled on, licked on, and gnawed.  It finally died when she figured out how to open the velcro opening in the back and chewed up the squeaker, the velcro, and other parts of the bear.	19
I will leave a lengthier review to some other ardent Rush fans, though I have loved them since their start! This CD really grows on me and I have listened to it at least 50 times or more! The production and mix is far superior to any of their releases (IMO) since the mid 1980's! I am a huge fan of the classic Rush sound and &#34;A Farewell to Kings&#34; is my favorite Rush recording. But, I have to say, I would have to put &#34;Clockwork Angels&#34; next in in line followed by &#34;2112&#34;. That should say it all!	6
I got this game right after getting a game boy advanced for christmas. The game is real easy to learn and play. I can see how this game is so addictive for younger kids. The puzzles are fun, but not difficult. As an adult, it was a fun  way to while away the hours. I played for 100 hours before beating it. The only problem I had with this game is that there was only one save. It made it impossible for anyone else to play the game. In fact, my 2 year old son erased my first game....	23
My boyfriend and I both have very fair skin that's prone to redness. Aveeno Positively Radiant Daily Moist is a little too orange and shiny on its own. But mixed with Eucerin Redness Relief moisturizer, it's the perfect moisturizer to cover up small imperfections, reduce redness, and provide a natural-looking tone. By itself on my boyfriend, it looks like he's wearing some sort of shimmery makeup. But mixed with the Eucerin Redness Relief (which is green in color), it looks very neutral and natural. I also love the SPF 30!	4
"This USB floppy drive was purchased to allow me to retrieve some files that were still on 3-1/4"" floppy disks (yes, they were ancient). My old PC had a floppy drive in it, but my new laptop did not.The drive plugged in and installed itself with no driver required. The diskettes were read quickly and easily and the data saved off to CDROM for storage.I don't know if I'll ever need this drive again, but if I do, it'll be available and ready."	10
"I bought several meditation CD's from Amazon but ""Goodbye Worries"" is by far the best.There are 4 different sessions on this CD, so it is kind of like getting 4 for the price of 1.  One of the other CD's I bought claimed to be a ""half-hour of peace"" but when you take away the introduction and the music at the end, it was only 15 minutes.There are currently 30 reviews for this posted and all of them give it 5 stars.  This is the best $10  I have ever spent.  Buy this CD.  You will not regret it."	6
I love the Sith stories and the Old Republic stories.  It's cool too see another side of the Star Wars story.  It's always about the selfish Jedi.  Now we get a nice entrance into the world of the Sith.  How do the Sith react to different situations that they are faced with?  This short story tells us what happens.  Starting #2 now.  Oh, and for free you can't complain.  Good sci-fi/space opera story either way.	14
This is probably the best solo album KRS-One has ever put out. Sorry to say there are probably other good ones, but this is the best put together one. The beats, the rhymes, and the material go together very nicely. My favorites are Outta Here, Mortal Thought, I Can't Wake Up, Sound of Da Police, Uh Oh, Return of the Boom Bap, and Stop Frontin'. But the other songs are good too. I recommend this to fans of Boogie Down Productions or Hip Hop in general.	9
Some other reviews say this is not a good hopper, but what can you really expect for around $20?  It works.  I am not nice to it.  I toss it in my trunk and pretty much manhandle it.  No screws have popped out, nothing weird happened.  Sometimes the top pops open in my trunk and a couple of balls fall out...It sits at a good height and makes transporting balls and practicing service very easy.Seriously... $20.  Worth every penny.	20
This is awesome. ghosts are real. the last words it gave me were; hurried, Columbus, New York, directly, and audience. I was standing next to an Adam Dunn poster (white sox) and if you haven't noticed, those words fit in perfectly. even though Adam Dunn isn't dead, it could have also been another baseball player or someone related to him. This Is Real. don't believe the bad reveiws. Wait hang on, new words; look, up, danger....AAAAAAHHHHHHH!	1
Was looking to find a easy way to see whats on tv at a glance.  Works better then any other apps.  Set it up to your area and then remove the channels you don't want and then whenever you bring it up its all up to date and ready to go.  Works well on my fire.  Would reccommend to anyone who can't always keep track of there favorite shows.  Tells you what the episode is about and if its an old or new episode.  Love it!	1
I have liked Dickies products for a long time now.  The work shirts are just slightly larger than a T-shirt would fit.  I understand most mechanics or workers like it a little looser, but it will not fit exactly like a T-shirt might.  It also won't shrink much, if it all, because of the materials it is made from.It keeps you relatively cool, it's very comfortable and durable.  Pretty good price for the quality as well.  Looks good as a work shirt or a casual shirt.	8
I bought this jack stand to replace the assortment of wood blocks that I used under the front tongue of our 20' camper, weight about 500lbs,  when parked at the storage lot or while out camping.  By the second season the base had fatigued and cracked in a circular manner and by the third season I had to remove it from service because I felt it would not safely hold the weight of the tongue.  I was pretty disappointed considering how much I spent and inconvenient is was to store away.  I've moved on to the &#34;Flip-foot&#34; jack extension.	2
I love Fallout, exspecially Fallout 2.  I bought Fallout 2 because I play Fallout and loved it.  If you've played Fallout before Fallout 2 you'll find that Fallout 2 is a lot more discouraging.  It's a lot harder to  develop a new character.  You'll never reach a point where you're immortal  (eg. you can kill anything with ease).  But anyway Fallout 2 is still  great.  I let my friend play Fallout 2 and he had a sleepover at my house  just so he could play Fallout 2.  Everyone I know loves Fallout 2.	23
"One of the funniest shows I've ever seen but, while it's proven it can go the distance, the profanity seems to have been unnecessarily amped up this season and, in my opinion, is detrimental to the show.  The ""mystery poop"" episode takes the show's crudeness to new heights (or lows, rather), but I still found myself laughing.  The absence of the McPoyle family this season was regrettable, but a colonial-era episode where the ""gang"" cracks the Liberty Bell sort of made up for it.  Funny stuff."	0
Just after buying a new computer (Dell), I realized that it would be a good idea to replace my modem to computer (Cat5) cord. When the cords arrived, I connected them then logged on. Could not believe the difference. I was using an older blue cord that I picked up from a family member. I ordered this cable because I wanted a longer cable, but was really happy and pleasantly surprised  with the increased speed. We have SBC DSL Elite, and everything is so much faster with the new Belkin Cat 5. I recommend this Cat5 cable.	10
Somebody is selling top British defense secrets to the enemy. The talented British agent Steed contacts the double-agent barber. They whisper, but not quiet enough. The barber is killed. The list of potential traitors includes three high ranking officers. They have weaknesses: drunkeness (leading to headaches), gambling (to the extent of neglecting official duties), and womanizing. They also have butlers. Steed decides to join a butling (gentlemen's) school. The action becomes more heated with Mrs. Peel joining the force as an officer's girlfriend. At the end Steed and Mrs. Peel are saved by a retired, senile, patriotic, but not really demented general.	15
The Koss PortaPro Headphones are extraordinarily portable, as they fold and slide into an small extremely space.  However, they NEVER retain the tension setting or head band size that you set for best fit between uses (even when not folded) due to design limitations.  They also tend to become uncomfortable to wear after a short period of time at any setting.  If you do NOT need portability as your overriding choice factor, you can do MUCH better with other Koss headphone models or other top rated brands... so keep looking.	10
I see mixed reviews here.  At this price, no telling what the quality control is like but as I wrote in another review on this type of item, you can buy 3 of these and if one fails, you're still ahead of the game.  They're so much less expensive than what one will typically find in a guitar or electronics store, well worth taking a chance.  Mine seems to be fine, doesn't look or feel flimsy at all.  I can't see any difference between this and what I buy in a retail package.	16
I bought this capo thinking it would look slicker without the clamp handles sticking out but what I found is that although it looks cool, it's complicated (which for a capo is saying something). The release lever makes it difficult to get a good amount of pressure on the strings and nearly impossible to put it at the top of the guitar when not in use.Bottom line: If you don't mind the extra effort and don't plan on keeping it on your guitar when not using, then maybe you will enjoy it. For everyone else, look elsewhere.	16
Why does a cheap set of headphones with weird plastic ear-cups and a metal band that catches in your hair get so many five star reviews?  Because they sound amazing.  Nothing in this price range even comes close.  Most people compare these with the Sennheiser PX100 II.  Well, I have both and they are both excellent headphones, and the sennheisers are much better quality, but the sound of the Portapros is much better.  I am on my second pair, and will buy another when this set breaks.	10
This is a super snack to grab when you're about to miss breakfast.  It's not a full breakfast replacement, but you can supplement it with a bit of fruit or yogurt an hour or so later and have a happy tummy.Even better... this is a great dessert... one that satisfies a crunchy sweet craving but doesn't make you feel too guilty.  A lot fewer calories than a typical donut, plus a good helping of fiber and all-natural ingredients.Kashi's done it again.  Tasty, reasonably nutritious.	11
Well, Tenebrae is finally on DVD, and this transfer is beautiful, the boys at Anchor Bay have outdone themselves with this masterpiece of the horror genre.  Dario Argento is truly one of the best horror directors that we  have had the pleasure to experience, I sncerely believe that Tenebrae is  one of the most terrifying, gripping and suspenseful horror films to ever  grace the genre.  I would in every way, call it Psycho's equal.  Disturbing, surreal, beautiful and engrossing in every way, Argento's  Tenebrae is a 5 star classic.	15
"This Permatex Ultrablack is wonderful stuff, a tough sealant and it does NOT tend to harden in the tube - - it's always ready to use when I take off the cap. Unfortunately, this particular item is ONLY 1/2 OUNCE!!So it's not a good deal for the price. There is no info in the item posting, you have to notice the image and the ""0.5oz"" on the package (which I didn't). Go for the 3.5 ounce tube, much better deal.5 stars for the product, 2 stars for the incomplete description."	2
Inexpensive, this kit consists of ten single use tablets.  Instructions are clear and the contents -- a vial, ten test tablets and an eye dropper for water -- are well-designed.  For the price, it provided me peace of mind on my growing conditions and prevented me from pH conditioning the soil where it did not need conditioning.On the downside, readings are not precise.  You'll get a good idea of the general soil pH within a .5 reading, but nothing specific.  That's probably okay, however.  Most times soil conditions are not exact from place to place anyhow and a general idea is what most of us need.	18
"If you liked the Gwyneth Paltrow ""Emma"", well, this one is a bit different.  Kate Beckinsale is truly stunning to look at, but the guy who plays Mr. Knightley is a homely little guy...NOTHING compared to Jeremy Northam!That said, it's a decent adaptation.  Some scenes have almost exactly the same dialogue as the other Emma...but that makes sense, as it is the exact dialogue from the book.  If you can stomach the homely Mr. Knightley, you'll like this movie."	15
I got this product for my wife who was complaining about losing her place in cookbooks while working.  It has worked great!  She is able to put her largest cookbooks, or 3-ring binders, or loose sheets on this holder, and with the elastic strap she never loses her spot.  The holder hasn't tipped over, with heavy books.  Keeping the books upright also makes following the recipes easier.  It does take up some space, but fits above our cabinets, but it could be a concern for some.	17
The Rat has been used by everyone from David Gilmour to Dave Grohl to give you a grasp of its range.  It does everything from light crunch, to Marshall-style thick rhythms, to all out face-melting distortion.Rich harmonics, near infinite sustain, and a mid-range push that will cut through a mix like no other distortion pedal.This pedal has not left my board since the day I bought it.  The fact that it's built like a tank ensures it's going to be around a long time after my playing days are over.	16
This type of RPG was easy to master, because at the start of the game, I chose Bulbasaur for this type of match. I used him in the first 2 stages of the game, but sometimes the rest of the game. Whenever you use a fire-type attack on an ice/water type, it will either say &quot;It's super effective&quot; or &quot;It's not very effective&quot; Otherwise, this game's a blast to play, with 150 different pokemon characters to choose from. Go buy them both. You'll need them to link up to Gold/Silver.	23
I LOVED this book!  The three parts I loved the most were the beginning, the middle and the end.  Great books are far and few between and I am always happy to find one I can't put down.  If you want to get to bed early or get your house work done, don't read this book.  If you don't mind drinking an extra cup of coffee in the morning and putting the dishes off until later than by all means read this book.  Soooooo good.	5
I bought this case because it was very cheap.  I should have known it was not worth it.  The case fit is too tight.  When I put it on my phone, the lip that goes around the front of the phone was uneven.  No matter how many times I tried to take it off and put it back on again, the lip was just uneven.  This caused my screen protector film to be displaced by this case.  It was much more of a pain than a help.  Get the real Samsung case and save yourself the headache.	7
Here are the ADVANTAGES and DISADVANTAGES of this device...ADVANTAGES.1. It produces a fine mist to a stream - the best combination that I have ever experienced..2. It is an excellent replacement for the average pump sprayer..3. The construction material is very durable..4. The balance is very good..5. The device is light..6. The nozzle design is ingenious - it can pivot up and down within 180 degrees...DISADVANTAGES.1. At $18, it is very expensive. You can purchase six regular pump sprayers for the price of one.	18
The original Rush Hour is still much more fun.  The only reason I had to buy this is my son is such a train freak.  The puzzles are not as challenging overall, yet the difficulty level is a bit uneven in the four categories (junior, beginner, intermediate, advanced).  Also, the build quality is poorer, as a few of the train pieces don't sit properly on the board, and the colors on the train pieces do not match those printed on the puzzle cards, a sore point for a young boy.	22
"I have never been a fan of the circus, but I do enjoy historical fiction, so I gave this one a try. I was skeptical at best when starting. The story is mildly interesting, entertaining,and entirely predictable. The characters were shallow, not well developed, but the story moves along quickly enough so this is not a big distraction. An earlier reveiwer summarized the book as ""melodramatic"" and I completely agree. It is like popcorn; light, fluffly, easy to digest and quickly forgotten. Not a bad way to spend a rainy weekend -- if there is nothiing on TV."	5
This is the best Beatles movie it makes a lot of sense and all fans need to roll up to it and let it take you away.  It's truely amazing and the most like yellow Submarine as far as the fact that every time you rewind  you see something that wasn't there the last time.  Fool on the hill is the  realest part and flying will get you.  A must have for anyone interested in  the beatles psycadelic era that describes the reasons behind Sgt. pepperes  Lonly Harts Club Band Album.	6
I know everyone is whining around about the price for a shortened season, but let's face the facts, Season 4 was excellent even against tough expectations.  The humor was still buoyant and creative, and the storylines still had energy as the twists and turns stayed fresh.  Storylines were also craftily constructed to show parallels between characters, or wrapped together 2 or 3 seperate storylines, etc.After the slighest of let-downs in Season 3, Season 4 still shows the punch and zip of a fun and humorous mockumentary that's well edited.	0
I'm always the type that needs to snack on items through the day to avoid headaches and feeling fatigue.  I'm very physically active and don't have time to spend for large meals so need something filling, easy to take with me, and is delicious.  The chocolate craze is essentially like a desweetened chocolate bar for me.  I just can't tire of the taste, it's the best I've ever had with these nutritional bars.  I only wish they were cheaper as it's quite pricey.  But as the saying, you do get what you pay for.	12
I use these in my Canon DSLR flash attachment to get consistent, fast-recycling that simply can't compare to rechargeables or even standard alkalines.  They last a long time, retain power even when they're just sitting not being used, and provide excellent power for photo equipment.  These are worth the extra cost because they last way longer and maintain their high power throughout their life cycle.  I'll be continuing to use these for my camera equipment (though I'll use rechargeables for less critical devices like remote controls, Wii remotes, toys, etc.).	12
Here's the question: does your stuff have to stay *absolutely* dry?  Will a teaspoon or two of water seeping through the seal destroy your cargo?  If so, then this isn't for you if it's going to be in the bed of a truck or in a receiver carrier.  OTOH, if a tablespoon full of water is something you can tolerate, then it'll do that OK.  I suggest drilling weep holes in the bottom.  It's *pretty* tight... but not totally so.  It worked for me carrying camping gear where I can live with a *little* bit of water in a rainstorm.	13
Love this one.Very cool,you could listen to it all day and into the night.Oneof the many features is that you can literally listen to any band in the world.I have relatives living in the states and a broad and be able to dial into their towns and hear not only police traffic but also their weather.Just another great feature is going to the browse section,it will tell you if anything major is happening in a city that is going on.To many features to list,just sit back and enjoy playing with the scanner.	1
I'm really surprised at the 5 star reviews for this potty chair. If I had back all the time I have spent cleaning pee up off the floor I would be so happy. The splash guard is way too short, my son just pees right over the top of it. I do like the separate potty and it's easy to clean but I still have to clean the whole chair because it simply doesn't hold in the pee stream. Ugh. I'm retiring it as soon as I get a different potty chair. MESSY.	3
All right, let's get right down to it! When it comes down to intimate apparel, there is nothing that captures a man's eyes and imagination as thigh-high stockings!These soft and sexy stockings wear well, and stay up. So, you don't need to use a garter, but I do recommend one. (I don't believe in understatement in the bedroom.)I highly recommend these stockings to you - or for you men, buy them as a gift!(Review of Sheer Lace Top Back Seam Thigh Hi Stockings)	8
This was my favorite game when I was a little kid, so I wanted my daughter to have it too. I bought it for Christmas last year when she was 3. We have played it at least once a week since then. I like it better than the older version. The different trees are actually different fruits. Cherry, blueberry, green apple and oranges.We never used the puzzle as part of the game, we just put it in her puzzle collection and she likes to put it together from time to time.	22
I will not say this is a miracle cream, I have always had younger looking skin and wrinkle remover is not something I need. But as a light moisturizer this product is great. My skin feels very soft and a little goes a very long way! In the winter I get very dry patches of skin on my chest and jaw line this cream has helped it immensely before I was having to go to the doctor who was giving me creams used to treat moderate psoriasis but this works just as well and  is much cheaper than the prescription.	4
Bondo in a tube is exactly what you would expect. It's Bondo in a tube. My experience in the past is that it's a one time use product. If you sit it on the shelf after opening it and using it most likely by the time you need it again it'll be hard. I only needed for a couple spots on the car, one where a tree length fell on it, and this product is perfect. Goes on easily, dries hard and is easy to sand. Saves you money from having to buy a large tub.Highly recommended.	2
Product says the Pro's love this stuff but with the little cotton fibers coming loose all the time, (remember this stuff is made from cut up underwear) and leaving tiny little cotton pieces all over the floor, inside and outside all over my guns ain't a good thing to me.Maybe they can be used for something but I don't recommend using as gun patches especially when used when used with cleaning fluid or oil as the fluid just makes it order to pick up all those little almost microscopic pieces of cotton.	20
I love Susan Mallery's more recent books (try the Fool's Gold series) so when I saw older books had been rereleased, I had to buy it. I was really happy I bought parts 1 & 2 at the same time, so I didn't have to pause between books. You don't have to read them in order, the books can all stand alone, but you will understand the dynamics better if you do. And if you love stories about people finding the loves of their lives, you will love this series.	14
"I liked this book.Yeah, I kept wincing every time anybody got chomped upon but then that's what I do whenever I watch a zombie flick or even serial killer movies.I get that zombies able to use reason may put off some zombie fans but I found the idea scary as hell and interesting.Jimbo was really really smart and he was the one to watch out for, instead of Nancy.Hope like hell that Nancy's ""dead"" for good and can't wait to read the next book in the series."	14
Wow. This is one of those animated movies you won't soon forget. With a wonderful score by James Horner, great story, and admirable characters, this is right up there with Disney's best.Basic plot: Boy gets separated from his family on their way to America by boat and must find his way back to them. On his journey, he meets new friends and enemies in one grand adventure in New York. Oh, did I mention the main character and his family are mice? Watch it and enjoy.	6
Some of the Senseo pods lack character and are, frankly, quite bland. However, the Sumatra Blend has a lot of character and tastes very good. It has a smokey, dark flavor to it, reminicent of darker chocolates. I've enjoyed drinking this coffee black, with cream and sweetener, and with flavored creamers. All of them tasted good and the undertones of the coffee even stood out with the flavored creamer, a characterist often lacking in the Senseo Pods. Bottom Line: this coffee tastes great ! ! !	11
"I can sum it up in one sentence: The Worst Movie that I ever saw. I know that Christs last hours were horrifying, but this movie, the way it is cut, goes way beyond what the Bible says. It is like he wanted to make the goriest movie of all times, not a factual account of Christs last hours. It was so bad that I couldnt watch the whole movie. I wish the Mel Gibson had made a ""REAL"" movie of his last hours. Save your money, and read the bible for the truth."	15
It won't give you the colour that shows on, or at the back of the box. not even close! I have medium ash brown hair and the only reason I dye my hair is because of my grey hairs. I just used an &#34;ash&#34; shade of this hair colour to dye my roots and now my roots has an awful copper/red shine, and it doesn't look &#34;ash&#34; brown at all! It has orange undertone:(I am so upset, and recommend you not to use this product at all! Don't even try it or you would regret like me.	4
I'll start by saying I have very sensitive skin, and this did not bother me, so that's definitely a positive! My skin is also very dry, and this is a nice thick, unscented cream that moisturizes without leaving a greasy feel. As far as the wrinkle reducing power, we'll have to see. It claims visible results within 5 weeks, so I'll have to wait a little longer. In the meantime, it's a great moisturizer for sensitive skin for before bed and under my makeup in the morning.	4
I bought this set to fix a pair of eyeglasses that had loose screws. The smallest screwdriver in this kit was perfect for that job, so mission accomplished. The tops of each screwdriver twirls independently from the shaft, meaning you can keep a finger on top of the head to stabilize the driver while you're screwing. (Sorry, there's no other way to say that.) The box suggests these screwdrivers can be used for repairing eyeglasses, cameras, watches, fishing reels, hobbies, electronics, and small appliances. I think this set will come in very handy.	7
"Could not put this book down, read from front to back and held on tight.  Without giving the good stuff away, you are there in the book at all times....amazing....wonderful.The twist on Jacob from the Bible (which you won't notice unless you read the Bible) is a grabber!We all will get old some day.....and if you are close, give this book to family members waiting to put you in a nursing home.  I think what got me the most was  ""pay attention"".I don't even want to see the movie...this was good enough for me!"	5
We got one of these games on the recommendations on Amazon.  We were not disappointed, it is fun, quick to learn, and can be played with children as well as adults.  I tried it on all of them from grand kids to married and college kids and my husband and I alone.  It was fun in every instance.  We then bought 13 games for Christmas presents for friends and families confident that it would be an addition to good times together.  Recommend it as well as Spot It, both new games we tried this year.	22
For some reason, I bought a 1998 M109A4.  Like a lot of these purchases, it seemed to make good sense at the time.  These 6x6s have typically been outside for a long time, and while they dont have a lot of highway miles, they sure do have UV damage and rust.  I have 9 windows and 4 doors with gaskets that are really expensive to replace.  Smear this grease on and the gaskets are generally good as new.  I use it on all hoses and gasketed electrical connections.	2
This book was just okay. The story line was predictable and unmemorable. I couldn't even remember what the storyline was when I would pick it up in the evenings to read another chapter. I don't know about the print version of the book, but in the kindle version, there are many misspelled words which for a &#34;wordy&#34; like me, makes the book seem less than legitimate. I gave it 3 stars because it was better than some novels as far as content but is a far cry from being on anyone's best sellers list.	14
We bought this because my youngest daughter won't train on a potty seat on the toilet, so we thought this might help her transition from diapers.  It's just plastic.  I had hoped there'd be a way to put a plastic liner in the hole part so we could just take the liner off instead of having to clean the plastic bowl, but unless we want her to sit on the liner, that's not an option.  Oh well, it's a big overpriced piece of plastic.	3
My grandkids ask for this frequently altho I do not provide much in the way of TV watching. There is a positive message, no guns or violence or themes that are not age appropriate. The characters look after each other and encourage development of empathy. Still, the dancing around is really silly (from an adult stand point) and somewhat constant. Also, the guy with one huge eye creeps me out but kids don't seem to mind him at all. All in all, good for some down time when needed.	0
Okay, about a month ago, I was in my room getting ready for school. I was in a cross between: a Gryffindor  sweat shirt with worn skinny jeans and Ugg boots or a Camp Half Blood t shirt with skinny jeans and high tops. So I asked the Ghost Radar,&quot; Oh wise and powerful ghost in my room, which shall I WEAR?!&quot; I waited.and waited.and waited. then I freaked out. it said:&quot; Wear, sweat, shirt&quot;I literally cried out in excitement!!!!! This ghost had taste like a huge nerd like me!!!!!Theresa(:	1
Don't drag your kids out of the tent at 2am and head to dark bathroom.  Having this handy was so much better.  I had a little trouble snapping the seat on with the bag attached but it was solid when in place.  It takes up so little space and their bags with the chemicals in it really works well too.  I carry tent stakes, etc... in the 5 gal bucket anyway so the only new addition is the seat (thin and light) and the bags.	20
Pros:Great mocha taste that doesn't overpower other flavors.Lots of dark chocolate chips to satisfy chocolate cravings.One bar is very filling and satisfying.Lots of protein and fiber.Made with whole grains.Contains no high fructose corn syrup, or artificial ingredients.Very little sugar.Contains whole or nearly whole almonds versus little pieces.Cons:More expensive than some other granola bars, but very much worth it.Overall:I'd recommend these bars to anyone who enjoys the flavor of mocha.  I love these, they taste oh so good.	11
Our local hospitals have patients use this for 2 days prior to surgery and the morning of surgery to prevent MRSA and other skin infections.  I decide it was a good idea to have some on hand.  The physician recommended that we not use it regularly but only once a week or every other week and not use on face or private areas.  The pre-surgery instructions are: Shower normally then  apply a small amount of the Hibiclens to the body and extremities (about 1 ounce) wait 2 minutes and rinse off. .	12
been using mach 3 blades for years, and they work great. I've (unknowingly) bought knockoffs on ebay before, and was able to tell the difference immediately and got a refund. Since then I've been buying them on amazon, because they're cheapest here as long as you buy a decent quantity.I've tried 4-blade and 5-blade razors, and none are any better, so I haven't bothered to permanently switch.also, you can make your blades last longer by storing the blades in mineral/baby oil when not in use. It prevents the oxidation and dulling of the blades	12
I chose this item because of its design. The main part being it can be operated with one hand. So if one of your hands or arms are hurt badly in an accident, you can still get fire. It is all self contained. It was shipped very fast, and the product seems to be of high quality. I only started 2 fires with it. Both were one handed only and they started quickly. It puts out a nice LARGE pattern of sparks. You won't work for hours to get a fire if you use this item	20
Not a very bad app, but not the best. I recommend TuneIn app which has better function to find local stations, (the TuneIn app made this easy). This app did not have as comprehensive catagory functions. Display of radio stations did not always display the station's logo, which makes quick selection more of a chllenge. I did not pay for this app, I got it with the free app of the day from Amazon, I would not pay for it, there are better apps such as TuneIn to go with.	1
"I've had a lot of trouble finding a charger that will do anything but hold the battery steady on my AT&T; Captivate (a Samsung Galaxy S phone) while being used for GPS and with the screen on.. and finally, this one does it. It also does not present itself as a real USB device (many chargers show up as a ""connected computer""), which is great.Only downside for me is the fixed cord (can't substitute cords for other devices), but for the cost of this, it's well worth one per car."	7
I like how flexible the hose is but it only works for veryfine light loads like  dust from a palm sander. If you connect it to your router etc. for freehand work it will  1. loses most of it vacumm due to the small hose.  2. it'll plug up due to the small hose.Buy the adapters for your tools but convert them to a slightly bigger flexible hose e.g. 1 1/2&quot; size flex.  Also this hose is not designed to be cut shorter ( 5 feet) to improve it efficency.  The fittings on the end are part of the hose.	21
This case is the BEST. I have used it now for about a month. I love that the screen side of the phone is protected. I can toss in my purse and not worry that the screen will get damaged. I use the belt clip while at work and it has performed flawlessly. (The clip does pop off if you do not want to use it.)I have use the clip as a stand. This feature is very nice. Recently was addressing cards and found it very convenient  to use the stand and move thru my address book.Very HAPPY with my purchase!!!	7
I'm glad that amazon carries this product because I can't find it in my area anymore. I've tried many pre-shave conditioners thru the years but this works best for me. I don't really like buying 12 of these at a time but the price is right and even buying 12 is still cheaper than buying just one of some of the other products I have tried. I will share this with my son and son-in-law who both use this product too. Thanks Amazon for keeping this available to us!	12
Fun, fast playing game yet the cards could be improved by making each type a different color.Suggested age is 7+ yet my 3-year-old grasps the concept well.  If only the cards were color coded.  It is a pain sorting a stack of cards with boring / similar images all printed in black and white.Instead, we play Pit using colorful UNO cards (bright colors) and simply ignore the symbols.  All you really need are the game instructions which you can find on the company's website.	22
This is not the worst sequel for a non-Disney movie i've seen ('Swan Princess 2' and 'An American Tail III &amp; IV is much worser!), the art direction is pretty, the two leading characters are both sweet and brave, there is a lot of action, but the pro is:Cheap songs, bad character animation, some missing characters, and a confusing story.If you love classic animated non-Disney movies from the 90's, you will with guarantee love 'Secret Of NIMH 2'.	6
2pac's best album. I love his music and this album is a classic. combining gansgta rap to his angry voice. Buy this one if u r a BIG fan of 2pac. also reminds of good times with Biggie (B.I.G)I tried to get it from different stores when it came out but this album was always OUT OF STOCK finally i got it (along time ago) and It is still in my CD player. Never got out from there.For me this is the best rap album EVER! and also 2pac's greatest work.	9
I do not need to add much to the reviews of the original album, it is a classic.Legendary Producer Orrin Keepnews has been honored with a collection of Remastered CD's of the albums he has been associated with; complete with liner notes. Since I am a more recent fan of Monk, this remastering gives me a reason to buy this highly regarded cd for the first time.  The high reviews do not disappoint... and my  education of thelonius monk continues!BTW - A second version of Pannonica is not a bad thing as far as im concerned. it is a great song!	9
OMG this has got to be the smallest piece of junk I have ever paid for :) really this charger died 2 weeks after I pluged it into my car.the charger itself is made of cheap plastic,light weight and just down right worthless. the 2 weeks I had it pluged in,it never gave my phone a full charge,i drove 63 miles with it pluged into my phone and yet still did not fully charge it.guess you get what you pay for.so if you want more,then you'll have to pay more.	7

Brilliantly animated, warm and tender, this movie is one of the few greats that Bluth did before he started putting out trash. Unless you don't like animated movies and are more into snakes and spiders, you WILL fall in love  with Fievel. Tiger is also another hit. While not as lovable as Jeremy from  The Secret of Nimh, he's more lovable than Itchy from All Dogs Go to  Heaven. Some of the elements that get amplified in Bluth's more poorly  crafted movies show up in this movie, but they don't detract from the  quality of this altogether enjoyable film.	6
Although this lighthearted version of Sinatra doesn't appeal to me as much as his darker side does, there's no denying Riddle knows how to make anything swing, and the Voice delivered a tune--virtually any tune--better than jsut about anyone, save Ella Fitzgerald.And, while some of these tunes are a tad too cutesy for me, &quot;I've Got You Under My Skin&quot; is perfection, &quot;It Happened In Monterey&quot; shimmys seductively, and Sinatra's quiet approach to &quot;Anything Goes&quot; is charming.	9
This was a very interesting story within a story. A story reflecting back on the life of a man who is now in his 90's  in &#34;Assisted Living&#34;. We learn much about living a life in the Circus, especially back in the 30's....it was no picnic!! Along with tragedy we find adventure, humor and romance. I would have given the book 5 stars but for the swearing and sex content. I didn't expect that. It didn't have to be so explicit, so in my opinion the 4 star rates it a very good read!!	5
"The newest release from that trio up north is probably their best since ""Snakes and Arrows"". And yes, I know, ""Snakes and Arrows"" was their last studio release. My point is everything they make is great. Rush has such a unique sound that also appeals to a broad range of fans. I have been a fan since their release of 2112 and I have every album they have made except for a couple of their live releases. If you don't have this one yet, Rush out and get it."	6
"This is a very fun and educational game.  Players use cute trains to build ""tracks"" across the US to different cities completing a card that details what cities need to be linked to get points.  Its very easy to learn.  The only thing is that it can be complicated to score the game-we tend to do it at the end of the game rather than trying to do it during play.  This is one of the few games that is fun with just two players.  Very Entertaining! (ticket to ride Europe is also fun)."	22
I should have done the research before I started watching this series.... apparently THIS is the last season as the BBC didn't renew the show for any more seasons after this one.  I very much enjoyed the series and am disappointed that this was the end.  It was an excellent filler for me in between seasons of Downton Abbey.I am happy to say though that with the end, it didn't really leave you with any cliff-hangers... it just left you with the option to make your own ending for each of the characters.	15
I really like Stash teas; I drink it every day.  This particular flavor is very refreshing, a good combination of giner and lemon give it a nice 'zippy' taste.  I like that it is made from organic teas and ingredients, too.  That is becoming more and more important to me.  I would like to see Stash Tea offer more organic varieties.  However, it's too bad that we have to pay more in order to have fewer artificial chemicals (herbicides, pesticides and chemical fertilizers) but that's the way it is in farming currently.  This tea is definitely worth the extra cost.	11
"After a messy lesson that quinoa was too fine for my finest strainer, I went looking for something that would work. Thanks to awesome Amazon reviewers who specifically stated that quinoa would work with this strainer, I bought - and am glad I did. It works well, and is very sturdy. I posted a few pics to gauge better on size (I got the 8"") and for those curious, yes - it is dishwasher safe! (I haven't tried yet, but that's what the tag says)."	13
I got this, and it was talking away. I don't know if it is real but some things it says are just too relevant. Get it and try and see what you think. I got this one and liked it so much I moved on to the $1.99 upgrade and I am very pleased with all the extras it has. I still use this one. My friends are really interested to see it. This version is easy to use. I said some things after I asked a question, and they were right on the money. Creeepy!	1
I wasn't sure at first. It seemed a bit slow and contrived. However as it developed it becomes an entrancing puzzle with interesting characters. If there were additional season(s) I would have paid to see them if they weren't available with Prime.It has almost become the case with this show & others that the producers, if they are thinking of canceling, should first try making the content available via Amazon to see if there is an audience for the show that simply hasn't seen episode 1 due to channel clutter.	0
Don't bother! What a waste of time. On the side of the box it states what color your hair will turn out based on the color of your hair. My hair is dark brown/ black.  The turnout color would be a bright intense red, exactly what I wanted. What color did my hair come out? Dark brown/ black with a hint of red in the sunlight. Nothing like it states on the side of the box.  I pursed this product over another based on the color chart and spent extra to get it.  Won't ever buy from L'Oreal again!	4
THis game only got 4 due to the luck factor.  No matter how well you play, you could just draw bad cards everytime.  That is it.  Other than that, this is a wonderful, wonderful game.  This IS the perfect game to get people into Eurogames like Settlers of Catan and Carcassonne.  Easy to explain - 5 minutes tops.  Fast to play - 1 hour.  Good strategy.  Good theme.  You even feel like you are being educated at least a little bit in the area of US geography.Bottom Line:  Best family board game in existance.  Anyone can learn to play it relatively quickly.	22
This book hit every note for me.  Gruen had me the moment she introduced Jacob as a veterinarian and Marlena as a horsewoman.  Perfection!The adventures, the setting, the desperation of the animals, the workers and of the lovers all came together to make such a beautiful, memorable read for me. Sweet revenge and a perfect ending make this one of my top ten reads (and re-reads) time after time.  I've since recommended it to many people and it remains a favorite to this day.	5
This is a touching story of a little girl who changes her destiny to become a lady knight. This is one thing that is unheard of, and I praised Nicole for writing an excellent story which pulled me from the start.Throughout the story I could tell the author did her research thoroughly.  Strong characters paved the way from the start to the end. I always considered historic fiction to be boring, but Nicole has changed my mind.  I am looking forward to reading the next book in the series.	14
I have the Kodak DC 3400 camera - and this carry case is perfect for it.  This case is compact - but yet large enough to take everything along that I need:  extra batteries, PC cables, the camera's manual and CD disk, and a Kodak AA battery charger.It works so well with the DC 3400, it's almost as if it was made for it.  Good case for the money.To see if this case is right for you, compare your digital camera's dimensions to Kodak's DC 3400.  If the cameras are similar in size, you're all set.	10
You can use this bad boy as a base for your Wrangler's bottle jack - especially if your lift kit has put the axles a tad out of reach. If you have a Discovery, you will need to Dremel out small notch for the OEM bottle jack.  High Lift jacks are great accessories, but they're not all that safe for changing tires in the field when you think about it.  For that, a bottle jack with a good base and an axle lift point will get you going just fine.	2
This scroll saw is as advertised.  I had a lesser model that I started out on and it had a lot of vibration.  Intricate patterns were difficult to cut since the vibration would break the tiny pieces of wood.  There is NO vibration with this saw.  It is solid on its base and everything has easy access.  One item that I added was the &#34;Lifter&#34;, which I purchased separately.  It holds the arm up when changing blades or rethreading.  Dewalt should consider adding this item to the saw - it works great.	21
I live in an area with sand, not soil so I am adding it to the compost I make. It will be at least a few months before I might see any results. I just wanted to post to anyone thinking of using it in a sandy soil area w/ lots of seasonal rain, you may want to think twice about using directly on soil. Will likely percolate through before doing any good. Mix it first with a good organic media at the least. From what I have researched I expect to see good results of the product.	18
I have read just about everything this author has written and decided to read this series, even though it seemed to be very raunchy. This book isn't quite as steamy as the first book and I found that I really enjoyed it. I like the way the author develops her characters and I like the way there is no insurmountable misunderstanding. I love the way the H's always fall head over heels for the h's despite not wanting to and despite they are alpha's. I love a good romance and this author always delivers!	14
This video collection is incredible. It includes a lot of concert and behind the scenes footage, which is extremely rare,outside of this video, and the second video includes all the videos up to the Perfect Drug (except  for the original gave up and the bootleg Downward Spiral. Some of the  videos are graphic, some includiong bondage and genital torture, and much  nudity. It also has trhe uncensored closer video. You need this if you are  a NIN fan. It's incredible, even for Nine Inch Nails.	6
"This trap can actually catch mice, but if they aren't small, will only injure them.  It also leaves a wiggling tempting snack for other animals to eat, who then take the mouse AND trap to locations unknown. Trap is not selective and will kill or injure anything that trips it. The most selective and humane way to trap is to use a Havahart trap, then euthanize only the problem animals with ether (found as ""starting fluid"" in automotive stores). Ether is a potent anesthetic which was used on humans in early medical procedures. It's also extremely flammable so take great care."	18
One of my favorite Scooby-Doo movies that I like to repeat view (again and again).A Pup Named Scooby-Doo ended in 1991. The forgettable Arabian Nights movie appeared in 1993. The live action theatrical release Scooby Doo and new series What's New Scooby-Doo? would not brighten our days til 2002. Thank goodness Warner Brothers took pity on us Scooby fans and released Zombie Island in 1998!Adrienne Barbeau and Mark Hamill lend their voice talents to this excellent release. I like that they made the monsters real this time. This is an excellent first release for a new generation of fans.	6
I really like Bell's All Natural Seasoning. What I do not like is the packaging. As far as I can tell, the package has not been changed in seventy years. It is difficult to open. I think the ease with which one can spill a lot of product has some relationship to the lack of any upgrade in packaging.That said, Bell's is my favorite all-around seasoning. I transfer a package of Bell's to the Kamenstein Colored Magnetic Storage Jars, that I have also reviewed, immediately after unpacking. That seems to keep it fresher, and certainly more available for use, rather than spillage.	11
Based on the other reviews, I hoped for great flavor.  This did not deliver.  I had not made char siu for many years, but I was hoping for the char siu I had made of old.  This was a pale, pale imitation.  Next time, I'm going to use two or three envelopes and marinate for several days.  Maybe that will do the trick.  But I'm afraid I'm going to have to forget about the lazy man's solution and find my old recipe and do it from scratch.	11
A great series.  Emma Peel (Diana Rigg) was and still is the sexiest of the female martial arts heroes before or since.  Patrick McNee was in real life not too dissimilar from character John Steed but he never matched his work in this series.  Low key, tongue-in-cheek funny, pretty non-violent, and still remembered and revered today, it should be a model for TV and movies today in lieu of the pseudo-scientific, over-the-top special effects stuff we get instead.	15
I have 3 of these nic's running here at home and I also have a 10/100 4-port hub from Netgear. It was so simple to install. I tried another brand  nic first and could not get my computer to boot up on them. I took them  back and got Netgear FA-310TX. Plugged them in and it worked the first  time. I don't know about you, but I hate &quot;hard to install  hardware&quot; A great buy at Amazon... !  I need one more so I am buying  it here. Thank's Amazon	10
This was such a wonderful series. The acting was so superb. Why do series get cancelled and the trash stays on? I will never understand, but thanks to Amazon.com, I have streamed and watched every episode and will probably watch again. Yes, I know there will be a movie out next month, but that is just not the same is it? Better than nothing maybe, but this series was cancelled with so many open questions. Like ending in the middle of a sentence. It neve should have been cancelled. Such a waste.	0
First of all, this is a light duty set of tools.  If you've got a large lawn and garden to take care of, I think you'll be happier with a corded approach to electrical tools.  But I've found this perfect for my needs.  Each battery is perfectly capable of powering the blower for five minutes or so, and since you have three batteries you can clear quite a large area.  The clipper and trimmer are top notch and seem to run forever on one battery.  The blower is about half as powerful as the best corded models, but it's adequate for blowing junk over hard surfaces.	18
"There are plenty of reviews here on the performance of this dryer, which I think is fine, but I wanted to comment on it being a ""quiet"" dryer.  It ""is"" quieter than most, but my previous Conair Ionic hair dryer was 80 decibels on high, and this one is 90 decibels on high.  Anything over 80 decibels can damage your hearing, so I'm a bit disappointed in this, but again, it's still quieter than most hair dryers... but I would have thought the ""newer"" dryer would have been even more quiet."	4
These are expensive for daily use, I'd recommend NiMH rechargeables for that, but they're perfect for low temperature use (car flashlight in Minnesota winter, digital camera use outdoors in the winter) when both alkalines and NiMHs fail to deliver. These would also be, with very gradual storage loss, great for an emergency electronic device. Maybe for GPS or LED flashlight. Do check that your electronics are happy with these batteries installed. I've heard of both digital cameras and GPS units (Garmin GPS60) that did not.	12
This is my second Fender Polish Cloth. They are basic, but that's all I need for a quick wipe down of my instrument after I'm done playing. The only slight negative is the fact that they tend to unravel around the edges. Even though this has happened to me, it didn't keep me from buying the second one. The fact that they are basic and inexpensive is good enough for me. It gets softer with time and use. Overall I have to say that I'm satisfied with the Fender Polish Cloth.	16
We've had these headphones for about 8 years until the kids finally finished them off when trying them.These headphones are great for using in gym. They designed in the way that the pressure is distributed between your ears and your scull so that they are fixed firmly when you're jogging.The sound quality is simply amazing for their price. The design looks sort of dated but that's because they've been produced without change for more then 25 years now.I've bought the same model now to replace the broken once.Highly recommend.	10
"Larks Tongues in Aspic is the third King Crimson album you should buy (RedandIn the Court of the Crimson Kingshould be your first and second purchase, in that order). This album features the classic Crimson tune ""Easy Money,"" as well as the two part ""Larks Tongues in Aspic."" Like most Crimson albums, each track is rather lengthy, with the exception of the short (2:56) ""Book of Saturdays."" This can only be a good thing, since there's more music to love. I highly recommend this album for any progressive rock fan, or for anyone exploring the King Crimson experience."	6
"This book (book 4 in the series) was slower than the other three, but still excellently written.  Many of the main characters spend the majority of the book moping (Dany & Jon Snow), or drifting fairly aimlessly (Tyrion & Mormont).  Stannis and his ""queens men"" finally leave the wall, but barely.  They encounter no Lannisters to advance that plot.I'm still re-reading it (read it as it came out, then reread the other 3, and then it again), and enjoying it, but I wish it had progressed the story a lot farther."	5
I have never had a sander like this before, but when I was refinishing a desk for a lady , I decided to get one. I compared several other units and decided on this one. I love the variable speed and with a course grit belt, it made light work of the 3 coats of paint I had to remove. it is very maneuverable  and the dust catcher works great also.  I used a light grit belt and some light hand sanding  for the polyurethane finish and the lady's words were: &#34;you turned my old desk into a thing of beauty&#34;  .	21
Take The Money & Run is the first film that featured the Woody Allen triple threat of writing, directing and starring.  The film is set as a documentary on the life of the worst criminal of all-time, Virgil Starkwell, who never pulled off a successful crime in his life.  The film is a fast-paced and sharply written.  It sets up the Woody Allen persona, the likable loser, that he would portray in most of his subsequent films.  Take The Money & Run is an excellent start to a movie legend's fabled career.	15
I have read most of this author's books. I simply love, love, love the Westmoreland family series and their wonderful heroines/heros/loves. The Westmoreland men and the few Westmoreland women are each, in their own right, riveting characters. Although they're all extremely manly/womanly, there's no fear in expressing their feelings! Emotions are always expressed, no matter the situation whatever it is. The emotions consistently pour! Again, I love, love, love the Westmoreland Clan. Keep'em coming Brenda as I love you as one of my very favorite authors too.	14
This is a lovely wall mount for your guitar. Comes with everything you need (except a drill or a screwdriver of course). It is pretty and very strong. I originally purchased it to hang on drywall (sheetrock) for my 5 year old's mini guitar but once I had it mounted I found that it is strong enough to hold MY ELECTRIC guitar, which is quite heavy and that is amazing to me because usually that kind of weight would pull a mount right out of the sheetrock. This is a good buy.	16
I love Perky-Pet feeders, but they should be ashamed of themselves for selling this. They do not need artificial anything, especially food coloring! All you need to do is bring 4 parts water to a boil, and 1 part white sugar, let boil a couple of minutes and let it cool. If you are too lazy to do this, you shouldn't be feeding hummers. It only takes a few minutes, and you can make more and store it in the fridge for up to 2 weeks. Hummingbirds also get their nutrition from real flower nectar, and small insects.	18
Strong, stable, stackable, 'nestable' - these boxes have it all... except labels.  Would be nice if Akro included a few labels for the front... they do, but they want you to pay for them, so I'll just cut out some card stock.  These also can mount to the Akro wall-system which is nice, and may be the way I build my next garage work bench.  Currently they're sitting on the bench stacked 3 high.  I liked them so much I placed a second order!	13
Levi's jeans remain a reliable and consistent staple. This Levi's Men's 505 Straight (regular) fit jean retains quality fabric and classic styling. The legs are not too narrow or too wide. The design is comfortable, classy, and no-nonsense. These jeans are versatile, and can be dressed up or down. We personally can not abide passing fashion trends, with guys wearing girlfriend-style jeans, or rolled-up cuffs. In contrast, Levi's jeans are cool and timeless, like the Rolling Stones and ZZ Top. They work for men whether urban or country. Enjoy!	8
When my newborn was in her Co-Sleeper, changing wet bedding every morning was no big deal -- but a move to the crib meant a HUGE daily struggle to disassemble the bumper, manhandle the mattress and strip the sheet and mattress pad, then reverse the whole process after washing and drying. The Ultimate Crib Sheet is truly that: just undo a few snaps and toss it in the wash. It's soft and durable, and your expensive bedding and mattress pad stay fresh and dry. In hindsight, wish I'd had several of these on my registry.	3
Although it is touted for acoustic guitars, it works well with my Ibanez Electric as well as my dreadnaught and acoustic/electric. The spring is tough and it holds securely. On and off is a quick process if you have the hand/finger strength to operate it. I rate it 4 stars only because I just received it and haven't had a chance to use it much. But, I like it so far. It was delivered quickly. It does the job. I'll update after I've had it for awhile.	16
I love this hair towel.  It seems silly to have a towel specifically for your hair, but this thing allows me to dry my hair in a nice tight package.  And it definitely pulls more water from my hair than a traditional towel.  I'm buying a couple more for traveling, my gym bag, etc.Regarding the people who complain about the fit, I wonder if twisting it more or less would adjust the fit for your... more twisting and it's going to be tighter, less twisting and it's going to be looser.	4
"Trivia:  You can't have a sewer hose on the ground in Oregon.  It must be elevated!Betcha didn't know that, but what the heck!  It's always nice to have your ""stuff"" run downhill into the dump station instead of just sitting there in the hose!  Some people (Joe Flatlanders) carry a rain gutter to accomplish the same thing, but is a rain gutter collapsible into a nice little package with a handle?Word to the wise:  NEVER leave you black tank gate valve open!  It's ok to leave your gray tank open but NEVER leave your blank tank valve open!"	2
One of the best truly portable headphones you can get. Perfect for portable devices if you don't mind looking a little geeky with it's 80's styling. The next step up would be Grado SR60 or Sony MDR-v6 (which i own) but those are a lot bulkier and more expensive.It has very strong bass for its size. The only thing I would change is a better quality wire that lasts longer. On the plus side, it does have the Koss lifetime warranty (just pay the shipping).	10
This model is such a space saver for my small changing table. It's very strong and easy to hook on the sides of the table (make sure that the edge of your changing table is not too wide though and be aware when you want to put  any wipe warmer on the top tray. Most of them don't fit inside the tray. It just fits regular wipe boxes.  And the side containers also don't fit very large bottle of baby powder or lotion). I still highly recommend it though.	3
I read and enjoyed the prequel to this book, Lover Awakened, so I thought I would try this shorter e-pub. It was good!As a new father, Z must come to terms with his past so he can embrace fatherhood, and baby Nella, without fear. Tender scenes with Z, Bella, and Nella. Sizzling sex, too.SPOILER -----I was expecting the visit to the dermatologist / plastic surgeon to end differently. Usually, in most romances, everything gets tied up in a pretty bow, but that gets old. This seemed more authentic.	14
Definitely Nick Drake's most mainstream release in his all too brief discography, Bryter Layter is filled with more somber guitar lines, Nick's expressive vocals, and even drums/flutes/other instruments! Wow!Those elements are a turn off for those who like more of his raw and unpolished music, but a lot of the songs on this album are just as emotional as those on Pink Moon or 5 Leaves Left, though some of the songs can do without the overproduction.Still worthy of a listen, and of a purchase.	9
"As always Ms. Hill directs out thoughts to how to handle a difficult situation with grace and pride. After hearing her ""mother and sister"" saying spiteful things about her. Patty immediately leaves her home and is fortunate enough to find a position as a companion. Her loving and kind personality comes through in everything she does and she is rewarded for it with the trust and love of the family and meeting the man who is her perfect match.Ms. Hill's books are always touching and inspiring, I've been reading them for almost 50 years and they never lose their charm or meaning."	14
My cats enjoy eating Wellness Chicken and Herring (they didn't like the turkey). I like giving them a high quality food. But when I ordered a case several of the cans were badly dented so I did not use them. Not from shipping, because the dented cans were not on the outside of the pack but on the inside which means someone deliberately packed dented cans. This defeated my goal of saving money by ordering online. It is better for me to buy them from the store so I can be sure the cans aren't damaged.	19
I ordered some old fashioned suspenders, the kind construction workers use to hold up heavy tool belts.  2 inches wide and made with heavy duty metal hardware.  I also ordered a small set of make-up brushes for my daughter.  I ordered them with free shipping through prime.  What I did not expect when I ordered these on a week day evening was rhat they would be delivered in less than 24 hours...free of charge! (with my prime membership).  GREAT service from Amazon and ace hardware direct.	8
For well over a year, I have been using different types of hot sauce on different types of food.  Before I started doing this, I only ever remember using hot sauce on barbeque sandwiches.  Even though I have tried numerous types of hot sauce during this period, Tabasco Brand Chipotle Pepper Sauce has set itself apart from the others.  Tabasco Brand Chipotle Pepper Sauce is hotter than most hot sauces that I like, but I do not consider it to be an overpowering heat.  It is a good, nice-tasting hot sauce to have around, and I recommend it.	11
"Haven't had this long, but so far, it's just about perfect. I had bought another On-Stage side boom earlier and was greatly disappointed by its flimsiness (On-Stage MY550 - see review). This one on the other hand is rock solid and much more adjustable, AND only costs a few bucks more (fourteen buckos at present). I've got a 13"" gooseneck and a light-ish condenser mic with a shock-mount on it, and it's as steady as can be. I'm convinced even heavier loads will be no problem. If you're in need of a side boom, look no further."	16
I like this headset. It is very comfortable and lightweight. Stays on fine when adjusted properly. The volume is great. Callers say they can hear me fine without noise interference. What I like best is You can close it to turn it off an open it and it automatically reconnects. You can answer call waiting with this too. Also I haven't had it randomly disconnect as I turn my head as my other one did. I don't know about battery life yet as i only have had it 3 days.	7
"I wish CTV would consider reissuing ""Sesame Street"" as a chronological series, starting with ""Season One,"" and working their way to the present... I would love to see the old episodes as they were originally broadcast, not with a few select bits chopped up into the new, modern mix. The old shows were so wonderful... plus that awful, whiny Elmo was nowhere to be seen!  Anyway, that's my wish as a Sesame Street kid who now has a kid of my own...PS - yay, Sesame Street!"	15
Yeah, you could spend an hour cutting up old t-shirts and save some money.  And end up with irregular shapes, loose strings, etc.  For a few bucks, you get a supply that will last a lifetime for some folks.  Even if you shoot often, 500 patches is going to last you a LONG time.  You could pay this much for a tiny bag of patches at a sporting goods store.  Good deal, exp. coming from the iconic name in gun cleaning.	20
If you've never tried a stick vac, I highly recommend them.  Super great for quick pick-ups or a run-thru when company is coming.  I have owned several stick vacs over the years but this one tops them all.  The extra battery comes in handy and the clear top makes it easy to see when the brush needs cleaned.  Hang this near your mess area and make clean up quick and life simple.  It does a great job on hard surface flooring or carpeting.	13
It is the third Iris container I have. One is for cat food. The other one is for my bread flour. This third one I needed for dog food. It is sturdy, it closes tight, and it holds a Costco-sized bag of dog food without any problems. Also, it is easy to move around on sturdy casters. Last but not least: it is still quality made in the USA. I am sure this will not be the last of Iris containers I buy. I am very happy with the purchase.	19
I bought this because it came in as the top spinner on one of those cooking sites. Although I like it a lot, it does tend to bounce around on the countertop (I have granite so maybe that's the reason). From the previous testing, I expected it to stay put better. Also, I honestly don't think it gets my greens as dry as my old hand-crank spinner. But it's larger than what I had so it's a keeper. I just have to spin more and then lay the greens on a paper towel for a bit.	13
This RIO model is a nifty music device.  Compact size, fantastic sound quality, no skipping, and easy transfer of music from a computer.  On the other hand, it only holds six or seven songs, the door on the battery case  doesn't stay shut so well after a few months of use, and a little abuse,  and the &quot;hold&quot; switch gets sticky after a while and becomes  difficult to move.  If you can find it on the cheap it's a cool toy,  otherwise wait for a newer model or get some other technology to fire up  your tunes.	10
Words really can describe how wonderful this game is. The first thing you will notice is the incredible graphics (note: a 3D card is not required!.) Everything is drawn in great detail right down to character traits and facial expressions (who would have thought a fleshless person would be so good with expressions.) The story is also very entertaining and added with the graphics, it makes this a very absorbing adventure. This is one of the few games that I can't say anything negative about. This is a must have!	23
I just needed this to organize clutter such as note pads, discs for my computer, take-out menus, tape, etc. This is slightly larger than I expected. I need to keep it off to the side of my desk instead of on it. It does work as a simple separator, but bends VERY easily. It came with nearly every separator bent out of place, and only took a slight push to bend them back. I suppose this can be good if you want to add a slant, but it can't hold any weight.	17
I got this for the crawl space under my parents cabin.  I wanted something safe for when the kids are playing, but strong enough to chase away critters.  My parents are mostly concerned about skunks and the occasional groundhog or woodchuck.The odor is strong and peppery, but much better than skunk spray.  I think you have to stay on top of applciations because the damp soil/earth will probbaly reduce the potency.So far so good and it seems to be doing its job.  I wish it were a little less expensive, but then again professionals are much more expensive.	18
It costs less than the OXO Spinner (the rounder shape--the one we had for years, but the bottom finally cracked and we needed to replace it after 8 or 10 years or so) and it looks so much nicer.  The plastic is much denser and clearer, it takes up less room in the fridge, and is deinitely nice enough to use as a salad serving bowl as well.  Love this thing! And it feels so sturdy and well made, I think it will last a really long time.	13
I loved this season of 24. I loved almost everything about it, even the death scenes. I felt like nobody was safe, and anybody could die! I especially loved the episode where everyone is trapped in C.T.U. with the nerve gas everywhere. I also loved the surprise ending with Jack being taken hostage by the Chinese who were still after Jack from season 4. I highly recommend this season to all fans of 24. And I just saw the season six trailer. I've watched it over three times and I can't wait.	0
You know the drill: use drill, leave it somewhere, need drill, go find drill. repeat. Problem solved with this holster. Well built, sturdy, fits every drill I've put into it. Has a stap which goes over the handle which keeps drill from falling out when you're crawling around. I am absolutely pleased with this rig, it's handy, and has cut down on my aggravation level has my drill is always on hand. I feel the same way about Bucket Boss Tool Bags too!	21
Billy Ocean fused R&amp;B/soul with pop/rock and ended up with an excellent album. &quot;Carribean Queen&quot; and &quot;Loverboy&quot; are both must-have 80's hits, and this album is the best place to hear them, because the versions here are much longer than the radio edits on his greatest hits CD! But then again, every song on this album is great, and the heartfelt cover of the Beatles' &quot;Long and Winding Road&quot; should win over people who don't normally appreciate 80's music. But if you are a fan of the 80's, you definitely need this album, and if you aren't, get it anyway!	9
I love lime perrier but it is very expensive so I thought I would give this a shot. It is super- fizzy - more like Perrier than Poland or the Store Brand. Lime flavor is very subtle - not over-the-top and not artificial tasting at all. No weird aftertaste. I am not thrilled that it is in a can but it is very convenient - perfect size for single serving or to pack with your lunch. Price on amazon with the subscribe and save discount is insanely good. Will reorder.	11
For those of you wanting a good Flight sim.  Turn to Jane's.I am a Hardcore Flight Simmer.  Flight Sims even convienced me to join the NAVY AVIATION.  But this game's graphics are rather sad.  I mean I have a serous  system 600MHZ P3, 128MB ram, 32MB VideoRAM Nvida GeForce card.  Well enough  about my system.  Back to the game.  The Flight modeling is good but the  Game in the nicest way possible Sucks.  Spend your money on F/A-18, Usaf,  or Flanker 2.0 if you are a hardcore flight simmer looking for a new game  for the arsenal.  Take my Military Honor on it.	23
This is a lovely puzzle. The image is fun and the pieces go together very well. The size is just right for little hands too! The box is great too - I opened the top flap and my daughter had fun putting the pieces away. The rope handle makes it easy for her to lug it around too.However, it's lower quality and more expensive than other brands such as Ravensburger. It's going to get beat up faster - the pieces were easily bent and just in shipping some of the pointier corners were bumped up.	22
A rich heiress ( Gemma Atherton) is kidnapped by two ex-convicts and a ransom demand of 2 million pounds is made. Most of the plot, if revealed, will lead you think' Haven't I seen this movie' but leave these assumptions aside as this movie is a twister with turns happening at every interval and the balance of power shifting between the kidnapper and the kidnapped. This is a very difficult movie to review because writing about the plot would give a lot away. Still, it is a treat to watch. Three stars. 2/3/11	0
The fit was excellent, the pants work well for my husband's job with one slight problem:  they show every speck of dirt  when he's on a job site and it clings to the fabric used in the manufacturing of the pants.  Not sure there is much they can do about this since the durability of the fabric is fantastic and the overall look professional, just wish the dust/dirt wouldn't cling so well despite attempts at brushing it off.  The pants must be washed every night.	8
"This is my 4th bluetooth headset, and it is by far the best working headset. It is clear. I can hear while driving, people can hear me like I am talking into the phone.My one complaint is that it doesn't fit well on my ear. If they had made the ear loop another 1/4"" I would be giving this 5 stars. Instead it never feels exactly right, and ends up hurting my ear if I wear it for extended periods.I'm keeping it, but I am looking for a different way to attach it to my ear."	7
This is without a doubt the best smelling hand soap in the world. The green apple scent smells just like green apple jolly ranchers. You'll want to wash your hands even more, just so you can smell this awesome fragrance. Until i recently discovered the touchless soap dispensers I had this on every sink in my house....and as soon as i figure out the right formula to use this in a touchless dispenser...I'll be right back on the Mrs Meyer's green apple band wangon! LOVE IT!!!!	4
Simply put, Code Veronica is the best in the series.  After RE2 I didn't think the series could get any better but I was wrong.  CV had an amazing graphics and a superb camera system.  The story was HUGE and awesome so this was the most time consuming RE at the time.  I think the remake of RE on the Gamecube is longer (and 10 times scarier than the PSX version).  If you have a Gamecube or DC and love adventure/action/horror games than Code Veronica and the rest of the series is definately for you.	23
I've had my B&D Pole Pruning Saw for 1 week now.  I bought this based solely on comments made on this site by people in the review. They did not disappoint.  This is a nice product. I've used it 3 times now and it cut though all branches smoothly. It is lightweight and very well made.  Before I bought this I used the Woodzig Pole saw. That is not in the same league. The B&D is far superior.  I think you will be very satisfied as I am with this product.	18
"We have been using Scotch brand tape products for decades but not, until now, have we used this product. It is difficult to rate it because of infrequent need but on the one occasion we have used it thus far, it did all that we had hoped it would. If the item remains firmly attached after a month or so, I will add a star to my rating. Meanwhile, perhaps other uses will emerge. Tests and evaluations continue.Meanwhile, again, I say ""Thank You"" to the Amazonians for the Vine Program."	17
This app is awesome.. Not a moon pro so cant point out any off details but since I'm sure they will be worked out I know this app is a keeper! Kudos to the brain who thought this up and made it happen.. This app has given me a renewed interest, and this app will likely be another bed time ritual. . the experimental DSS looks great on my K fire, graphics awesome, details and info awesome! Thanks for the freebie, gotta love the educational apps... grreeeaat.	1
Buddy Guy is one of the top blues guitar man.The others are Jimi Hendrix,Gary Moore,SRV... In my opinion,this cd is his best work.You must put this at cdplayer,and hear as loud as you can,so you'll be in tune with  one of the most energetic,consistent,emotional blues sets ever recorded.  Buddy's vocal tunes are sensually incendiary,with the combination of right  music choices,resulting this great album,with explosive interpretation of  Mustang Sally,and passionate in all other tracks. I really recomend this  'Dam'n right...',one of my best favorites in my collection	9
I like hiking with my dog and purchased this collapsible bowl for our outdoor excursions.I also use it whenever I take him to the vet or in the car. Dogs over heat in this weather very quickly, carrying water is essential.This bowl is handy and easy to slip into your pocket, just put it on a flat surface and fill it with water or food.My dog hasn't gotten the opportunity to chew it because I take it away as soon as he's finished.This is one of the more sturdier bowls I've found and I'm very satisfied with it.	19
Despite the age recommendation that this is for an 8yo, we bought it for my 5yo daughter because she loves her &#34;bones book&#34; and is pretty good about repeating back the right words for bones and organs.  Plus the &#34;squishy&#34; nature of the organs makes her laugh.  The pieces are a little flimsy though, and some of the bones don't snap back into the plastic &#34;body shell&#34; like they should, and they fall out.  Overall it's a good learning tool and she loves it.	22
I've always loved peel-off masques. That's really because I enjoyed the peel-off process. However, I considered them ineffective because the only thing they'd get rid of are my baby hairs at the front, nothing more. But this is one masque that does the trick! I constantly looking forward to applying it and seeing the difference it makes it closing my pores and getting rid of my acne. My face is so much more radiant and alive! This is definitely a product I'm sticking to.	4
We have a white crib and the last set of these I bought (years ago) were discolored. These are clear, and look and fit great on our crib. You should definitely measure the width and thickness of the area you want to protect though. I know some people did not, and wrote poor reviews about it when it was clearly buyer error. Our son figured out how to remove the other ones we had, but not these. So far, our nice crib is saved, hopefully for baby #2.	3
Defying Gravity is an awesome show that mixes the foreseeable future with an alien sci-fi twist.  It's all about mystery with flashbacks to see where the characters have come from and how far they have gone.  The whole show left me on the edge of my seat and I have since re-watched the show many times over.  Its great to watch at the end of a day.  Anyway, if you're a space fan and love mystery, this is the show for you.  This show was sadly cancelled before its time.  Have no fear in buying this gem.	0
"This is one of the better tasting Senseo pods out there, but it is not Kona coffee.  It contains only 10% Kona coffee, the other 90% is something else.  If you want Kona coffee, go buy Kona coffee.  This Kona ""blend"" won't taste anything like it.Names aside, as I stated this is one of the better tasting Senseo pods.  Four stars are based on rating Senseo coffee.  It would get less stars if I was just rating ""coffee""."	11
"I'm crazy about these blades, blades that perform exactly as promised. I made some cuts with my Bosch jigsaw using regular blades. Then I switched blades and made cuts in the same materials with the Progessor blades. I was awed. The cuts were easy, fast, and smooth. I even made some cuts in the wooden garden ties picked up from Home Depot. I usually cut these with my chain saw. The ties were no obstacle for my Bosch jigsaw armed with Progressor blades.I've used these blades on plywood, planks, garden ties, and 2"" PVC pipe with equal success."	21
I bought this from a local retailer since it was the only one in stock, and was so disappointed I returned it. It made sherbet (milk-based) with no problem at all, but I've really been craving sorbet, and the freezer bucket simply wasn't cold enough to do the job--it chilled my mix, but didn't even turn it to slush before it had warmed... at which point I had no choice but to put the bucket back in the freezer for another 9 hours, only to repeat the cycle several times before giving up.	13
I found the development of this series to be ponderous in the beginning; the saving grace is Helen Mirren who is unable to comfortably smoke a cigarette. This and the slow development of the plot make for a less than delightful series. I don't know if I will go on to watch the second episode. I probably will and I do want the series to elevate itself in my mind. This is a contemporary series, which I don't usually watch but I think I am willing to give it a second chance.	0
"No matter what controversy Paula Abdul tends to generate these days, there used to be a time when she was much more well-respected, and rightly so with this high-energy, hits-heavy album. ""Straight Up"" and ""Forever Your Girl"" are two songs that really say ""bring back the 80s"". A lot of people said that she had no singing talent, and while I can agree on the fact that her whiny, nasal wail is not the most pleasant singing voice that somebody could've been blessed with, she still knows how to sing with energy and passion."	9
These shoes are not just hype, they are everything te say and then a lot more. They look great, fell great and are buit to last, I usualy go through a pair of shoes every 6 months (give or take) praticing capoeira, name brand shoes, generic shoes, I go through the soles, rip open the front pont where your toes are,  none have withstood as much as these. They are going on a year now and they look like they can last another year,  easy. Highly recomend them, the sole is padded for great comfort and performance.	20
I bought this to use in homemade body butter because I wanted the butter to be good for hands and nails too.  It works great with the body butter and I had enough left over to use straight on my nails.  I really like it and I think it is helping with the peeling on my nails.  It is a little early to really determine that but I have noticed less peeling lately.  The only change is the body butter and the jojoba oil so I suspect it has played a part in healthier nails.	4
"The small size of these beautiful gold hoops makes them one of the most versatile earrings I own: they can be simple (for work), casual (with jeans and a sweater), or elegant (with a dress, if I want to keep the look low-key, or if I'm wearing a ""statement"" necklace requiring other jewelry to be minimal.)My one problem,resulting in the loss of one star, is that one of the clasps is so tight that it's difficult open and close the earring.  In hindsight, I should have returned them for another pair."	8
"overall, this is a pretty good album with a few outstanding cuts. ""Outta Here"", ""I Can't Wake Up"", and ""Mortal Thought"" are all fairly entertaining tracks that showcase KRS-One's gifted delivery and his creative flow. but the production of this record sounds dated and alot of the songs toward the end of the record are forgettable. i prefer the hardcore leanings of his BDP days rather than these semi-concious psuedo-ragga party jams. but KRS's voice is still a treat to listen to and this record is probably better than almost any other hip hop album put out in 1993."	9
I love this leave-in conditioner and it's so hard to find! Glad to get it in an &#34;add-on&#34; deal. I'm a lap swimmer and have colored and highlighted hair but don't like wearing swim caps. Instead, I wet my hair and spritz this into it, so my hair is saturated and the chlorinated water rolls off. At least, I'm hoping that's what happens! My hair stylist suggested I do this and my color seems to last as long as it should.	4
We have had this model for over a year and, while it does make good coffee, it is SUCH a pain to clean.  You have to remove the entire grinding/ filter mechanism each and every time coffee is made.  Also, the grounds somehow wind up going everywhere and the water reservoir must be cleaned at least every 2 or 3 pots in order to keep the grounds out of your water.  If I had it to do over again I'd spend the extra money and buy the Capresso machine.  My mother has the Capresso and it's much better!	13
"THERE IS NOTHING THAT WILL GIVE YOU PAUSE, CAUSE YOU TO CRINGE, OR HOLD YOUR BREATH MORE THAN HAVING A LARGE ""CHUNK"" OF MATERIAL GET SUCKED INTO YOUR DUST COLLECTION SYSTEM.NOT HAVING THE ABILITY TO SHUT DOWN THE BLOWER INSTANTLY, ONE TENDS TO CRINGE UNTIL THE INEVITABLE SOUND OF DESTRUCTION IS HEARD EMANATING FROM THE BLOWER HOUSING.

I like the Diaper Champ.  My little boy's room doesn't stink from dirty diapers.  I empty it once a week, when it is time for trash pick-up.  I like the fact of using regular trash bags instead of having to buy special bags.  I do wipe it down a couple of times a month.  I have also put in a box of baking soda to help absorb the odors inside.  I highly recommend this product.  It is very easy to drop in your dirty diapers.	3
It sprays water but the cats just walk beyond the area that gets sprayed. They don't seem to care.They (I have two) have a tendency to break. The settings dial never worked properly, and even when turned off for four weeks somehow ate the battery.Animals must be large, probably raccoon or bigger. Definitely doesn't go off for birds or squirrels (though butterflies immediately in front of the sensor sometimes did.) For me it is a source of aggravation and would probably serve me better used as a projectile.	18
This is a good stand that can be used for both electric and acoustic guitars. The upper brace has an interesting way of securing the guitar neck making it unlikely your instrument will topple over. The stand can be used with or without the upper brace. On mine, the wheel that locks the upper brace in place is not as locking as I'd like it to be. Also, the &#34;feet&#34; don't spread as wide apart as I'd hoped. A few more inches would have been appreciated. All in all, a good but not &#34;perfect&#34; stand.	16
"The stock headlight and bulb in my Harley are just okay.  I put this bulb in and the light went from ""on the border of"" yellow to very white with a hint of blue.  I went down a dark, unlit road the other day and flipped on the brights - WOW!  Be sure your headlight is aimed right, because these things project out much farther than your old standard bulb.  We'll see how long they last on a rumbling Harley with a stiff suspension, but so far I'd recommend them if you can get them for around $50."	2
Fantastic gate extremely easy to install.  There are no little places where kids can get their fingers pinched so I feel safe closing it even when my extremely curious and active 8 month old is crawling and climbing on it.  it's a tall gate so i don't worry about her going over it at all and it takes force to push the step down but easy to do.  Buy it for the entrance to hallways or in doorways where you want the door open sometimes but don't want babies in and out of that room.	3
I discovered Dr. Bronner's soap pin my local food co-op when I was a student- more years ago than I care to admit. I can only echo what others say: It's the perfect all around hand soap, bath soap and dish soap. I buy it in gallon jugs, attach a pump (available at any good hardware store) and transfer it into quart containers for the bath, pint containers for travel, and hand dispensers for the bathroom and kitchen sink. A gallon lasts close to a year in my household- just remember, as the Doctor says: Dilute! Dilute! Dilute! ;-)	20
This game was a bit of a let down compared to its predacessor, Final Fantasy VI (US III).  It's still a good game, the second best one from the three released for PS (IX is the best of the PlayStation era).  The dark realism pioneered by this game made for a good story, and was much more well done than Final Fantasy VIII.  The addition of FMV for the first time was also a nice new element.  However, the gameplay and story still fall short of Final Fantasy VI and IX.  Worth a play, especially since the price is good now.	23
I've tried every blackening product out there, Black-Magic, Armor All, Meguiar's, and even my own concoction and none work as well as this. Not only that, it lasts about 3-4 weeks outside in the weather, which I find amazing.Also it seems like the more you use it, the better it looks and the longer it stays black. Plus it has a pleasant smell, which is always nice.The only complaint I have is that it is a bit runny, which can make applying it a bit hard, but it's still worth every cent.A must have for anyone with black trim/molding!	2
It does the job, but does it make the loudest noise doing it.  My husband said it sounded like I was milking a cow.  I would have opted using a double breast pump, but it was much more pricier.  After two months I found that it was harder to express breast milk using the same suction as before.  I don't know why.  The pump was fine and working the same, even at the highest level, my breast would not fully be expressed.  I had to just ditch this item in the end.	3
This sander seems to work much, much better than the Dewalt.  The dust collection seems to be better (not as much dust flying around in the air while using it) and it does not get as hot as the Dewalt.  Also there are not any consumables on this sander  that you're going to have to buy.  With the DeWalt, there is an O-ring that needs replacing every once in while for its dust collection.  Better yet, the base takes either 5 or 8 hole sanding discs.  Much better sander with regard to operation, dust collection, and cost.	21
I'm your average weekend woodworker.  Over the last thirty years, I've accumulated quite a collection of clamps, ranging from twin-screw wooden monsters down to miniature c-clamps.  Since I bought a couple (now up to five!) of these recently, they have become my first choice when I need to clamp something.  They generate more than enough force for most purposes and are strong and easy to adjust...just slide the jaw forward and a twist of the handle locks it in place.Unlike similar clamps offered by a different vendor, these have plastic pads on both jaw surfaces.  Highly recommended.	21
Got these for work (Work as a Paramedic), so these do its job by being somewhat water-proof, good fit, and durable. They come super starchy, the size runs pretty small. (I'm a 34 in most everything, a 34 in this seems to feel like a 32 or even 30 at times). Depending on what you want of a work pant, this gets the job done, but just not that great of quality and will probably be thrown away after some use in a year or so.	8
This inflatable tub was perfect! A good size, no frills, and a suction cup that worked well for mounting it to the shower wall when we were finished using it. It worked great, until we started noticing slow leaks. We'd super glue one, only to find another a few weeks later. Time to buy a new tub.*Update - all the other tubs have the same negative reviews about splitting seams over time. Since this tub worked so well for us until it split and we love the suction cup, we just bought another one. Ah well.	3
We are new to Hansen's Sparkling Water, but we really love it.  Each flavor has a clean taste and a moderate amount of fizz.  That way, you don't feel like you're drinking soda, more like....well, natural sparkling water.  We love the flavor and love having a great way to pull away from the sugary sodas.  Having tasted a few of Hansen's flavors in the Sparkling Water, we are now big fans.  PS:  getting these delivered in auto shipments from Amazon is THE BEST!	11
This router is one of 4 that I own.  It's only 6 months old, but has quickly become my favorite.  It has plenty of power for anything I've asked of it though I use my 3.5 HP table router for big bits.  I mostly use it with a dovetail jig.  The tried and true twist-the-motor depth adjustment is quick and easy.  It's not too top-heavy and tippy like a plunge router.  The D-Handle with trigger switch looks awkward, but works extremely well in practice.  It's not loaded with bells and whistles, but simply works well.	21
"I have been a faithful user of D'Addario strings since a well meaning obsession-starter recommended them to me at a local music store.  Compared to other brands of nickel strings that I've used, these ones just feel ""cleaner"" than the others. They have a clearer sound, and seem to hold their tune better than most.If you're looking for acoustic strings, you can't beat the phosphorus bronze for warmth and clarity.  But if you're looking for electrics that are reasonably priced and sound clean, look no further."	16
...but I love having quality gear. I don't use this knife to fix tanks or fight for our country- but you couldn't ask for a better camping/survival knife, even just for a regular joe. The craftsmanship and quality of this knife is apparent from the moment you open the box. I am among those who actually enjoys the nylon sheath, and I especially like the multi-tool pouch in which I can store my SOG PowerAssist. If my multi-tool is elsewhere it's a great place for a sharpener or other supplies.Big thumbs up to SOG!	20
1. Madness is pop fun with loud horns  2. &quot;Wings of a Dove&quot; (A Celebratory Song) is a wonderful Caribbean-sounding blast  3. &quot;One Step Beyond&quot; is a ska materpiece 4. &quot;Micheal Caine&quot; is a twisted delight  5. Madness completely trancends its '80s roots  6. That said, &quot;Our House&quot; is a dance classic  7.  Unlike a lot of 80's stuff (like most Time-Life collections) this is disc is nicely remastered  8. If you have only heard &quot;Our House,&quot; you're in for a treat - Madness is so much more than a one-hit wonder  9. It's goofy  10. It's fun	9
Since I bought the sequel, I guess I enjoyed it. I found myself comparing it to Juster`s Phantom Tollboth and thinking Phantom  was better. But I found that I liked the Langman characters enough to care about them, and the plot interesting enough to wonder what happens next. Tollbooth may be a masterpiece, but so far Logic is a pretty fun read.  At this point I`d give Logic a 92 on a scale where Phantom Tollbooth was 100.  That`s pretty good; I`ll read the sequel next and review it to let y`all know if  made a mistake.	14
does exactly what it is supposed to do. as a child i watched my grandmother use the old fashioned peeler. she could and did peel apples do the skin came off in one long  sheet. she wasn't showing off. she just had the mastery of the tool. when i needed a peeler, i automatically went with the same old fashioned peeler. i'm not sure when i finally had the chance to use one of these &#34;european&#34; peelers. they are perfect. they do exactly what a peeler is supposed to do, peel stuff quickly and easily. with emphasis on easy.	13
&#34;What is thaaaat?!?&#34; That was the shriek exclaimed by my 2.5 y/o when she opened this up on Christmas! She is so super excited about this purse set... She loves the credit card, phone and &#34;Chapstick (lipstick)&#34; the most. The size of the enclosed items are. Perfect for a toddler. The price was really good, too. We are definitely very happy with this purchase. Oh, for those who may care, the mirror that came with her set was yellow vs the shown blue, just FYI.	8
This was actually part of the Dragon Knight series but introduced some characters that would be beneficial to the upcoming books in that series.  If you are looking for hot sex then this has it but it also has a great story line and introduces characters that become common place as the Dragon Knights series progresses.  The young woman in this book was of strong character although a little lost and we actually saw some flaws in the Dragon Knights she becomes involved with.  I liked where the author took this story and look forward to more in this series.	14
I love OXO products for the most part but this product just is not well designed.  It does open larger jars but it is clumsy and difficult to use. My husband and I have arthritis and I was hoping this opener would open twist off soda or water bottles that always seem to give us trouble.  The opening is way too big to accomplish that so, back it went to the supermarket.  I had hopes this OXO product could solve our bottle opening problem but since it doesn't, I am rating this only one star.	13
Used this for a week along with theDEWALT Fluorescent Area Lightfor lighting in the evenings at my cabin.  (I can charge batteries at a neighbor's.)  It performed well:  bright and easily carried with the battery attached.  Seems stable on the battery, doesn't knock over easily.  I didn't have much cause to use the pivoting head but I can imagine uses where that would be handy.  Battery life is decent, but for the price it would be nice if it was LED so you didn't have to worry about bulbs and the battery life would be longer.	21
Works well as diaper pail, but it's awesome as a bathroom garbage can.  No mess, no smell. Very easy to replace garbage bags, you do not have to touch anything.Got it as a gift, and was very skeptical about it at first. (It's only 100ft to the garbage  shoot outside the apartment).  That opinion changed quickly after the first night I had to wake up to change diapers.It holds about 2 days of diapers so never get a chance to stink things up.  Besides you baby will probably poop only 1-2 times /day.	3
As I remember vaudeville wasn't in style until the early 1900 and yet here is Jesus doing shtick.  I do believe that he could smile and see humor in some situations but the Sermon on the Mount was not one of them.  I could only make it through 9:9 and had to turn it off.  Just too much levity for my taste.Joy and happiness should be in the heart, mind and soul.  Not external as depicted in this movie.  I kept waiting for the custard pies to start flying.But, in all fairness, the movie was beautifully filmed.	15
LOVE these adaptors ! i got this one  mainly for my car... since it  has a  combo cd/cassette deck(which is awesome)this little  gem  does the trick...i use this to play  my mp3 players (sony and an ipod )  the audio quality is superb.. its  crystal clear..  i  also use this in the house on my stereo system...this is a great buy! and its worth it  to have a few of these on hand...you never know when youll need one.	10
I purchased this for my 2 year old niece who always wants to wear our watches.  It's a very cute watch, the lizards move across the face like a second hand.  The band is elastic, so once it's fitted for a small wrist you can just pull it off without re-sizing.  Another pro, Timex kids watches come with a ''warranty'' that if the child loses the watch within 12 months of the purchase date, you can buy another for $10.	8
I would highly recommend this classic to everyone from young teens to our most senior adults.  Warning it is a long, involved tale that can't be read in one evening.  Since every character is a man, it is a less than sentimental journey.  Though they are definitely some tearful scenes.  One character is a former slave, but is treated as the others' equal though somewhat condescendedly.  I enjoyed looking back at a culture and customs that are long gone.  And no spoilers, but you may want to read another Verne classic when done with this one...	14
just a word of advice to those of you who are considering BULK ORDERING this product...it does NOT store well...! if you order more than you can use in a few SHORT months, make sure that you have a DRY and preferably vacuum-sealed environment in which to store the unused portion.i bought a couple of lbs of powder and used it a couple of times...stored the extra lbs in a kitchen cabinet in their original packaging...months later, the UNOPENED bags of powder were as hard as rocks...!	11
The film is overwhelming with overkill.  It has everything.  Great stunts, great cinematography, epic (and acrobatic!) battle scenes, more blood than Quentin Tarantino could stomach, some sex, tea ceremonies, Chinese poetry, The Art of War, great acting, great overacting.  Director Woo was out to Wow and he succeeded.  Don't skip the credits.  The cast and crew of this film make the old DeMille &#34;cast of thousands&#34; look sadly understaffed.  If we started making films like this in the USA we could reduce the unemployment rate below 4 percent in no time at all.	0
I got the PC version of this game and its A far cry from the others in the NFS series. The graphics are horrid, the cars are weird not more normal cars like the ferraris or jaguars in the other need for speeds. The cars are hard to control, its way to easy to spin out and crash. The menu controls are hard to use to, for instance most of the options dont have A pull-down menu you have to cycle through all the options. If you want great racing get Need for Speed 3, High Stakes, or Porsche Unleashed.	23
I use this One Spot Adapter with the 5 pedal attachment. Works perfectly! I've seen reviews about this brand being noisy. I suspect this to be happening with the 8 pedal version. Too many for one simple 9 volt source to handle.I've owned it for a couple of months, used it at home 5 days a week and rehearsed at high volumes about a dozen times. Zero hum or buzz from the unit. I should also mention that I do not have any drive/distortion pedals on my board.	16
I was very impressed with the 12&quot; Delta benchtop drill press.  The 12&quot; handles everything I need it for and also has an impressive number of accessory toys available to upgrade it (mortising attachement, etc.).  It weighs a ton so I would highly recommend finding a place for it and mounting it there--it's not a lot of fun to try and move around.  As for the lamp accessory--it's worthless.  That's why I rated it a 4 versus a 5.  It attaches with a magnet...and then it slides down and falls off.  Overall, I would recommend this product without reservation.  Just supply your own light.	21
We have been using Duracell for many years, and have always trusted our camping and emergency needs and devices we use to being powered by them, in one form or another.  Sure there are cheaper batteries out there, rechargeable even and solar too; and of course Duracell has their versions of all of these.We do believe in being green, and doing the best to keep our energy footprint small, and we have found over the years we can count on the Copper top for most of our needs.  And of course we should all dispose of them properly.	12
Bought this to replace a similar one I'd had for many many years.  I really liked the old one, but had repaired the handle many times & it was now beyond repair.  Wish I'd bought this one sooner!  The soft grip is wonderful, & the ridges on the working surface make it glide thru the cheese much easier; no more bogging down, no more  bunched up cheese slices.  Just a nice, wafer thin piece of cheese that does not stick to the plane when you try to take it off.	13
I bought the pink 7ft cable and really like it.  I took it to a workshop where no wireless signals were permitted (radio telescope workshop.. obvious reasons for that necessity), and everyone had ethernet cables and it was just a mess with all the cables and trying to figure out which went with which laptop, etc.  But, thanks to this distinctive cable, I didn't have to be concerned with any of those issues--or with my cable magically disappearing! (which seemed to be the fate for a few of the many, many mundane blue ones).	10
This is the scent I've been looking for!  It does not even come close to the boyish commercial perfumes they call mens aftershave today. Now many on here claim this stuff burn like lava. Nonsense! Absolutely false. The first time I splashed this on my face the thought that came to mind was I possibly just stuck my face into a hornets nest! Or maybe I had touched a live electrical wire to my face!  It leaves the skin tight and firm and the smell is not overpowering. The wife loves it too! I'll be using this forever.	12
I've used these brush heads for several months now and they do a great job (while still leaving some enamel on my teeth).  Amazon shipped them promptly & there were no problems.  I've read some unhappy reviews on brush heads that apparently seem to be the same thing, but turn out not to be quite the same.  So just be sure that, out of the plethora of brush heads, you choose the genuine Oral-B brand and that they're shipped & sold by Amazon.	12
After decades of woodworking projects, I finally bought these and am very happy with how well the design works. While not fast and require two hands, they hold your work incredibly well.A nice little trick to quickly open or close in fast amounts before clamping on work, spin the entire clamp holding a handle in each hand as if you're pedaling a bike by hand. That opens or closes quickly depending on direction. Then fine tune once clamping down on work pieces.Will purchase more in the future as my needs increase.	21
"First of all, the movie is great.  I consider Bon Scott to be the best rock frontman that ever lived.  So if you are getting this for the movie, you will not be disappointed.  The extras, on the other hand, are very weak.  All the extra ""footage"" is other peoplt talking about AC/DC.  I expected more real video of Bon and the band.  I would have gladly paid $20 for just the movie instead of having to buy this ""collectors"" edition."	6
"I am a huge fan of Bobby Darin but this video is just terrible. Instead of hearing Darin songs I want to hear I'm forced to hear songs like ""Bridge Over Troubled Water"" and ""Midnight Special"" might I add these songs are performed terribly. He sings Mack the knife And Beyond The Sea but he sings them boringly (is that even a word) and lame. no enthusiasm at all. I wish they would give out a tape of him in his earlier years so it would be more entertaining."	6
It's not fancy, but it's well though out, and you can't beat the value. The edges don't cut your neck, and having adjustments at both ends allows you to adjust it exactly how you want. Like others, I had to unstitch the pick holder pocket in order to provide a greater range of adjustment. The foam position is never a problem as it will slide where you want, and it flexible/thin enough to go through the buckles if needed. Excellent no frills product with good enough cushioning for a bass.	16
Make note that this product is for laser printers!  Great product for office or at home use.  If you have a mass mailing to do, you will find Avery templates and labels extremely useful.  These products come with Easy Peel technology to make sticking the labels on envelopes even easier.  Anytime you have to print labels, look to these Avery labels.  A good value for your money.  You can address 750 envelopes with just one package.  Do you know how much time mail merge, a printer, and some avery labels will save you.  You won't be disappointed!	17
I was not expecting it, but this bar has what seems to be a watered-down yogurt coating.The bar tastes fairly decent, but I wouldn't exactly call it oatmeal raisin.  It has a distinct raw cookie dough flavoring to it.  There doesn't seem to be much oatmeal taste.There are plenty of other bars out there with less fat (and FAR less saturated fat) that actually taste better.  This is a quality bar, no doubt, as are all Kashi products, but I would not care to use it as a meal replacement on a daily basis.	11
commenting on coffee-mate is not at issue here.  it does not clump, dissolves instantly and makes your cafe taste good. what i like about and and buy for is the size.  we are a coffee family and this 56oz size last a month.  it is not used for hot cocoa or tea so i can't comment on that.  all up all size containers to eqal 56ozs and it comes to a heck of a lot of money at the supermarket.  this canister is the right size and price for me.  will keep coming back.	11
They are not made in the USA anymore, but this is still the best all-around drill that money can buy. They have not changed them much in all the years they have been making them. This not your typical throw-away Black&Decker or Craftsman drill. I love the Quik-Lok cord feature; it is very handy and helps extend the life of the cord. I have five 5.5amp Magnums (USA Made) and they never quit on me. They should last me the rest of my life; all they need is the brushes replaced every now and then.	21
Easily the best RPG I have ever played. Graphics are not the best, but the battle system, immersive storyline, great music, detailed cities, and unique characterizations are phenomenal. Unlike many future RPG's, the load times for Suikoden 2 are very short, most likely due to the substandard graphics. If you can get over the graphics, the rest of the gameplay is incredible. The plot is unforgettable, and collecting the 108 stars of destiny is challenging and fun. Many side-quests, secrets, and player choices make this RPG one of my favorites to this day. Suikoden 2 is a classic.	23
"This does a great job trimming the bikini area.  It's a nice size - slim and light, feels good in the hand, not too loud.  I was worried I wouldn't be able to trim as short as I want.  With the attachment on, you can get down to 1/8"" (their measurement).  But if you want to go shorter, just take the attachment off.  I'm careful using it without the attachment because I don't want to nick myself - I use it gently and don't press.  But I haven't nicked myself yet."	12
These headphones are ok, but they look cheap, since they are, and I didn't notice much difference in the sound quality from my sparkplug's to these. I couldnt wear these for more than an hour without them hurting my ears, but for the price you could certainly do worse. Honestly though, if your willing to go to in ear headphones, go with the spark plugs, the are better at noise isolating, fit better in your ears, and I really cant notice a diffrence in sound quality + they're like half the price.	10
My oldest had to have Mr Potato Head when Toy Story came out. Of course the cardboard box didn't last long & the pieces were scattered & lost but with this set the container is plastic & it is easier to keep the pieces together & hold their attention longer. It is now being played with by child # 3, so I would say it is definitely worth the money. My only complaint would be the container could be a little bigger to allow little hands to put the accessories away easier. But all in all, it is a great toy.	22
I was bored and trolling Amazon and saw this...it looked like fun so I ordered it. I read the assembly directions, which said you need 3 people, but a woman said in her review that she assembled her trampoline alone...props to her cause I tried and nothing...absolutely no movement whatsoever. I took it to work and 3 guys assembled it very easily, but used their combined strength to make the pieces go together and open. The smell is obnoxious, which I hope will dissipate over time. All in all a fun purchase.	20
These patches will greatly extend the life of you bass drum heads. Even if you use felt beaters on your kick pedal these pads greatly increase the strength and toughness of your bass drum head in the exact place it is needed most. As far as I can tel these do not change the sound of your head much if at all. They stay exactly where you put them so be sure to get it right the first time.If you have a double bass kick pedal I highly recommend either this patch or one from another name brand company.	16
I've had this cd since the day it was released. I've listened to it everyday since and it never gets old. The songs are solid, the playing is probably their best on record, it's an amazing cd. I could write a review of every song, but it's already been done. If you like old Rush, the 3 piece guitar band with the big sound, you'll love this cd. If you ever wondered how Rush would sound if they improvised rather than rehearsed every note to metronome perfection, you'll love this cd.	6
Love this!  Does what everyone says.  Puts a polish and shine that lasts 3-6 months.  Makes new cars staybright and old oxidized cars 'almost' look new.  What's great is just rub on and buff off in 15 min., and you use only a capful per 3 sq/ft.  Water beads up and rolls off, or gets blown off while driving(water flies off the windshield). Between waxing, add a capful to bucket of clean water and wash your car. MUST dry car immediately with microfiber cloths so no spots will form.  HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!  Great shipping by AMAZON and VENDOR.	2
"I couldn't put this book down. I love murder mysteries, and this was a good one. Every time I had time to read, I was thinking ""Oh, good, I get to read some more of this book!"" I'll be reading more books by John Luciew.One thing I do need to mention is that this book needed some more editing. Some of the paragraphs were indented and some weren't, and there were several typos. But there wasn't enough of a problem to pull me out of the story. The book was just too good to let the errors bother me."	14
I feel that the producers had a heavy hand in this season.The colony definitely was not as well organized or focused as the previous season.  The location this season was also a LOT less defensible than the first, but it seemed that they never tried.  I am also thinking that there was a LOT of area that they never looked into, and their hunting and gathering was almost non-existent.If the first season was an example of a healthy and striving colony, then this is an example of an unhealthy colony.	0
If you have a Samsung Galaxy Note 2, S3 or S4, this is a phenomenal case.  It has the metal belt clip that slips on and off along with a belt loop that fits most running belts.  The case also has a neck strap loop!I run distances of 10 miles or more and stream my music via bluetooth to my sunglasses.  This case does not hinder the signal.The case is easy to open and close.  This case is better than the $30 case I used before.  My running belt is an Amphipod.	7
This One Beyond Salmon & Whole Brown Rice dry kibble is the only healthy dry food my 9 year old cat will eat. In fact, he loves it so much he eats it every night and never gets tired of it. He's is missing several teeth but has no problem chewing this small sized kibble. Real salmon is the first listed ingredient and there are cranberries, tomatoes and spinach along with whole brown rice. No corn or wheat. This product is not easy to find so I am particularly happy to purchase it through the subscribe and save program.	19
"Well, here's what i have to say, this strap is much shorter than im used to, but seeing how I bought this for an off guitar, that's ok. They really should put the length in the description, the length is 53"" max, where I like my straps to be 64"" max.It is a hard strap to get on the guitar, (I do not suggest getting this strap withDunlop Dual Design Straplok System, Nickel), these are great locks, BUT almost impossible to install on this strap.Overall great buy for a cheap little money saver."	16
It all depends on whether your dog likes it or not. My friend's dog chews up toys within a day or two of getting them. He has this one still after several months. The head is gone, but the rest is intact. My boyfriend's dog, however, only picks it up when she knows I'm waiting for her to play with it. My only complaint is that when your dog is carrying it around, if he scrapes up against you with the little nubs can be pretty sharp.	19
This is the world's all time leading cheater.  I have been playing backgammon for over 60yrs,  more than 1,000,000 games at least.  Statistics show that if you leave a spire open this app will hit you 90 / percent of the time. If you play this game as much as I do you know the statistical average is around  35 percent.  And wait until you get to a roll off,  count on the machine getting 3-4 doubles. They even have a disclaimer telling you why they are not cheating. This game is no fun.Grampyz	1
"I purchased this for my pedalboard a few years ago, and have always loved it. I only use 3-4 pedals, and this is always one of them. It sounds great, is indestructable, and takes up almost no space. The controls are great, and you can get a large variety of sounds. I have played ""boutique"" chorus pedals, and the Boss is loads better in every way. You will not regret this purchase.Pros:-easy to use-no hum-small-sonds awesome-indestructabecons:-NONEIf you want an awesome chorus that has been around forever, will last forever, and sounds incredible, get this."	16
Aerobie rings are awesome as for distance, though you have to have good control.  Otherwise, you may find it leaves your neighborhood.It's good for kids when learning, because it will still fly if they flub the toss.They don't hold up to UV and weather really well.  A year in the backyard and the plastic is faded and brittle.  YMMV, but it should last a long time if you bring it in when you're done with it.Be advised that while the image shows a three-pack, you get only one.  They're a little pricey, but not too bad if you're expecting it.	20
I have been using this saw to cut maple ply for cabinets (not cheap stuff to make bad cuts on)and it performs great. I was using an old skill saw and it always seemed to wander and I figured it must be the operator. Most of my mistakes came at the start of the cut but the guide and the excellent visibility of your cut enables even untrained operators like myself perform well. In response to earlier reviews about the depth locking nut coming loose... I have not found this problem. You will be happy with this purchase.	21
Love these strings. I use them exclusively on my Gibson LP Studio Deluxe because it seems to corrode ordinary strings quickly. I have a washburn with a glossy, sealed looking fretboard, that doesn't have that problem, but still prefer these strings for it as well. They tend to be a little stiffer than ernie ball's, but I like the way they sound and they feel great when bending and sliding. I can keep these on my guitar for weeks of daily playing without the corrosion and deadness that I get with other brands.	16
I've used pressure cookers for many years including some of those very expensive models.  This is one of the best cookers I've ever owed.  This cooker is constructed of high quality stainless steel and is very easy to use.  Pressure cookers are very safe. If you follow a few simple rules, you'll never have a problem.  I use my cooker weekly for everything from cream of potato soup to braised lamb shanks with wine sauce.  Additionally, it is amazingly cheap to own. My only con: wish it was made in the USA, otherwise, highly recommend.	13
I am absolutely Stunned by This Movie directed by John Woo...This film is a beautiful film which I have to say deservers *5* Stars!!!It is a beautiful retelling of the Red Cliff Wars in 208 AD in China.  All of the actors werereally Great.  I wish I had the whole version of this movie, but alas,I only have the American Version that only runs for 148 minutes.  I hear thismovie is actually 4.5 hours long.  But I like the American Version just as well (because you can hear it in English)	0
I love these pens.  I am a college student and have been a big fan of Pilot G3, but they are so expensive.  I bought these because they were affordable and I love them.  I can get 12 pens for about a buck, and they will last me at least to college semesters (16 weeks).  That really saves me money compared to the G3 that would only last about 6 weeks.Don't get me wrong, the G3 is a great pen, it is just too expensive.	17
I bought these jeans because I just got tired of the high price of Levis.  These things are so good, that I just donated my used Levis.  These fit nice. look good and seem substantial.  Since my first two pairs, I bought two more, and will soon order another two pairs.  Got to have plenty on hand.  I recommend them if you're a blue jean wearer, and want a better fit, that doesn't seem to shrink as much as some of the competition.	8
I posted a review of this camera a few weeks ago, shortly after purchasing it.  I gave it 4 stars, mainly because the manual wasn't well written.  However, that still being the case, I must say that this camera deserves 5 stars!  It takes amazingly clear, bright pictures.  The video display LCD  is bright.  And it seemed to take forever for the rechargable batteries to  run down! I highly recommend this camera!  If it had an optical zoom, it  would be perfect.  However, with this camera, you get more than you pay for!	10
I've been using My Fitness Pal for a week to track my calorie intake, and it's definitely become &#34;my pal&#34;!  It's helping me monitor what I eat and be accountable to myself.  It can be a little time consuming to get started, looking everything up, but it gets easier.  The option to save a meal is great for me, because I tend to repeat my breakfasts and lunches.  I haven't used the exercise logging yet...that's the next thing to learn!	1
This jigsaw cuts extremely well.  I dont know how Bosch does it but there is something about this jig saw that makes it cut better than all the others.  Throw in the quick change option and WHOA! it's unbelievable.  Unless you use your jigsaw on rare occasions, or really just need a jigsaw  for cutting rough stuff, get this one.PROS** Easy blade change**  Unbelievable cutting performance** Great baseCONS** NONE (that i  can think of)	21
I have three large mixed breed dogs who are extremely powerful chewers and after much trial and error, I would never buy any other brand except Nylabone.  Nothing else lasts as long and occupies them as Nylabone does.  They always fight over this one in particular - perhaps they like it because it is much larger than all their other Nylabones.  This is definitely the largest one I have seen, so I would only recommend this for someone with a large dog.  I would recommend anything Nylabone if you want your dogs to chew a toy instead of your furniture!	19
This mouse has served me well for the past 10 years, and I hope it lasts another 10!  It's ergonomic, it doesn't need to be cleaned very often, it's very precise (far more precise than the thumb-balls Logitech currently sells), it has four buttons assignable to just about any function... superior in every way.Recently I tried to buy another one for work but couldn't find anything like it.  If you can find one, buy it!  ...and make sure to register it so Logitech realizes it's still popular!	10
People know Mystikal can rap,and that's something that makes LET'S GET READY and TARANTULA tight,but people forget before he was &quot;bouncin' back&quot; and makin' chicks &quot;shake it fast&quot;,Mystikal was tellin' people they &quot;ain't ready yet&quot;.MIND OF MYSTIKAL made people notice he wasn't a come-n-go rapper,which he prove a lot through this c.d.Every track is tight(in some cases lyrically and comically).If you heard this c.d,you know it's tight.If not,then you missin' out.	9
I had purchased the Petmate Deluxe model of the 50-ounce Pet Fountain for my cats. That works exactly as described and my cats drink more than they did from bowls of water around the house. I like blue, and the basic model seemed as if it would perform the same as the deluxe model. My cats still drink from this model, but it doesn't fit together as well as the deluxe model and, as a result, it often leaks, leaving puddles around it. If I purchase another, I will only get the Deluxe model.	19
There are lots of positivie reviews about this toy, which you can refer to hear all the good things this toy has to offer. Here are the I don't like about it:1. It's makes noise that is appealing to children but very annoying to the adults in our family.2. There is no place within the toy to store all the gears and pieces that come with it, so they end up easily separated and strewn around and lost easily.UPDATE: This toy lasted two and a half months before the motor that turns the gears broke and the toy stopped working for good.	22
This is my favorite Clancy book - and edging out the Hunt for Red October isn't easy.  This is a thick book, yet you will get through it quickly because it is so interesting.  It has the most character development of any book.  Rainbox 6 follows this, so you should read Without Remorse before Rainbow 6.  Note, there are fairly descriptive scenes - torturing a man with a pressure tank, young women forced into rough sex (pliers on parts of the body, etc.).  But without villians you can't have a hero.	5
"Such a cool app! While I was driving on the highway it said ""driving"". So many interesting words and full of ghosts outside, but not in our house pitifully.I will have to drag my tablet outside and have some fun listening to the words :DEdit: Ok, I have to edit my review. The app did detect a ghost inside. It said: Johnatan, sick, rest, care, lake, (At that time I stood up and moved away) Next words were move, come, hide and so on. At the same time, I heard two loud bangs in the bathtub.....spooky"	1
This game is totally awesome. Very advanced, wide variety of items, enemies, and places. Excellent graphics, even for Gameboy. A very challenging adventure is in this cartridge, and its tons of fun! Play it on a Gameboy Color and you can go to a secret dungeon! Its like a normal labryinth, and instead of getting an instrument, you get red clothes which doubles your offense permanently, or blue clothes, which doubles your defense permanently (my personal choice). Superb game! Excellent adventure.	23
This was always a full 5 star for me (I use it on my Asus/Google Nexus 7).  With the last update, suddenly you can no longer long tap on a song or artist and &#34;Add to Now Playing&#34;.  Very annoying drop, and no real reason to lose it.  Please bring this back, Amazon.  Knocked off a point for losing this feature.  Not super thrilled with the new interface either, but change is change as far as aesthetics.  Bring back Add to Now Playing (like Add to Queue from Google Play Music).	1
I wear a size 34 waist and based on the manufacturer's recommendations I ordered a size medium. They fit a little on the tight side around the waist, but I don't expect to be gaining any weight (hopefully). The manufacture of the pants looks to be very nice and I have not doubt they will serve their purpose very well. Although I have no complains with these pants, the next size I purchase will be a large - I prefer them to be a little loose as appose to a little tight.	8
"I have OXO 12"" tongs and love them in the kitchen, so I ordered these 16"" ones for the outdoor grill. These 16"" tongs have a weak spring so that when you release them, they do not spring open like the 12"" ones do. You have to kind of use your fingers to pry them back to the open position, making them very annoying. I already threw away the packaging assuming I would like them otherwise I would definitely return. Buy 12"" instead and you will be happy."	13
I'm very satisfied with this affordable blow up tub.  The bottom part under the baby's butt blows up separately than the sides, which is nice because my 6 month old was unstable sitting on the blown up bottom at first.  She loves the ability to play in the water in here, I just have a hard time keeping her sitting in the tub, she keeps wanting to stand up and climb the bathtub walls. I think that's more an issue with my very active daughter than the tub though :)	3
I received a lovely pendant necklace several years ago, and wear it everywhere, but my long hair always tangles in the chain and trying to get the hair out usually breaks the chain.  I average buying about 4 new chains a year.  Since purchasing this chain, my hair is not tangled nor ripped out by the links, clothing fiber doesn't catch on it, my pendant does not get stuck on the clasp-in short, this is the worlds most perfect chain!  I cannot tell you how happy I am with this purchase!	8
This is an incredible and accurate portrayal of Washington's Crossing the Delaware, and his remarkable defeatof one of the World's best armies - the Mercenary Hessians - in the 18th Century - from which the Britishnever recovered, and made the first reversal which resulted in victory! Most important, how General Washingtonliterally got off of his high horse, dared to sit as an equal in a row boat with some of his most common soldiers,and led them to victory!  America needs more &#34;boots-on-the-ground&#34; leadership like this today!	15
I have a SIGG water bottle that needed cleaning. My first search resulted in a special SIGG brush that was ~$9. This was ~$4. In combination with Efferdent tablets, this brush works great to clean and refresh the bottle and remove the metallic-y smell from my bottle. (DONT BUY THE SIGG TABLETS -- SIGG Tablets are 24 tablets for ~$8 while Efferdent, which works EXACTLY the same, is 120 tablets for ~$6!!!). Be smart people; Don't buy the SIGG branded stuff since this brush (and the Efferdent tablets) work just the same, if not better for a lot less money.	12
"Although the ""genuine leather handle"" of this E16S hammer is more like a slick hard lacquered wood, its quality is unsurpassed. Oddly, this model is about 3/4 of an inch shorter than theEstwing E3-16S 16-Ounce Rip Hammerwhich has a nylon handle. Between the two, I prefer the nylon handle, but having a steel tip on the handle's base is helpful for positioning and nudging pieces into place. As others have noted, this is a classic for good reason: time-tested design and simply a beautiful tool to own."	21
"Vic is back, baby! I'm certainly an unapologetic fan of this show primarily because it's a study of a well-written, character-driven offering.Avail yourself (if haven't already) to this bubbling cauldron of people being people - while not always pretty or flattering - that is fairly ""real."" Sure, I like Law & Order but it's a little too tidy and ""TV"" for me sometimes while The Shield is right on the cusp of non-premium Cable edginess. Any Shield fan or crime drama junky will not be disappointed."	0
Comparing multi-blade razors, Mach III is best: By far the easiest to clean, best balanced, and the most securely attached handle-to-head. These things -matter-, the shaves are otherwise fairly equal.  IF YOU MUST: I used double-edge 'safety' razors for years, before there -were- cartridges. If you have a tough hide, or are master barber, fine, but regular guys continue get cut on a regular basis with the old style. Mach III will shave you just as close, you will never get cut.	12
"These are the ticket if you're interested working efficiently.  They set up in seconds (not minutes, and not half the morning like I see some ""carpenters"" doing on job sites when they build them).  They are rock solid.  They are portable - fold 'em up and take them to the next job.  And, most importantly to me, they make it a breeze to set up a good workstation.  I'd give them 5 stars if they came with some sort of rubber footpads to prevent scratching finished floors."	21
Unlike most other apps that only want a few hundred dollars to keep the game up-to-date, this app is like staring down into the main intake of the money shredder of the US Mint.  Very habit forming, much worse than heavy drugs, it's SO easy to tap away all your money, creating a deluge of really nice Amazon &#34;stuff&#34; you don't really need as much as food or toilet paper./SARCASM OFF/Darn, look!  There's that new Android game for my tablet.....no, No, NO!  Haalllp!	1
This show is amazing. So many talented performers putting a great musical-comedy every week. Seems impossible to do. These actors and writers are the best in TV. I'm not into much current television, but this show surely brightens my evening. Everyone should give it a chance. You think this shows not for you? You're probably wrong. Haven't loved a program so much since Buffy went off the air. Instant classic. Up there with Buffy, Twin Peaks and a couple of other landmarks. Give it a shot.	0
I tried this book because I wanted something light and happy for this Christmas season.  I was very surprised to find it concerned an older hotel in San Francisco, one of my most favorite cities.  The heroine was a strong woman and she meets a man who is instantly attracted to her.  She is a little klutzy but all sorts of fun.  Personally, I can relate to that. I read this book I one short evening and think you'd enjoy this romance too.  If nothing else, it is a little different from the usual Contemporary Romance.  Happy Reading!	14
This is an excellent value. You can charge your iPod/iPhone from a 12 volt lighter plug or with the ac to usb charger. A handy retractable usb cord is included in the kit. Works very well with my iPod Touch. The 12 volt charger keeps my iPod's charge topped up and let's me listen to an entire audiobook without losing power just as the story gets interesting. Both chargers also work well with other devices that charge through the usb port. I charge my bluetooth headset and my extra battery packs with these chargers.	7
I was originally going to get one of the small squares to go behind my newly installed speakers but after comparing the price per square foot, I decided to tackle a box of this stuff. A box let me cover four doors and my roof in my subaru wrx wagon.This car is my first non Mercedes in 15 years and although the subaru is still an econo box, this made the stereo sound way better, reduced road noise and give the car a more &#34; luxury&#34; feel. Well worth the price and effort to install.	2
The material seems durable, but it does not fit tightly on my 30x9.5x15.  There is almost no elastic properties for the interior, and it would easily spin on the tire itself, and stealing it would be ridiculously easy.  The bottom looked like granny panties on a supermodel.  Couldn't see that delightful bottom curve.I used a grommett kit on it so I can thread a rope around it to cinch it tightly.  Has faded to a charcoal gray from black since purchase 18+ months ago.	2
It's not that we're soft, like &#34;marshmallows.&#34; It's more like we're addicts for the soft, sweet, heated up, treats that The Veronica Mars show dished out. We're more like raccoons. We can't get enough of that browned, white, semi burned, funky stuff. The movie delivered it. Dished it right up on a reminiscent platter on a brand new table. Yum! Feels as good as ever. And if we gotta dish out more Kick Starter Cash to get Movie Two&#8230; DON'T BE SURPRISED. We raccoons have a tendency to get what we crave, one way or the other. You Dig?	0
Water for Elephants was a fantastic book.  Easy to read and interesting.  Most impressively, a topic that I never gave much thought to, Depression-Era travelling train circuses, was something I enjoyed reading about.  To be honest, I never knew there was such a topic.  Now I'm wondering if there are any Industrial Revolution cat juggling books out there that I should be reading.  Anyway, Gruen seemed to do a decent amount or research for the book, so I learned a little something about the topic.  The best part of the book was the fantastic ending.  More books should end like that.	5
I almost always order Bali bras because they are true to size.  I ordered 44DDD and it fits me perfectly and is very comfortable for maybe half a day.  After about 5 hours the underwire started to poke under my arms.  I much prefer not to wear any bra with an underwire because they are notoriously uncomfortable, but apparently there are none in my size.  The covering on the underwire is quite soft and cushiony but still the wires poke through into my under arms.  I am disappointed but maybe I am ordering the wrong size.	8
I'd give this 10 stars if possible. I like a #2 pencil. Of ALL the mechanical pencils I have used in the last 20 years, I finally realized that no other pencil even comes near as good. THE ERASERS ARE EXCELLENT. Other mechanical pencil leads are more prone to break. ALSO THESE ERASERS DO NOT SMUDGE YOUR PAPER like others do.These have a very long life. Occasionally I find one in the house that several years old, and find that the eraser is still soft and smudgless.	17
i have thick frizzy red hair, this bottle of jojoba oil has replaced every high end pricy hair product i have ever owned!! (and i've tried them all..) i use it in my hair while still wet & let air dry.  my hair is super silky soft.  cant beat it.  also, in my 3rd trimester of pregnacy i use it on my belly as an anti itch oil.  works great.  definatly reccommend if you have dry skin or hair.  you will find no better oil than this especially at this price :)	4
Several years ago my dermatologist recommended Zeasorb and I have been using it ever since.  It has become more a necessity now due to my weight gain following radiation and chemo treatment for late-stage cancer.  The powder is helpful in keeping the moist areas of my skin as dry as possible and free from itch.  The 2.5 oz. size being sold now is probably as a result of TSA's size requirements.  I was used to buying the 11.5 oz. size in the past.  The 2.5 oz. size is more convenient for travel.	12
Great cinematography! Good Acting! Fun story! AND John Saxon! Weeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee! Very good place to start looking at Argento's films, it still has some of his artsy style, but it's not a mish-mash of terrifying images like suspiria (which is considered his masterpiece and I must agree, but this one is just as good for different reasons), it's a very coherent story, nice and violent :) I love it when the girl paints the wall, (you'll see..) The soundtrack rocks, and the deaths are very well orchestrated.Good Times, Good Times.....	15
This scratch remover seems to be more of a polish  and lube that will remove the surface scratches for the paint. It does not appear to have any &#34;grinding&#34; type ingredients in the paste.It will have little of no impact on deep scratches or deep nicks in the paint. It is easy to out on and remove and will a decent job for those light scratches. It did not remove any discoloring on my paint such as a stain left by a bird dropping. It ddi make the blemish lighter though.	2
I had this in my wishlist & received it for Christmas.  I've used it several times & I love it.  Its smaller than the one I had previously but that is perfect for us.  Only 3 at home anymore.I love that this is made of stainless steel.  The insert is still made of aluminum which Im not thrilled about but I dont have to use it if I dont want to.This pressure cooker is also a lot quieter than my old one is.  I appreciate that a LOT!Its a great product and Im so happy to have it.	13
I really loved this version.  I had watched the film on cable,  but it never filled the HD screen.  I have no idea, but I decided to purchase the 40th Anniversary which is also the Director's Cut.  The film deserved it's Oscar.  It is a Time Capsule of a time and a place that has never been reproduced (but they did try).The ratio is not full HD, but the screen is much larger, performers get longer sets, more music.  For anyone curious or to see what this was all about, you cannot go wrong with this set.	6
I have to agree with reviewers, the nipple of the Avent bottles is great. It's obvious watching my baby that he latches on similar to the way he does on the breast.The problem is that the bottles leak like crazy. My little guy ends up wearing as much milk as he drinks. I've tried all of the suggestions, but have had no success in making the bottle leak proof. I've had to go out and buy different bottles with nipples I don't like as much just so that I don't have the mess.	3
I ordered this product thinking it would be great if I could pump directly into the bottles we'd be feeding our baby with, eliminates a step right?  Well, having the extra bottles for pumping has been great and the work well in the freezer but they don't work well for feeding.  Milk seems to pour out our newborns mouth (3 mos now).  I hate pumping and really hate seeing my milk being wastes so we have stopped using the bottles to feed and only for storage.  I like the evenflow glass bottles better, she wastes very little milk with those	3
"Outstanding. The ""Rockumentary"" shows the footage from Led Zeppelin's concert in New York city as well as a bit from their personal lives.The viewer gets an idea of what it's like from their end of the tour as well as some of the most outstanding music ever in concert.Most noteworthy is the drum solo from ""Moby Dick"" from the late John Bonham.It is long,but anything but boring.Overall,this is evidence of why their will never again be quite a decade like the 1970s for music."	6
First, let me say that I enjoyed this book and the angle that the author took. However, due to the way that it is written, I did not develop any kind of attachment to any of the main characters. This book is basically written as a narrative of events that happened, reminding me of a fictional history book. The book also gets very technical about its development of the space drive and weapons.  Liked it, didn't love it. Will buy the next one to see what happens.	14
I had to replace my Buxton organizer clutch that I have had for years and years and years. Poor thing was definitely looking dog-eared. I was delighted when I received the new one, and found it was exactly like my old one. No cheapening of the product at all.This is not the fanciest purse organizer that you can buy, nor the most expensive.  But if you want something that just gets the job done, than this is it.  I expect that this will last for years also.Definitely recommended.	8
"Water for Elephants is loaded with interesting words because Sara Gruen owns a commanding vocabulary, and utilizes her well-chosen words with precision.  She also understands how to set the hook and carefully reel her reader in.  She's a master angler.The story is entertaining and the setting--a train circus-- is interesting.  Obviously Gruen heavy research is what birthed the rich detail.While some call this a romance book, the romance is lacking and rushed.  This is more of an action-adventure ""who done it."""	5
The Performance is HISTORIC and LEGENDARY, but... where's the DVD? I have this entire show on CD and it's one of my most widely listened to records. The Performance / Artistry goes without saying. This (Other than Live At Woodstock - which i'm still waiting for the complete Hendrix Woodstock perormance on DVD, not the crappy edited version which leaves out half the songs - other than Woodstock this is Hendrix at his film/recorded BEST. I'm gonna buy this tape right now cause' i've been wating for the DVD for 4 years and it still aint' been released.	6
Like every Avery paper product I've ever used in the last 25 years (a whole lot), they are superior in terms of fit, function and finish.  The thought of an Avery label jamming up my printer is non-existent.  While it's always possible to get cheaper labels, let's just say you'll get what you pay for with Avery.  Not to mention you can really save a bundle by purchasing them on Amazon, as compared to any in-person stationary type store.	17
"If you like tons of tiny pieces to clean up... And tons of choking hazards this is the game for you.Pros:Idea is neat, balancing beans until the bowl tips over.Cons:Around 60 tiny plastic beans to clean up.Surface of the bowl has very little traction so beans slide and tip off very quickly.The game is too hard for children under 8, and not interesting for children over 8.Suggestion:Buy ""Don't Break the Ice"" instead... Kids love it and it is made by the same company and runs the same price."	22
I got this for my beagle pup as she cannot stop chewing.  I've purchased nearly every chew toy Amazon sells and finally got this.  It was too hard for my 11 week old puppy.  She check it out, mouthed it and never touched it again.  Maybe when she gets larger....Meanwhile, my 8 year-old son loves dinosaurs and wanted it.  So, now it's his.  He knows he might be able to give it up one day, but I don't think I will be able to get it back.	19
When you are counting calories, this app is really helpful. You can build in your own foods to make recording faster. I like that it tracks everything from calories, to fat, to protein to even the basic vitamins. Useful to make sure you are also eating a well rounded diet. Only complaint is that it sometimes has issues erroring out &#34;synchronizing&#34; and can only be used if you have network connection. I don't always get good service at work so then I can't record. Would love an offline mode that can then be synched later.	1
The main plot of the story wasn't too bad. The part that was confusing was the age of the character.  Although the main characters were over the age of 60 a lot of times I found them acting like people my age (37) or younger.  Also, I am somewhat tech-savy, but was a little put off by references to outdated gadgets.  I actually had to Google what a Palm Treo was.  This book is probably best for people over 60.  I also found it to be a very hard hard.  It seemed to take me forever to get through it.	14
It was what it was.  With approximately a billion jokes tailored &#34;for the fans,&#34; it's an easy pass if you aren't already a fan of the series.  There isn't much of a story here, and it about equals the quality of the show it's based on.  That said, if you're a fan, you'll probably enjoy it and laugh harder than everyone else in the room.  It'll make you intolerable to everyone else, but you'll feel special.	0
This was an excellent, fast paced story that I didn't want to put down.There is a small issue with formatting that I almost deducted a star for, but I just couldn't do it as it did not hinder my reading much at all. It's only a matter of sentences dropping to a new line in the middle and not having page breaks between chapters.  Annoying, but not debilitating.The characters here are vivid and believable. The writing is succinct and graphic.This was a steal for $.99. I will definitely be watching out for more from this author.	14
a detailed drawing of a huge heart of stone, Cher sitting next to it(with big hair)and from a distance...it all looked like a skull! Some used-CD's stores may have one festering in their bargain bins(I found it on cassette). The music doesn't reflect that original cover(may be why they changed it): it's power pop, heavy on lovelorn ballads. Very entertaining, but not exactly varied, colorful or substantial. Probably the best Cher from this period however, as &quot;Cher&quot;(with &quot;I Found Someone&quot;)and &quot;Love Hurts&quot; were slim on the hits. B+	9
I very much enjoyed. It was sensual, and romantic.. Cal and Laurel were wonderfly done. I cheered for her through the entire story. A bit of mystery and a lost sole finding home.

Bought the pink one for dd so she could have a scooter like her brothers.She gets around on that thing too fast i think lol.What can i say it is a Razor they are the best. We have a few other brands and they are not as easy to close up and store as the Razors are.Great scooter and super way for them to get good exercise and just enjoy being a kid! Too bad i never had one growing up oh wait that is ok because honestly i use theirs sometimes lol!	20
This is a well-made and well-acted musical version of the Tom Sawyer story. It does not follow the book exactly, but the substance is there. Charming performances by then child actors Johnny Whitaker (Tom) and Jodie Foster (Becky Thatcher) and Academy-Award-winner Celeste Holm as Aunt Polly. I thoroughly enjoyed this movie. I rented it for my granddaughter's school project and wound up watching it 3 times. It took me back to my childhood of playing with the children next door in a more neighborly world.Highly recommended.	10
"This was worth the price,earpiece volume is great, no problem hearing incoming voice.  The only problem is that the mic is so far away from my mouth (as a result of such a compact product), that in order to have good voice transmission, I must hold my hand up and ""cup"" it from the corner of my mouth to the earpiece so my voice can be heard clearly.  This product would be perfect if it the mic portion extended a couple inches further towards the mouth."	7
This product not only works well, but it's also fun to watch!!, especially when rabbits, cats, or dogs come to do their business in your loan or rabbits eating your grass, this thing blast them with a burst of water before they can escape!! I love watching this in the early moring hours. Also when a dog or cat wants to take a poop in your yard and the owner of the pet just lets them do it with cleaning up behind them, this thing will blast the animal with water and they will run away from you property. Have fun watching!!	18
This is an absolutely wonderful game.  I own about 300 games, and would easily put this up in the top ten of them.  It's great for kids and adults, it's easy to learn and explain, it looks great, it doesn't take too long, it's a great combination of luck and strategy, it plays great with 2 through 5 people .... I could go on and on.  But why take up your time when you could be BUYING THIS GAME!!  Congratulations to Amazon and Toys R Us for noticing this gem.	22
Beautifully designed case.  It provides great TPU protection without adding bulk to the phone.  It fits great, nice and snug so you don't have to worry about it ever coming off on its own, while still able to remove if needed.  The color is stunning on the black phone, a nice deep jewel tone.  The sides provide nice grip, and I love the matte back.  The only issue is how difficult the power and volume buttons are to press, otherwise I would give it 5 stars.  I would buy more if it came in more colors.	7
I have tried my share of lip balms and have a collection of half used sticks that I might as well just throw away since I now plan to only buy Neutrogena's Norwegian Formula lip balm! It feels great when you put it on and the feeling lasts! I like to apply it before I work out and it lasts through a run or other activity where I will breathe through my mouth. Feels good to finally say good-bye to dry, flaky lips :)I also recommend the hand cream by Neutrogena's Norwegian Formula.. it is a great line!	4
"I purchased 12 of these late last year.  After 4 months of low to medium use, they stopped holding their charge -- even when not placed in a device.  I lost several camera opportunities when I found that all the batteries in my camera bag were dead just days after being charged.I still use them but make sure to drop them in the charger a few hours before they're to be used.  It's better than just throwing them away.  Definitely not ""Great for the environment"" if you end up throwing them away within 6 months. :("	12
"An affectionate remembrance of Renoir by his son, concentrating the years up to the turn of the century.Renoir considered himself an artisan rather than an artist, disliked anything artificial, from margarine to ready-to-wear clothes, had among his friends artists, and musicians who are household names today.  ""It is when you have lost your teeth that you can buy the best beefsteak"" he would say, and considering that he became more infirm with age, this truism affected him no less than the rest of us."	5
Originally got this for my knock-off IPad (called YourPad) and it worked fine for a while, then got glitchy and wouldn't open the book.  Tried removing & reinstalling, however that didn't work.  Got out the CHEAPER knock-off (iBridge), installed Kindle for Android and it has worked PERFECTLY ever since (knock on wood).  I love that I can take my current reading material ANYWHERE and read while I'm waiting at the Drs office or whereever.  Not my favorite app, but probably the most used one.	1
I use the Dunlop .60mm nylon picks as my current standard,  but decided to give the lighter .38mm a try.  Unfortunately,  the volume they produce get completely swallowed up when accompanying singing with an acoustic guitar (especially in an outdoor picnic setting),  and basically unusable for that purpose.  However, I did find these were just the ticket for personal practice, allowing me to hear a  metronome or backtrack far easier.  So although they failed my original performance intention, 5 stars for filling a need I didn't even know I had.  :)	16
I like this trash bag it fits the bill for me pretty well.  Just about the right size bag I'm not sure I would want it any bigger,I think it would get in your passengers way as they get in and out.  I really like the elastic closure on the top if it does get bumped nothing spills out.  Its also really easy to empty with the velcro along the bottom.  I use this in my work car and I am going to purchase another for my personal car.	10
This toy has many features.  It has four different buttons which each make a noise.  You can press elmo and he talks to you.  The fader works.  Then you rock the round part back and forth to play the music.  It plays several songs the only one I can reconginze is the sesame street song.  I think I liked this toy better then y son did though.  My son is 14 months old.  So far he will hit the elmo button to hear elmo talk but that is it,  It has a nice speaker and sounds very realistic.	22
I must say that this is one of my all time favourite albums. I have to say that the best rack is by far the detriot mix of &quot;What's Going On&quot;. At first I thought their was an  error in my speakers (marvin appears to only come from the left), but when the familiar harmony (Father, Father) came in on the right, I was completely blown away. Don't just take my word for it. Buy this album NOW and listen to perhaps the greatest album by one of the 20th Century's most gifted talents.	9
My dog likes this okay but it's not his first choice. The Nylabone DuraChew Hollow Stick Bacon is his first choice followed by the Nylabone Big Chews for Big Dogs Turkey Leg. Because he prefers the others this hasn't shown much wear yet. It was also really stuck to the packaging when I got it which was a bit strange and made me wonder if it was old. Plus it's a bit odd looking laying on the floor--almost like something that could be in an IKEA &#34;Tidy Up&#34; commercial. Lol.	19
I have never owned a &#34;Flat&#34; Whisk before.  Holy (Beep).  How did I ever live without one?  These whisks are so wonderful for gravy and so many other things.  The OXO Good Grips brand seems to be of high quality.  It has a great feel in your hand and doesn't feel too heavy or too light and the wires seem to have just the right amount of flexibility without feeling too weak or too rigid.  I love this whisk and use it all of the time.  A must have for serious cooks.	13
Having really enjoyed the Grand Trunk Ultralight hammock, I thought it would nice to buy a two person hammock for my wife and I. It is of good quality and as described, however, unless you like sleeping in a cocoon, you will not like this. It completely engulfs one person. You feel like you are in a stuffy tent. It's better for two, but mostly I just lay in it and this will not do for one. I will go back to the Grand Trunk Ultralight for single loafing.	20
"Simply the best! For a contractor you will use it more than you could possibly think. A lot of big box retaillers are not stocking this one any more, it is one of the few skill products worth a damn. The worm-drive is still durable, although they have cheapened it up over the years.  Buy extra blades, I have recently started using it for demo. sure beats getting beat up by the saw-z-all or sledge hammer, just have to figure a blade per job as ""overhead"".ZERO complaints. It just works."	21
I purchased these at the recommendation of my dentist.  I had gum surgery a few years ago, so I try to be careful, and these extra-soft brush heads are extremely gentle while still doing what they need to do.I usually switch to a new brush head every other month, so a package of 3 will last me 6 months.  I use this Oral-B toothbrushOral-B Professional Healthy Clean Floss Action Precision 5000 Rechargeable Electric Toothbrush(packaging may vary), and this brush head fits fine.I liked these so much I now have them on subscribe and save.	12
I have liked sliding games in the past and this one for the Kindle fits the bill. Graphics are simple but colorful. The music is very pleasant and not irritating. Game play may be a bit slow on certain touched, but overall not bad. The only thing I do not like is the fact that I think it might be almost impossible to make the target score. Every square you move to counts as one move. The movement of one piece should count as one no matter how far you move. Download and enjoy!	1
If you're not a cook, then you probably won't have a use for this, but anyone in the search of a superior vegetable peeler, look no further. I've had mine for over two years, and it's working as well as the day I purchased it. It doesn't dull, it peels efficiently, it's safe, light, easy to handle, easy to clean, and doesn't rust. It works well with potatoes, carrots, cucumbers, and zucchinis. I've never tried chocolate, though. It's crazily cheap that you should definitely give this product a try. I promise you won't be disappointed.	13
We use it for our camping knives...a long blade machete and a 4.5&#34; fixed blade knife. It keeps them nice and sharp. I also love that the cover snaps onto the stones to create a handle, therefore saving space...perfect for outdoor utility.As someone who works in a professional kitchen and has experience sharpening knives, I know that it's easy to wreck your blades if your not sharpening right. I wish this stone came with thorough instructions, but it doesn't so be sure to read up on the internet to make sure you're doing it right!	20
This item is not top quality.  I don't have too many of this company's other products, so if this is an example of their quality than I don't think I will.  First off the cover does not open without popping off the hinge and needing to be reattached, the batteries only lasted through two cd's, the volume doesn't get very high, and it doesn't even fit on the side of our crib.  Being in the baby business they should know that not all crib's are made the same.  You are much better off just getting a simple boom box that play's cd's.	3
They really missed an opportunity here.The background story is great; model dies, and comes back in the body of an overweight, brilliant lawyer.There's no real storyline. The model is going through some crisis over her changed identity, a client shows up with a  problem that relates to what she is going through, she wins the case.That pretty much sums up every episode.The end of the season finale was intriguing so I'll probably watch season two but if it doesn't pick up I won't bother with the other seasons.	0
This is a wonderful game that I recently introduced to my 5yo, and have fond memories of playing when I was younger.  My only complaint is the poor quality of the boards.  We have trouble with the plastic picture holders not opening or closing completely, and coming off when we *very gently* flip open pieces at the start of a new game.  It's quite frustrating having to deal with the poor quality of this great game, especially when this problem *never* occurred with the older version(s).  A wonderful teaching tool and fun game, but be prepared to deal with the poor quality.	22
Bankers Boxes are ubiquitous for a reason. They're sturdy, long lasting (if you don't abuse them), and help make order of mounds of files and paperwork. The boxes are easy to put together and I especially like the double thick bottom. My only issue is that I received the string-tie, flap top boxes instead of the ones with lids, but otherwise they're pretty much the same. Be aware that if you pack the box completely full it will be quite heavy, so use caution when lifting.	17
This was an incredible read and a quick read if you want something to captivate you for a trip.  For fictional history it's clear the author did her homework.  The author took many real events and spun them into the journey of a fictional character through a composite circus during the depression.  The story is exciting and hard to put down.  The intro leaves you wondering throughout the whole story.  Its very easy to relate to the main character and feel what he feels, stress, confusion, love...  I can't say much else without giving away the books little secrets.	5
I've used many different types of hummingbird feeders, and it isn't possible to get a better one than this three-portal Aspects model. Hummers fight like mad, so more ports are a waste. Sugar water naturally ferments fast in warm weather, so you don't need more capacity. The built in ant moat is pretty good against smallish ants, and is a freebie. The plastic construction won't break if you drop it on a rock or it blows off. And, it is so easy to rinse and fill.You simply cannot buy a better designed or better built hummingbird feeder.	18
As a body oil it's just fine.... I like to use a cap full in a bath. It makes my skin very soft. It will make your bathtub just disgusting though, you will have to clean it after.But the smell.... It's not my favorite to begin with, but it's ok. It's just SO strong!!!!! I give it 3 stars because it works well and does what it supposed to, but I actually don't use it. I can't handle the scent, or its strength of scent I guess.	4
Ordered this to leave connected to an HDMI port on the upstairs TV so my wife could connect her tablet to the TV. It works great and appears well made and should last a long time, especially where only the mini-HDMI connector will the inserted and removed multiple times. No issues with it being loose, weak, or ready to break. Hard to beat the price with a nominal shipping charge. It arrived in its own bag inside of a shipping bag in perfect condition, and the shipping was exactly when they said it would be.	10
I listen to a wide variety of music, and I think that Alison Krauss has the most beautiful voice in all of today's music.  The pop acts of today can't compare.  &quot;I've Got That Old Feeling&quot; has 12 exceptional songs from bluegrass to country including the title song, &quot;It's Over&quot;, and &quot;Wish I Still Had You&quot;.  Not only can Krauss sing, she plays the violin to perfection.  If you haven't listened to Alison Krauss yet, you are in for a treat!	9
Much has been said about this movie and you've probably heard all you need to hear about it.  To me, it was a violent albeit beautifully made movie.  It has heart; it's brutal, poignant, moving, and heart breaking.  It's obvious Mel Gibson poured his heart and soul into the making of The Passion of the Christ.  Was it anti-Semitic?  I didn't think so.With all the controversy swirling around The Passion, my best recommendation is to go see the movie and decide for yourself.	15
These are easy to use and I only had to use 2 sheets of plain paper to get them aligned. It works fine with my cannon printer but I prefer to put them in 1 at a time. I didn't have a problem with these but I one had a problem with the printer taking more than one sheet then it wanted to jam.I like the size they are big enough to clearly see the address but not too big to take up too much space.I several pages with return addresses and I will save some for addressing envelopes at Christmas time.	17
I've used the Jorgensen Bar Clamps for years. Bought some other clamps as they were cheaper.  Over the years I know when I am picking up a Jorgensen Clamp.  Fit and finish does well in my workshop which rusts tools! Needed a good vise. It was highly rated and I am impressed by the company. Have yet to install it but it looks well made and it is sturdy.Down side is they need to have a better set of instructions. Can't find anything when I Google it. Some You Tube Videos by ambitious woodworkers, but companies should be doing it!	21
Love the battery life, look and size, but have found the sound inferior to my  bottom-of-the-line HS 805.  Frequent static.And then the topper--whenever it is on, the blue light on the side blinks.  The instructions say that this stops after five minutes, or that it can be disabled by holding the two volume buttons.  Both are lies.  Maybe some twenty-something year old designer thought it was way cool to walk around with a big blinking LED on the side of your head, but I can't use this in a business setting.  It's going back.	7
I actually wasn't aware of this gauge of string until I purchased a guitar from the great George Lynch. The strings felt different than the 9s I use on my Fenders and the 10s I use on my Gibsons. So the next time I saw George, I asked him what strings he put on that guitar and he told me D'Addario 9.5s. I love them on my Mr Scary Guitars Burnt Tiger and that is the only brand/gauge of string that I will ever put on that guitar! I definitely recommend trying out a set.	16
This was purchased for my S&W; M&P; .40 handgun. It can take a little bit to get it on JUST RIGHT, but once you find that perfect position, it's gold. Numbers aren't the smoothest, but it does what it is intended to do. Like I said, just take a little bit of time to set it up.Overall, I'm pleased with the extra level of safety I now have when transporting it in the car, and you just can't beat the price and fast shipping!	20
"After reading all the reviews on-line for this product I chose to register for it, now that I am using it I am disappointed.  I'm not sure if my sense of smell is just that of super hero's or my daughter has super smelly diapers.  Either way her room does have the smell of dirty diapers when you enter and the ""Champ"" is in the back corner of the room.  I guess I'm just grateful that the whole house doesn't smell as bad as her room."	3
Even for dogs that are 'hard chewers', this toy is wonderful!  Yes, they can,, and will, eventually wear down parts of the toy {esp the head and tail} from gnawing on it, but it doesn't break off into small pieces as some toys can.  I've used this for big and small dogs, and they all love it equally!  I think the 'bumps' on the surface of the toy help stimulate the teeth/gums, and it must feel good when they chew on it.  Great toy!	19
Lets face it, its not worth putting an expensive scope on a .22 rifle.  I put this on my Remington 597 plinker rifle and it works great.  I shot a few hundred rounds this last weekend at 50 yards and had no problems with the scope.  For [...] bucks, its a steal!  The scope is built well and comes with a wrench for the scope rings.  The scope is easy to sight in as well.  You can't really use your fingers, but you can use a spent casing or coin to turn it.	20
Hi,I've been using Cetaphil for years now.  I first bought after reading reviews in Allure magazine and I wasn't disappointed one bit!! It's the best, non drying and non-abrasive cleanser I've ever used... and while it is a bit pricey (I'm pretty cheap lol) it's worth it and the bottle (used by my eldest daughter and myself) lasts us 6 months!  And you can use it without water if you needed too!  It's amazing!Honestly, I will use this stuff forever.  :)LOVE it!	4
I've tried several different strings on electric, and Ernie Ball Slinkys are the only ones I really trust on all of my guitars.  The fact that they also happen to be among the cheapest strings you can find is a nice bonus.  But they sound great, and are far less prone to breakage than other brands I have tried.  The 9's are super fast and easy to bend, but I've started using 10's more often on my Strats, which creates an even more robust sound.  They're an industry standard for a reason - you don't need 15 dollar strings!	16
"I've been using a Crybaby for going on 30 years now.  Some guitarists claim that having them in your signal chain affects your tone in a negative way.  Well, I've never noticed.To me these always feel perfect.  Also, you can adjust which part of the sweep you're using very easily - ie if you want more treble or bass you just the little ""comb"" that moves the wheel on the pot.I've tried other wahs.  Morley doesn't do it for me, and the Vox is very good, I just have always gone with what I knew.  No complaints with the Crybaby."	16
We were pretty disappointed with this shampoo and conditioner. Had high hopes for it, and it did not deliver.The smell was okay.It was harsh and stripping on the hair follicles.Left our hair with that squeaky clean feeling, but not in a good way, more in a removed all the oil from your hair kinda away.Even in using the conditioner, my hair still looked frizzy. And I do not have frizzy hair! Mine is fine, thin, and straight. If anything I usually border on having my hair be too silky and need things to volumize it.Just cannot recommend this product.	4
Grim Fandango combines every element you look for in an adventure game in a fluent and involving fashion.  The plot, the comedy, the political intrigues, an occasional romance...  All right here!  One of the things I found most amusing was, whenever Manny (the main character)  manages to build his life (or is it death?) up again, you (the player)  takes over and manages to ruin it in a day!  (Whew, think I got enough  parenthesis in!)  If you enjoy an easy-going adventure game with a great  story to tell, this game's for you!	23
I bought these for my boyfriend for Christmas and he loves them!  Unfortunately, I also love to wear them.  Haha.  The waistband is awesome.  Really well-made.One recommendation, though.  This is the second pair of these pants that we've purchased.  He put the other pair through the dryer and they are not nearly as soft anymore.  We hung this pair to dry and washed them in cold; they're in great shape!  I'd recommend cold wash and hang dry.	8
The very first Grand Theft Auto is likely the most forgotten, and for good reasons. Though there is fun to be had in this game, it is marred by one of the worst control schemes I have ever experienced, the top-down camera is awful, and the combat mechanics suck. The graphics are quite ugly as well. The overall presentation is a mess because of poor development skills the development team had apparently. Like I said this title is passable overall, but it is marred by some huge issues which is probably why it's forgotten.	23
This brand of almond flour is very, very fine grain. This leads to a superior texture when used in cakes, cookies, and other treats. For those purposes, I'd say this is vastly better than Bob's Red Mill.That being said, Bob's Red Mill's larger grain almond flour might be better for crusted chicken and such. It would depend on your preference.I'm very pleased with the quality and price of the product. I highly recommend it for low carb,gluten free, and/or grain free folks!	11
I see that the reviewer below hasn't heard the news. Trent has planned on releasing this on DVD. There was some protesting from his ex-manager about it, but now that the battle in court is over, Trent can re-release this. The DVD should be out before too long, so anyone planning on buying this version should wait. It's rumored that the DVD version will include the Broken movie and the videos he's released since the VHS of Closure. Until then, you can watch most of the songs on NIN.com, albeit with crappy quality.	6
I wanted a heating pad so I figured I'd get the whole kit.  This kit is a bit disappointing because the plastic dome does not fit well on the base so there is an air gap.  I have this sitting on a wooden floor and the heater has worked fine.  I just think it was very overpriced for what I got.  The plastic parts are thin and would require me to be careful if I want to use them for years to come.  I had hoped for better.	18
These 501's were exactly what I was seeking for my son, though they can be purchased in W.A. the different washes are not available. I really wanted the 'Rigids' and they are not here. To find I could buy them on 'Amazon' but shipping outside of 'US' was not available, was really OFF!So many things in the last 4 months are not available for shipping outside the 'US'. It sometimes takes a long time to find everything and it's not until one checks out to discover the item-s are not available for shipping.What can I say.	8
This game has been around for quite awhile but it is a winner! The object of the game is to move the red car out of the traffic jam. Each card tells you how to place all of the cars. You have to systematically move the cars back and forth to allow cars to move around to create a path, sometime a square at a time, for the red car to get out!  This is great for home and the classroom. This game can also be used during indoor recess. It is a quick game.	22
This is a great cymbal stand sturdy, tight, well made, using it with a 18&#34; crash and does not move or rattle, amazingly well constructed stand for the price, going to replace my other flimsy stands with a few of these, great product. I am not a giging drummer and do not take apart and dismantle the stand at all, but it is a great stand for my studio/practice kit. Being honest don't know how it would be for a gigging drummer, but for what I am using it for, more than does the job.	16
I purchased these based on the wonderful reviews, I have a black pair from Sketchers that I loved that I figured would be similar..not really.  These just putting them on, HURT, I had to jam my feet in them (due to that non moving elastic (?) piece on the top where the laces would be) to get them in.  I can't really walk comfortable but am hoping that maybe they need time to stretch?  I don't have wide feet and never needed any special type of shoe but these were really tight across the top!!	8
My brother and I used to play this game for hours on end. Yes, we would send each other back to the beginning of the game while laughing our little heads off in amusement. If you play the game enough, everyone gets a chance to win. So, most times we would play this until each person had a chance to win. A great colorful game with easy to move pawns. Great family fun, but easy enough for kids to take out the game on a rainy day and entertain themselves.~The Rebecca Review	22
Merrell's WERE great, perhaps when they were made in Canada. These are identical in stated sizing to a wonderful pair of Merrell Jungle Moc's I wore comfortably in and out of the house for years, but my heel slipped a lot in these, there was way too much toe room, and they seemed 1/2 to 1 size too large. I wear a 9.5 US Merrell but these felt like 10-10.5's. I had to return them for properly fitting and comfortable Teva's. I do not recommend these, I would not buy again, and I hope this helps someone.	8
I ordered this polish to clean up my aluminum wheels as demonstrated on a YouTube video. It did a good job with the wheels but I also tried it on the oxidized headlight lenses of the car as well. I didn't use any powered buffing wheel as I wasn't sure of the effect on the plastic. However, it didn't take too much rubbing to totally restore the clarity of the lenses. I've also used this on brass and it really worked there too. A little bit goes a long way so this tube should last quite a while.	2
Ive been using this since like the 6th grade (Im 26 now). I use it probably 1-2x a week and its amazing. It helps minimize pores and kill current pimples. Its very easy to use. I just put it on, go do the dishwasher or something and then take a shower and get it off. I take it off in the shower with water/soap and then follow it up with the mint julep facial scrub. When I get out of the shower my face is smooth, pores are reduced and my skin is glowing.The bottle lasts forever too!	4
"First off, this is NOT a ""bubble-popper"" game.  Believe me, i hate those!  I already played bejeweled when facebook was new, and that was it for me.  This is about patterns and figuring out how to clear the board utilizing new criteria for how you're allowed to do so with each higher level.  The story/dialogue has always seemed odd and fairly extraneous to me.  But i have played through this game about 4 times, each on a different device.  It is flawless."	1
"this stuff is a poor example of an authentic 5-spice powder which I paid $1.5 for 4oz locally, despite the fact that other Dynasty products are useful such as their Satay sauce.  I live walking distance to Flushing Queens, and have a good idea what it's supposed to taste like from authentic Asian cooking sold nearby. If you want to go cheap off Amazon, you are better off withFrontier Five Spice Powder, 1.92-Ounce Bottle.  BTW ""star anise"" or ""aniseed"" is already a licorice flavor, so to add even more licorice to this bottle was foolish."	11
Let me tell you, backing up a 35 foot camper is a pain when you only have the stock mirrors!!!! These made all those troubles disappear and might have saved my marriage too. My wife can't seem to get the hang guiding me back. There was usually lots of yelling and cussing involved!!! Anyway these mirrors work great and are very easy to take on and off. I've had them on at 85 mph and they didn't even budge. And no the camper wasn't hooked up at the time!!!	2
"These are good - but not great - coffee beans.  I like a bit of a ""bite"" from my coffee, and prefer a really good French Roast - of which many are not ""really good."" Starbucks French Roast is one of the most consistent, but even their outrageously high-priced blend has disappointed me of late. The Lavazza is a more mellow blend, which I find drinkable but without that morning ""slap in the face"" you get from a heartier roast. Does that make sense?"	11
Noticeable difference almost instantly.  I was surprised.  I am somewhat crazy when it comes to maintenance on my vehicles.  I reagularly do the required maintenance before it is required.  When I changed the gear lube in my axles (front and rear) it felt like someone had &#34;unlocked&#34; the truck.  there was a noticeable difference in drag. The vehicle seems to accelerate easier, and less pedal was required to keep it moving.  I knew this was good stuff, but I was pleasantly surprised after changing the oil.  I notice very similar results after every engine oil change.  no joke.	2
I would not say I liked or disliked this story. I don't mind a real short one once in a while, but it is really difficult with romance because I really want more character development and more time to understand their relationship. I liked the hero and heroine, but I think I am going to stick to the regular length romance. They are still a short read, between 4 and 5 hours, but the characters are so much more developed. I can't complain though as it only cost 99 cents.	14
Perhaps most famous for Dorothy Mcguire's sensitive performance as a mute servant girl pursued by a maniac, this elegant thriller looks wonderful on the DVD version. No special features to speak of except a trailer, but the film itself is clean, crisp, and presented in its original 1:33 aspect ratio. Beautiful photography and some polished performances by a great supporting cast (including Rhonda Fleming and Ethel Barrymore) compensate for a mystery many viewers may solve a bit early. Old fashioned in all the right ways, this intriguing and entertaining film is well worth the price.	15
This is my favirote skin product to pamper myself with. The smell really isn't that great (I think they need to introduce something which really does smell like apricots), but it is very effective at removing dirt and oil from the skin.This product should be applied in the bath or shower. It is very messy and has a tendency to glop everywhere. Plus the acne medication can stain fabrics.I also strongly recomend purchases of the larger sizes because I go through the little tubes on a regular basis.	12
I think I would have really liked this book had it not been the descriptions of size for the male lead.  I mean c'mon!!!!  There really is such a thing as 'too big' and this is up there with HELL NO!  Every time I started to get back into the story and care about the characters here comes another description of 'the cannon'.  It just got to be utterly ridiculous!  And EVERY male is of that proportion?  Not to repeat myself but really, ridiculous!	14
An interesting way to showcase circus history & a way of life that is no more.Although this is a fictionalized account, it was based on bits & pieces of fact from Circus History.The photographs were the best.They were a nice addition to the book.The nursing home drama/tie-in was a bit too much.I guess it was a play on the theme of running away to join the circus...Just never heard of someone who ran away from a nursing home in a wheel chair to join the circus & was successful with it!	5
TuneIn radio is an excellent app. For some esoteric reason, our local AM and FM stations are practically unintelligible - this application has given us a clear and reliable alternative to constantly looking for the right configuration of dial position, antenna placement, and mojo.TuneIn has a variety of useful features including a timer, alarm, presets, and a surprisingly good search function. I especially like how the search will group talk shows by how much time is remaining. It's nice to be able to catch that talk radio program at the beginning!	1
i have tried many brands and types of bottle brush and now i finally found the one.this brush is just enough soft and flexible to clean bottles well. The bristles are soft and yet sturdy to withstand pressure. Unlike rubber/silicone based brush whose bristles have no strength to stand straight, this will easily clean corner without having to jam the brush into the corner.Another good feature is the lenght, it is around a foot long, so you can use it to clean your vacuum flask/thermos easily as well.	12
This television movie based on the best selling autobiography of country veterinarian James Herriot came before the popular BBC television series. Simon Ward, Anthony Hopkins and Lisa Harrow star in this charming little tale about the new vet who moves a to Yorkshire farming community in the 1930's. Along the way he not only wins his neighbors over but also finds romance. Directed by Claude Whatham, this 1974 film does not have the depth of the television series, but you can clearly see why people would want more of the same on a more regular basis.	15
One of the best cases I've ever bought for a phone.Very snug fit,w/o any pull-away around the cutouts for the I-R Blaster/3.5mm audio jack/USB port.The volume rocker is covered & actually functions better than w/o a case.The case looks & feels as if it is actually a part of the phone,yet,should provide more than adequate protection against everyday use & occasional misuse/accidental bumps/etc.....Also a great value,as I paid less than $5.00,definitely a must-buy for any HTC ONE owner.	7
ES File Explorer is great, I believe one of the best out there for your Android device, but this was built for a specific revision and may not want to work on yours.  Keep searching, the latest versions are here and work fantastic.  ES goes above and beyond with copy, move, delete and more functions in a clean layout that's customizable but WORKS.  Many I tried were missing a command or required tons of clicking to get something simple done.  ES eliminated most of that stress and hasn't failed.	1
This is a great storage bin for dog food.  We actually didn't pour out the food, in an effort to keep the container cleaner, but instead just put the opened bag inside.  It works very well.  This also allows us to keep a bag of treats inside too.  The container seals well and moves quite easily.  We only store a 20 lb bag of food inside and a small bag of treats, but there is plenty of room for more.  I would highly recommend this for anyone that needs to store a large bag of pet food.	19
This Conair hot brush has so much quality built in at a sper low price.  Even auto-shut-off!Great size for short to median hair or just curly styles.  Many heat temp selections sogentle on hair.  Use on DRY hair !  Heats fast, easy to hold without burning fingers.Better than curling iron because it grips the hair easily.  Same results, but much faster.Leaves hair super shiny as the barrel is ceramic.  Nothing else on the market that has this muchquality at such a low, low price.VERY, VERY SATISFIED CUSTOMER !!!	4
This is the best app, ever! Very easy to use. I have it on my kindle and my droid razr, so it's very easy to keep my food intake up to date. It has meals from most of the franchise restaurants that my husband and I frequent, as well as name brand items from the grocery store, so calories are super easy to enter.  It recognizes all the strength and aerobic exercises from my gym, so it's easy to enter exercise info. AND it even keeps track of my water intake! I love it!	1
This version is completely non-functional.  It's old, and from before Twidroyd had their API key suspended from the market.  It was out of date even on Amazon's launch day.  If you want to use this app, go to the market.  Hopefully they'll update this here and this review won't apply, but right now it's an old out of date app that doesn't work.  Honestly, this concerns me about the whole Amazon market concept.  If a developer isn't going to update apps here, and if it were a paid app, you'd be out of luck.	1
I ordered 3 of them, 2 of them came without an issue, but the 1 that had problem, it got very very difficult to get it replaced, the company I ordered from told me to go to Jabra directly, at Jabra website, after entering all the info as per requested, they simply send me an email to how to resolve it and after trying that and notify them again via email (no phone #), and I've asked for an exchange and again, they replied to ask me to do the same process again, it's never ending. Bad customer service.	7
I use it to pre-treat my carpet in heavy stained spots, but it's also VERY handy for when my puppy has accidents here and there. Instead of cleaning my carpet all over again (no way, it takes too much time), I just spray this and clean it off. I think this works better than the concentrated 2X formula, not to mention its scent is even better. If you own a puppy or a pet that isn't fully housebroken yet, buy it. You'll be glad you have something that cleans your carpet easily and fast without the use of a cleaner.	19
I bought this CD back in August and I have only listened to it once(when I needed music to fall asleep to when there was nothing on the radio). I have heard that this CD is &quot;depressing&quot;, but when I heard it, I found  nothing depressing about. Maybe it was because I wasn't concentrating fully  on it, but I wasn't impressed. Maybe if I looked at the lyrics(if I could  find them) and found the true meaning of the songs I would like it better.  Maybe when I listen to it again, I'll give it a better review.	9
I bought these for $13 incl. shipping so that was a great deal. I received the extra soft heads like I ordered. The brushheads work great with no issues. If you're thinking about saving a few bucks by buying the generic ones at walmart, don't. I did and they are not the same and are vastly inferior. They had a strong vibration to them that actually hurt my teeth and gums and were a lot noisier. Going back to the official heads made me appreciate how quiet and smooth the brush and handle operated.	12
Podcasting on a bit of a budget ($200 setup), I wanted good sound quality, nice warm tones .... these mics deliver in a world where I didn't quite have the cash for condensers I wanted.  I needed four mics and this was the best cheap option and my word, these sound great.  3 for under $40 was fantastic.  I am glad I didn't break budget here.  I'm using these with the Behringer 1202FX mixer.  I am so extremely happy with them.	16
I've been using Borghese/Kirkland face serum for a few years and love it.  I decided to try the Regenerist products and purchased the eye serum, face serum and daily moisturizer.  I read all of the positive reviews about the face serum but wasn't expecting it to be any better than the Borghese/Kirkland.  I'm pleasantly surprised.  It has a similar gel-like consistency but seems to absorb more quickly.  For that reason, it feels lighter on my skin.  I guess I'm a convert.	4
This is the WORST transfer of a movie that I have ever seen.  Does Twentieth Century Fox know what was done with this movie?  They released it originally but I guess they are not responsible for the devastation that has ensued.  It is so poorly done that there are wavy lines at times and the color goes in and out.  It was supposed to be a digital transfer but it is a travesty.  This should never have been allowed to be released.  The original company that did this, CCM, should be severely chastized for even thinking about putting their name on it!	6
My fav look out of the V911's.  Same as the other versions, nimble quick and agile. The color scheme really stands out in the air and always looks mean ;)The EXTRA parts it came with was jus ridiculously great, but it DID NOT COME WIT UPGRADED BATTERIES ;(*UPDATE*After 2 months of abuse it has held up well. Few tail rotors replaced but other than that were still perfect. *Binded it with an advanced Wl remote and it totally unlocked even more rates and adjustability. Keeps getting better ;)ALSO, DOSENT HANDLE VERY WELL OUTSIDE	22
I thought this would be a little bigger, but that's okay since my American Pitbull Terrier is only 5 months right now, and my Ridgeback mix is medium sized. This is a great size for small-medium Dogs. It's an interesting shape and my Moms cairn terrier mix female claimed it right away! Haha. It's textured for teeth cleaning and strong for super chewers! As with any hard chew toy, do keep an eye on your pet while they chew so they don't hurt a tooth. Ive heard that this can be a problem.	19
Wasn't sure what to expect with this, but it works flawlessly and it is very easy to use, as well as very portable.  Probably my only complaints are that you do have to read the manual very carefully to understand the various colors and blinks of the lights, but once you know your way around it - the device just works.  Callers cannot tell you are on a bluetooth and you can hear the callers very clearly.  It has exceeded my expectations.  Plan to get another one for our second car now.	7
I got lots of information about fish from ppl. who sold them evidently someone went over a short care chart about fish, water conditions,how important it is to get a API Master Kit, Cycling your fish, knowing the fish capability chart having the fish that are best for all newbies. I'm happy I can order the liquid API Nitrite and ammonia without having to purchase the whole API Master kit.I purchased  Seachem Matrix to keep good bacteria flowing thu my filter all the time keeping me from losing fish ,knowing I've done all I can to make my lil pals  &#34;Happy&#34;!	19
I purchased this based on the good reviews I read, and had confidence that it would live up to them. It didn't. This mascara smudges and smears very easily. It's allergy season, so my eyes tear a little... but just from that it streaked under my eyes! Other mascaras don't do this at all. The mascara goes on nicely and separates your lashes well, but I can't give it a three-star rating because I can't use it and had to throw it in the trash.	4
Its hot stuff like horseradish is. Throw in some green coloring and VIOLA you have &#34;wasabi&#34;. It is obvious this is NOT Wasabi root, the original Japanese sushi and sashimi spice. Says so right on the pack. Worse is the great price at $1.99 until you notice the shipping at $5.25 making the total ACTUAL price $7.24. Pick it up at your local grocery store in the Asian section for $1.79. Wish Amazon would make vendors clarify BOTH cost UP FRONT instead of the old bait and switch. No sale.	11
I am very impressed with the quality of this skirt; it is very well made.  This is our seven month old daughter's first holiday and her elf just arrived tonight on Thanksgiving Eve.  We added this skirt and other accessories of our own to personalize her a bit more.  She now has a pom-pom on her hat, a bow, and even pearl earrings!  She looks so sweet!  I uploaded a picture...check it out :)I highly recommend the skirt if your elf is a female.  It really adds something special to this already spectacular elf!  Happy holidays :)	22
There are mixed feelings about using a hydrometer to measure specific gravity of the water. but there are some ways to keep on getting accurate readings. one is , pour water in slowly, make sure all the fresh water is out so measure the first time and then dump it and measure again. Normally that gives the more accurate reading.  and always make sure there is no bubbles on the measuring unit. bubbles can greatly affect the reading.  Definitely a lot cheaper than a refractometer. I will get one later but for now this will do, since im just starting.	19
This is the third book of his that I have read and I really enjoy them. They have great plots and characters, but aren't  overly complicated. My husband and I have a second home in Rancho Mirage (which is in the Coachella Valley) and we go to Palm Springs a lot and it's fun to read about a place that I know so well. I love his attention to detail and descriptive way of writing that draws you into his books. I would definitely recommend his books and I already have!	14
"ive been using this product for the past month or so.  i have 2 dogs and a cat.  it does nothing for flea control.  infact, in seems like they have more fleas now than before.  i think the fleas love the garlic!  the dogs love the taste of the chewable tabs.  the dogs breath smells like garlic.  i'll continue to use the product cause the dogs love the ""treat"" so much.  but wont buy it again for flea control."	11
Super Mario 64(1997) When I first got Nintendo 64,it came with Super Mario 64.When the system was hooked up,I put in the game,and was amazed on how the graphics were!It was excellent.The graphics were great,the music was cool,and Mario never looked better!This game is for everyone.I thought Banjo-Kazooie was a great game,but move over Banjo,Mario is back!The best game ever.Features new worlds,characters,setting,and don't worry some of the old villians from the early Mario games are here,and can't forget Bowser and Princess Toadstool(Peach).Better than any 64 game ever made!	23
Okay so I'm sure everyone has their preferences. I haven't tried everyone on the market - but of the ones I have, these are the best. I try not touch my exterior of my car with anything, but if I have to these are the only ones I trust. They are the softest and thickest Microfiber I have ever owned. I use them more regularly for wiping down my interior, windows, and mirrors. They wash well, and there's no left over tag bits or rough parts on the towel. Meguiar always has great products, IMO.	2
this is weird cause  my mom was on her phone my bro was on the computer and my tv was going and it didn't pick up anything and they were all by each other so it should put off a strong signal but it didn't so that's weird the. first time I turned it on it was picking up strange moving signals and it said stuff like cow and none and other stuff and the second time it didn't  pick up anything up so the gohsts escaped without letting me know. (FREAKY)letting me know freaky.	1
Backyardigans is a very innocent show for young children.  It lacks the subtle double entendre of some cartoons but it's good to have a resource that is just nice.  It is more than suitable for my littler guys and I never feel a need to monitor their viewing or censor any of it.  But the best part is the music.  I've never really thought of children's fare in terms of the music before but this shows what can be done in the right hands.  Perhaps it isn't for everyone, but my kids really enjoy singing along.  Bang up job, guys!	0
I have four covered trays made by Tupperware, I was trying to save a buck, bought four of these because I have liked other Oxo products.  It was a mistake.  While these work, the cubes are small, the trays are difficult to fill and cap without spilling water, and they are clunky in the freezer compartment.  All I did was compromise, buy and waste my money, and now I need to go pay the full price for the Tupperware trays that work and that I should have bought to start with.	13
I like the ombre look. So i decided to try this after all of the tutorials Ive watched.Long story short, I think this look is okay.....Its definitely looks better with your hair curled, like a light wavy....But thats just my opinion....Its a very nice product, everything you need is right there in the box.You can achieve any look with this.i will say my first time, my hair did turn brassy copper color.But i bought a second box by accident and re did my color, and its a nice honey blonde.....	4
I am very happy with the speakers they are great. They are not the loudest out there but it's amazing that they are as loud as they are considering the satelites fit in the palm of your hand.My only complaint is that Yamaha was offering a rebate when I bought these speakers and I sent in all  the nessecary stuff, reciept, rebate form and the UPC from the box. Then I  got a postcard from Yamaha saying that they needed the UPC. And since I  sent them the original I was out of luck.	10
I don't find the boxer briefs particularly comfortable.  The angled seams are irritating. I can't speak to the usual, &#34;you can wear them for an extended period&#34;, portion of other reviews as I find them so uncomfortable that I can't keep them on for longer than 30 minutes.  The build quality it good, I don't find the material particulary soft and comfortable either.  The fit is good as well.I won't take them down below 3 stars as each body is different.	8
"The last of Stevie's 80s albums, this one isn't as solid and robust as 1985's ""In Square Circle,"" but, like any Stevie album, still has its share of redeeming moments. Features one of his best 80s ballads ""You Will Know,"" and the funky ""Dark 'N' Lovely"" which sounds more like some of his late 70s/early 80s funk numbers rather than something from 1987. Also spawned a hit with ""Skeletons"" which is really not one of his better songs (very melodically bland). Still worth hearing if you're unfamiliar with it, as there is no such thing as a completely disposable Stevie Wonder album."	9
Read all the reviews before buying it and had expected more.  But in reality I really should not have since I didn't pay too much for it.  The main thing that really dislike about it is that the collapsing mechanism isn't stiff enough and I find I have to make sure I'm putting it on with both hands or else the headphones will fold in.  Other than that I think it is okay.  I'm not much of an audiophile so I'll leave the sound quality and what not to those in the know.	10
"I'm actually a travel agent, and I purchased these to use in plastic luggage tags that I give to my clients.  They work just fine.  I do find that the edges look a little better than other brands that I've tried, though because of the way I use them, that's not as much of an issue for me, it certainly would be if you're actually using them as your business card.  On other brands, you will sometimes see a little ""fiber"" around the card, and you don't see that with these."	17
Being a very busty woman, I'm constantly looking for a bra that will smooth and minimize my proportions. Bali is a trusted name in intimate apparel, so I tried out this bra. I love the way it feels and how it makes me look when I wear tee shirts and sweaters. It runs true to size, so I didn't need to return it for a larger size. I recommend this bra to women who have the same problem as I do with finding a bra that will fit and look good!	8
Better tasting than Knox -- or any other gelatin they sell in the local grocery.I add a teaspoon to a bowl of bone broth. For some reason (either due to overcooking or because of the type of bones I'm able to get) my bone broth doesn't always gel -- which means the gelatin from the bones either got broken down during cooking or wasn't there to start with. So I add Bernard Jensen's gelatin to make up for the lack of gelatin in my broth.The bottle lasts me about a year.	11
The unit works boosting weak cell phone signals.If you are in a area with a fairly strong signal, the data rate seemed to be slower when using the booster. I would attribute this to the inherent signal delay introduced by the booster - which probably does not affect voice calls, so don't expect higher data rates when using the booster with a data card. On the other hand, when using a data card where the external signal is VERY weak, the data card was unable to keep a reliable data connection, but the signal was still usable for a voice connection.	7
&#34;An American Christmas Carol &#34;is different in some ways from the original &#34; A Christmas Carol &#34;. At least the characters names are changed in this movie. I have seen many versions of this story and have enjoyed all of them.This is not my most favorite version of all,but it is maybe my fourth favorite.I like the original story better, that is why I gave it 4 stars.It does do a good job of telling the story of Scrooge, even with the name changes. It is the same general idea. I would recommend it to anyone who likes the original story.	15
"What can I say about the Cars first album. The Cars debut album has to be one of the most impressive albums that I have ever heard. Why can't bands make albums this great anymore? Three big hit singles ""Good Times Roll"",""Just What I Needed"", and ""My Bestfriend's Girl"". As well as ""Bye, Bye Love"", ""Moving in Stereo"", and ""YOu're All I've Got Tonight"" that each get a lot of radio play as well. This is one of those rare albums that is great from start to finish, no filler here."	9
I never thought Enya would reach the sublime heights of Evacuee or Marble Halls from 'Shepherd Moons.' 'The Celts, Watermark and Day...' were all pleasant and admirable throughout, but are less ambitious both lyrically and musically. But Hope Has a Place from 'Memory...' reaches those heights and beyond. It is Enya at her most inspirational and comforting. I'm actually glad that this song didn't get overexposed the way Only Time did. It makes it that much more special to all who own this album.	6
Hearing Nick Drake for the first time was quite a revelation.  The guitar playing was so intriguing and...different.  And his voice really caught my attention.  This disc is awesome-I would say as perfect as an acoustic folk album can be.  &quot;Place to be&quot; and &quot;Which will&quot; are especially powerful.  No frills on this disc, just a man and a guitar.  There is an atmosphere of sadness that pervades this disc, it's great to put on when you have a lot on your mind.  It helps me slow down.  Essential.	9
...and I realized it's not weak; it's smooth. The farther into the cup I got, the more I was won over. This will be one of my most-consumed teas. It arrived today and already I'm on my second cup, with no slow down in sight. I recommend using two *heaping* teaspoons per cup.It would be nice if Amazon would offer this size as a stand-alone item that can be ordered without having to order it as an add-on. I am not a fan of the add-on restrictions, and I'd gladly pay shipping if Amazon would allow it.	11
"My daughter loves Bear, and especially Tutter. So when we saw this video we though this would be a great way to introduce potty training to her.She watched the video a couple of times, but it did not interest her. She always seemed to be distracted. I like the idea that the video shows kids that this is a normal everyday thing.While this video has not been the perfect tool for us, I would not discourage others from buying it. We have found our daughter prefers to read and that she enjoys reading the book ""Potty Time"" while sitting on her potty."	6
I ordered this on the 17th of April. It still hasn't arrived!!!!  Apparently, it takes OVER A WEEK to ship 1 item. Now I'm normally very patient with these things, but holy crap people. It's been 2 weeks!!!Other than that, I've used this product before. You'll need to oil or lubricate your firearm after using this but it does dry quickly and cleans well. Generally, I clean with oil, spray this stuff throughout and wipe down, then oil again. I'm fairly meticulous with cleaning my firearms though so you may not need to do this.	20
"Here is a great DVD for fans of The Doors!!! ""The Doors Collector's Edition"" conatins 3 awesome programs ""Dance On Fire"",""The Soft Parade"" and ""Live at The Hollywood Bowl""!!! Essential veiwing for Doors fans!!! Great extras too!!! Great picture and sound!!! Audio Commmentary by the surviving Doors members is also included on the three programs!!! Forget Oliver Stones film,THIS IS THE REAL DOORS!!! Classic stuff indeed!!! Two thumbs up!!! Five stars!!! A+"	6
I was using an Estwing Cats paw for a while but the steel it was made of was very soft. So i picked up one of these to see how it would do..it is leaps and bounds better than i expected. The steel is extremely hard so it can dig into the shaft of a nail and pull it right out. If i tried to do the same thing with the Estwing the nail would have dented the claw. Im extremely happy that i purchased this tool and would recommend it to anyone.	21
i have many utensils from this line, and just like the rest, this piece work beautifully. my only advise is don't wait for food to get stuck before washing, instead giving it a rinse as soon as your done with it, as food tends to stick really well to it, requiring a soak later. there is also a real nice looking stainless bucket for these to set on your counter top for around $20, and the bottom(oxo plastic) comes off for easy cleaning. i love my set!	13
Easy to use, intuitive controls, fast recharge, and durable. It's an indoor helicopter so it's small and by that, it would be a fair thing to assume its fragile. This is not the case, while I wouldn't recommend throwing, kicking, dropping, or stepping on it, I have had a few crash landings and it's taken them like a champ. The metal frame protects the working parts exceptionally well and the most fragile part of it, the blades, which are plastic, are replaceable. If you're looking for a place to start in the hobby of rc helicopters, this is it.	22
I think we bought this for $8. I was in the market for a snoogie but couldn't bring myself to pay $60 for a pillow I would only use for a few months. I am 7 months along and I didn't realize that I needed to 'lift' my belly a bit. Works great. A lot more sturdy than I thought. I'm glad it's not memory foam because I need a 'lift' not to sink in. I gave it 4 stars only because I have 2-3 more months to go in my pregnancy.A great buy! A great little size that does the job.	3
I needed a set of jumper cables for my new car and these had good reviews and were at a good price.  They have been used a few times already and do what they are supposed to - no complaints there.What I will say is that 12 feet really isn't an ideal length.  Sure, if you pull up front bumper to front bumper they are plenty long, but a lot of times you will be beside another car or can't get really close.  Because of this, I would recommend something a little longer than 12'.Great brand - get 16' version though.	2
"good enough to watch / have on in the background. Would be 10 billion times better without the Max Headroom idiot (Matthew George ""Matt"" Frewer) (what kind of idiot named Matthew needs Matt w/in quotes w/in his name, now if his name was Matthew George ""the Dork"" Frewer it would all make sense). The guy has the worst fake Australian accent ever & is horrible trying to be crocodile Dundee. Luckily the dum dum is only in about 5% of the scenes."	0
My wife and I said never again would we make almond pancakes, they were just to grainy and nothing like a regular pancake.  There was just something about the texture we couldn't handle.  Until I saw this product on Amazon and decided to give it a try.  It was like eating regular pancakes!! The texture was spot on to a regular pancake, the taste will always be different but we will keep making them with this flour and they will turn out great every time.  Highly recommend this product!!!	11
The only reason I am giving this 4 stars is because the product label is misleading.  It's just not for athlete's foot, it's also good for jock itch.  My derm told me that there's no difference between this powder and the one that's labeled &#34;jock itch&#34;.  It's deceiving because the prices are different, whether intentionally or not, it does not matter, consumers shouldn't have to deal with the confusion.  This product gets the job done quickly and easily.  I can't find a better medical powder out there.	12
The little chime sound you hear at the beginning is a kalimba, an african thumb piano. After being hypnotized by this you will then hear a very well played, quiet, fluttering violin (the sound of lark's tongues?)Don't turn  the volume up too loud here, because you will split your speakers when the  crescendo of acid guitars come wailing into your brain. This is music of a  sort you haven't heard, a classic example of acid rock, classical mixed  with rock, and some sophisticated noisy percussion and jazz thrown in. Hey,  relax, thats just the first track.	6
I love this bra and ordered a few of them because finding a bra that fits is like heaven. An uncomfortable bra is like ill-fitting shoes and makes me cranky. I had purchased this size/style in a store so I knew it would fit. In general, I think the cup might run a little small. The thing I like is that the padding is thick enough that no one can tell when you're &#34;cold&#34; when wearing a think t-shirt, yet I don't feel overstuffed.	8
I bought this because of all the great reviews in magazines and on t.v., naming this as the best mascara on the market.  I have never been allergic to a cosmetic but this product burned my eyes every time I used it and accidentally got a little bit inside the lid.  The brush is small (some may like that, some may not) and it is not the slightest bit clumpy (excellent) but the reaction I had to it outweighed the positives and I returned it and got my money back.	4
This is a puzzle game that can get pretty hectic pretty quick.It works well on my Kindle Fire and on my Droid 2.  I like the style of the game, and the sound effects are solid.  But what I like the most about the game is how hectic it can get.  Within a few levels, you are having to move at lightning speed and are trying to juggle a few different colors at once, and it can get pretty difficult.I enjoy playing it, and overall, I think it's a solid product.	1
My two best friends and I are all avid readers, although we usually read very different books. One of them got it, loved it and gave it to me, and this book was passed around for several months. We had a mother in law, an ex boyfriend all reading it, which really speaks to how good the book is.You can read the other reviews to find out what its about...I'm telling you, you will be hooked instantly. Clear your schedule. This isn't a book you want to start reading when its going to be a week before you can pick it up again.	5
My wife is from Brazil, so she is a foremost authority on pressure cookers as they use them there for almost every meal daily.Originally I tried the very cheap aluminum alternative for $15 on sale at Sears, and it failed after one use.This is better than the ones that last 20 years in Brazil. It's efficient, it's durable, it's just plain a good product, and you really shouldn't pay more for a pressure cooker than $40-$50 as it's a very simple item.	13
We like the taste of Caesar salad, and this one is a big hit.  When we are in a hurry and don't have time to make everything from scratch, it is convenient to make something tasty like Suddenly Caesar Salad.  Usually we add olive oil instead of vegetable oil.There's a suggestion on the box for creamy Caesar salad. It calls for mayonnaise and milk.Sometimes we add some romaine and chicken.  It's also good with crawfish tails, leftover broiled salmon, or shrimp.	11
I've had this beauty for nearly 2 months now and I truely love it.  The only disappointment so far has been battery life.  Mine generally requires a charege every 48 hours or so and I don't really talk on it that much.Why is this phone so great?  Simple.  It has it all.  This is the first phone I know of that has the large bright screen, infrared, bluetooth, USB connector and a speakerphone.If you are looking for an upgrade, this is definitely the phone for you.	7
While the updates have been slow and I do feel the app is WAY to heavy, it is somewhat better. I still spend time clicking the same song 10 times while shopping trying to review it only to have the song 5 tracks down start playing. As a loyal customer to Amazon I do want them to have great apps to support the music I buy from them. However this app in the past few months has cut my music shopping/exploring time in half. Simply put, this app is not up to Amazon standards IMO.	1
I have a hard time finding a bra in my size, it works fine around but the cups are usally too large and bag out as is the case here.  I know a good bra fit can be done because I've had bra's in the past that fit very well.  Somehow things are not being manufactured as they once were and this bra ended up as were others - in my donation bin.  Too bad really, wasted my money and am continuing to have no choice but to wear the old bra's.	8
I know it says that this is for older babies but my daughter loves looking at the blinking lights and listening to the music. A piece of advice: it took me a little while to figure out that you had to press the orchestra button a few times to change the song. Before I figured this out, the same song was driving me crazy! The only reason why I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 is because it does not have a volume control button. It is quite loud and I sometimes wish I can make it lower.	3
[One CD, with a running time of 44 minutes.] Ah...this wonderful CD shows off Enya's silky smooth voice. The eleven tunes are hauntingly beautiful. I won't try to categorize her music, it is simply too rich and complex.The paperwork includes the words to ten of the songs (The Memory of Trees is a musical number), and two nice color pictures of Enya. (I love extras!) So, if you like Enya's past hits, then I think that you will like this one as well. Buy it!	9
It is simply breathtaking, when it first came out it was so ahead of it's time some didn't beleve it could to what it was advertised to do. Unfortunetly it is becoming obsolete, but it was a fanaly worthy of Sega. The DreamCast came out before the N64, but it is almost as capible as the GC, and it rivals the PS2.There becomeing very hard to find, so if you own one of these, consider yourself lucky and hang onto it. In a hundred years it could be worth millions to some electronics antique shop&lt;laughs&gt;.	23
With the 8' version or the 4' version, plus the CH Hanson 45EX 4' x 4' Layout Triangle with 45 Degree Angle, there are few projects that can not be laid out and/or cut with great precision using a skil saw. The pro version is slightly more expensive, but it is built better so the additional cost is justified. These tools will save you the cost of a panel saw unless all you do is cut panels. Even then, you'll think twice before you shell out thousands for little more utility.	21
One of the nice features of the Palm V is its slim size.  If the manufacturer of this case would leave out the credit card/cash pockets, it would definitely be a plus.I have not had the accidental turn on  problems others have had, but I think when the case softens up a bit after  use this could be a serious issue.  I've got friends who switched over to  the hard case, which isn't as &quot;sumptuous,&quot; but fits well, will  not accidently push any of the buttons, and is a bit thinner.	10
This little gadget is perfect if you want to stand back from your mic stand just far enough to make it comfortable to play your guitar while you sing into the mic.  The usual solution is to get a boom to attach to your stand but this works and it's simpler, less expensive and takes up less space.  The pivot is controlled by a friction joint which you can adjust.  I wouldn't try to use it if I were a singing drummer, but for a guitarist, it's great.	16
"THANK GOD IT'S FRIDAY is a hokey little film that record labels Cassablanca and Motown put together to capitalize on the Saturday Night Fever craze that was happening in the late 1970s.  Like a cheezy ""Love Boat"" episode, there are multiple stock characters here such as the aspiring entertainer (Donna Summer), the womanizer (Jeff Goldbloom), the bickering married couple, the ""Good Girl"" (Debra Winger) and various singles looking for that ""special hookup"" while the disco beat thumps on and on and on.  Worth a look to catch disco styles of the late 70's and see Donna Summer sing the Oscar-winning song ""Last Dance."""	15
This was a great little addition to the series, I love having another look into Bella & Z's life as they deal with the struggles of becoming new parents. Given Z's past I thought that his reaction to being a new father was very realistic and the strain it put between him and Bella was heartbreaking. But watching him deal with his feelings and again fighting to overcome his past was great. His first interactions with Nalla brought tears to my eyes. This was a great short story and I would recommend to any fan of the series!	14
Ok so I do enjoy a Maya Banks book but found this one a little disappointing.This is a pretty standard romance storyline albeit with a m&eacute;nage twist- men don't know what they have, lose it, figure out they want what they lost, win the girl, everyone is happy.This book was enjoyable though I was a little disappointed with how fast our heroine gives in.  I skipped over most of the sex scenes because I was still annoyed about how fast she capitulated- though most were pretty steamy.This is definitely a good read, especially if you just want to switch off and relax.	14
I was skeptical of a book detailing life in a traveling circus.  But overall this was an entertaining and well written book.  There were a few things that didn't flow well or weren't really explained (or at least I didn't understand them) like why Jacob was so outraged at the gentleman who said he had worked at the circus or for what reason Marlena was throwing a suprise for her husband (that ended up going poorly).  But these uncertainties didn't stop me from enjoying the story.  Surprising twist.  Sweet ending.	5
This are the first recordings of the first real Misfits line-up (Glenn Danzig-vocal, Jerry Only-bass, Franche Coma-guitar and Mr.Jim-drums). All the material recorded in just few takes.Here you'll hear original Attitude, that is covered by Guns 'n' Roses (Spaghetti Incident LP) and Last Caress (which was covered by Metallica). Glenn's singin' is amazing.Whole album is included on Box Set, with exception of two songs: Spinal Remains and beautiful In The Doorway.	9
"If you've ever played the game ""Quiddler"" from the same makers of Five Crowns, you will understand the jist of the game.  This one, however, is using rummy techniques.The entire game is a challenge and scoring points is almost inevitable unless you are really lucky and are the one that goes out in the round.  The goal is to have the lowest score and so far, we enjoy it.It is not a quick game, so be prepared for 30-45 minutes of game time."	22
I decided to drastically cut my hair last summer.  It was to the middle of my back and I had it cut all the way up to around my chin.  After I realized that my old curling iron (1.25 inch) wasn't really giving me the curls I wanted I bought this one.  I hadn't really thought about the fact that a larger barrell would only produce waves.  My hair has since grown out to about shoulder length and this iron really does the trick.  It heats up quickly, gives me great curls that last all day and was an exceptional value.	4
Most Reliable biblical movie. The Gospel According to Matthew WORD-FOR-WORD is in the form of a movie. If a movie is not word-for-word it is not biblical. It is Hollywood, i.e. the Devil. Hollywood versus the Bible. You choose what you will feed your mind with. This is my favorite movie of all the &#34;biblical&#34; movies I have. Part 2 to Matthew is Acts, also by Visual Bible and also word-for-word. I give them out as gifts. They are less offensive to unbelievers and the religiously lazy who has never even read their Bible.	15
I do a lot of psychological testing every day and I have learned to solely use these red pens for taking notes, scoring test responses, etc.  They are precise, write very well and I can easily see the red when it comes time to dictate, etc.  I have been using them for years.The only setbacks for these pens are:1.  they cost a little more than they should for a plastic pen (I buy them by the dozen which saves a little)2.  All the people doing the testing want to keep the pen afterwards.	17
"After two applications I saw no improvement on my puppy. Then I found out online that it is ineffective if it's applied within 48 hours before and after the bathing. Shouldn't this information be on the box if it's so important? I called the manufacturer and was ""serviced"" by very argumentative representative. I don't think the product is worth the money at all. A friend of mine who used it also see no effect on her dog. You are better off buying from Hartz. At least their products are cheap and customer service is superb."	19
If you're used to Western saws, it might take you a while to get used to a pull saw. Usually, that's about five minutes!This saw has two cutting edges, one for ripping and one for cross-cutting, and it does both really well. It's light, extremely sharp, and makes short work of just about anything. I have a table saw, band saw, jig saw and circular saw, but unless I have to make many repetitive cuts this is the saw I use.You can pay a little more and get the same kind of saw with a fancy handle. Plastic works just fine for me.	21
"I needed a new car charger and for $5 and free shipping, why not try it. Very sleek charger. I've seen chargers that cost 3 times as much not looks this nice. I love the blue light that illuminates when it's plugged in. It takes the guesswork out for me, so I KNOW without a doubt my phone is charging. The length of the charger is more than sufficient. It fits all phones with micro SD connections.As I stated in my review title ""Buy it, you won't regret it!"""	7
"THE PHOTO IS NOT OF THE PRODUCT ADVERTISED!!! The charger is wonderful and is, in fact, a ""rapid charger"" (unlike some advertised as such that take 3 hours in the car to get your charge back. I run THREE of these at once for my Droid and my two Blackberries and they both charge fully in under an hour when drained completely! It IS OEM and not a ""fake"" or ""knock-off"". This is a real, quality, Motorola accessory and I highly recommend it!"	7
Confession: I am a long-time devotee to Burts Beeswax Lip Balm (also available on Amazon). When my lips are really dry, though, I reach for this. It sticks around if I put it on at bedtime, so my lips don't crack. I've never had a cold sore, but I sometimes will cut the corners of my mouth shaving; this keeps them from cracking, shortening healing time.There is no flavor to speak of, and no tingle. It's not as greasy as vaseline, not as waxy as most lip balms, and lasts for longer than any other I've found.	4
Wow!  Black gelcoat has a few scratches and little nicks from docking and the oxidizer made the fine scratches disappear.  The polish filled those little scratches to point of not being able to fine them.  The wax brought out the luster and made the whole process worth the effort.  Did the job by hand and it took about the same amount of time as a one step application of another brand.  Did not require as much elbow grease as anticipated.  Very satisfied with the product and will be purchasing their other detailing products as well.	20
"I've used Meguire's cleaner wax for over two decades. The protection and finish are great. What I really like about this wax is that it does not create a build up, as using other waxes like carnuba can do over time.Reading some of the other reviews is frightening! Please don't mistake the work ""cleaner"" to mean a substitute for actually washing your car!! The cleaner function removes previous wax and oxidants... but you need to carefully WASH your car before applying this, or any other polish or wax."	2
I I have a skunk that has taken up residence under my sidewalk. I tried replacing the soil and gravel that it was excavating. It just kept digging. I covered its entrance with bricks, it just pushed them aside.Then I found this Cridder Ridder, which seems like just what i needed. I pourted it all around the perimeter of the side walk.So the skunk is just working hard at coverpowering the spicey smell of the Critter Ridder with it's own scent...The strongest skunk odor I have ever experienced!This may work with deer, but apparently not skunks!	18
When my six year old entered T-Ball for the first time, I went out to get him one of my childhood favorites, the Wiffle ball and bat. Imagine my surprise when I saw on the package that this all-American toy is still made in the USA! I figured it to be good practice for his swinging and hitting. It brought back many great memories of my grandfather and I playing ball out in the yard. I hope my son has as much fun with his as I did with mine.	20
I've been using a One Spot to power a Gator small pedalboard for about 8 years now.  In that time I've done probably over 200 gigs and I've never had a problem.  Is it super quiet?  No, but when you have pedals and amps with gain and single coil pickups, there will be noise.  It's a fact of life.  I've never found it to be excessive.  Turn the volume on your guitar all the way down when you're not playing.I would recommend this to anyone looking for an affordable solution to powering their pedalboard.	16
Ordered this tool to align new headlamps I installed in my ranger. If you're looking at this review right now, you probably already know how difficult it is to access the headlamp adjusters. Thats where this little bundle of joy comes in, making it nearly effortless to align ford headlight assemblies. When you're not able (or willing) to use a small ratchet and metric socket to adjust the headlamps, than this is the tool for the job. And as always, Lisle makes an awesome product (which mostly tend to be made in the USA). Overall, great buy.	2
I bought this item for my wife for Christmas. I didn't know what to expect since this wasn't what she actually wanted. But I knew what she needed as she is a book worm and has magazines n books strayed everywhere. She also has no intent on getting rid of them no time soon. Needless to say it had to grow on her (she wasn't too thrilled at first). Now that thing is everywhere and I don't haveto live with magazines everywhere taking up space.  Afterward I bought an hd+. We've been more than happy with our decision.	10
This is a great app and it's FREE. Not only did it make finding a good wi-fi  connection for my Fire easy, but it also helped me improve my wireless signal for my pc. Easy to use and - Thanks to the developers for not shoving any BUY THIS - DO THAT at me. I understand the need to make some income from your work, that's only fair,. So if you need the cash so badly, please don't offer it for free.Easy to use and does just what it says.	1
I bought 2 of these, one to keep in my truck for road side emergencies and the other for automotive work use at home. The few times I have used them they work well, but just so you know they have a recommended expiration date on them. I think this is due to their intended use as a RV chock, where they would sit in the sun a lot and would degrade. But again they are cheap, and if the worries you, just buy a new one and toss out the suspect one!	20
This has become one of our family's favorite soups.  When the weather is cold we eat a lot of soup, so we have added this to our monthly subscription.  It is a good cheese flavor, mildly spicy, with some vegetables in it, and with nice chunks of white-meat chicken.  My kids are always glad to see it.  If you're not familiar with the Progresso brand you might want to know that it is not a condensed soup:  you don't add anything; it's heat-and-eat.  We use two cans to feed four people, with some bread and fruit on the side.	11
"This book definitely is number one on my list of favorite books (and I read A LOT).  The story is gripping, beautiful and a little sad in some parts.  It's one of those books that you start reading then constantly stop in the middle of whatever you're doing to read ""just one more chapter"".  The writer doesn't leave the reader hanging, wondering what happened to all of the characters but it's not a predictable ending.  Read this book, you will not regret it."	5
This is a fun game.  It has beautiful components, and I like how the game's individual quests are structured into an overall campaign, with weapons and abilities from previous quests factoring into future ones.  There is also a lot of opportunity to explore different strategies, and to engage in cooperative teamwork.  However, after completing a campaign, I have to conclude that many of the quests are unbalanced, with odds tilted heavily in favor of the overlord or heroes.  I hope that the expansion quests are better balanced.  If so, this game could be great.	22
"Mr. Simon's story ""Coachella Valley Traffic Jam""  is really the best.  The characters all come together great and the story is very interesting.  I lived in the Imperial Valley for years and reading these stories brings back good memories.  I can hardly wait for Mr. Simon's next book.  The extra minutia is gone and things move right along like you want in a mystery.  Keep writing Mr. Simon!!I know I'm not the reviewer that Mr. Rober Tollison is, he says it much better.  I'll keep trying."	14
I don't think I've met anybody that wasn't impressed by the Boresnake. It will totally change the way you clean your firearm. It brushes and wipes your barrel clean in a few quick easy motions. It may not be the best product if your firearm is filthy. You will probably have to get an old fashioned brush to scrub the gunk out. However, it does replace patches. One scrub with a Boresnake is equivalent to 5-6 old fashioned patches. This is great for maintenance cleaning. Get one. You won't be sorry.	20
"I saw fleas after having been using an oral medication for my dogs--it seemed to have STOPPED working..threw the kids in the tub...bathed them - then RAN to PetsMart and bought the Advantage....in less than 24 hours my dogs STOPPED scratching and slept the night.  I have ordered their next doses from Amazon...but at the first sign of the fleas I wanted IMMEDIATE action..LOLand per another reviewer I did in fact notice a whiff of ""altered"" breath on one of my (small) dogs---but it was't awful--but definitely ""changed"""	19
Great hot brush! My sister bought 1 of these years ago and then it died a few weeks ago. She looked everywhere and couldn't find one like it. I looked on Amazon and there it was! Needless to say I bought her 2 of them, 1 to take home and 1 to leave at my home. She was so surprised and both work perfectly. It's so nice to be able to find something like this at Amazon. If you use this size brush for curling this is a great little tool. Highly recommend it.	4
My only experience with the game is the solo aspect.  From a solo standpoint the game is probably the best shooter/crawler ever but to linear for me.  I like a more open, sandbox type game.  Half-Life took an already crounded genre, refined and did it better than anybody before or really since.  Flawless game play, easy and intuitive controls and top notch story line.  I think the story was the best part of the game.  Despite my personal views this really is a must have for any pc gamer as it really is the top game in its field.	23
This magnifier has nothing to cover it when not in use.I compared it with a Carson 3x magnifier and this one did not seem as clear as the Carson - hard to see the furigana clearly in Japanese comic books with this one.The Carson ones come with a cover.I would recommend the Carson 5x if you are looking for good size enlarging.Carson MiniBrite 5x Power Slide- Out MagnifierI wish I had skipped the 3x and gone with the 5x only.For this one in the 3x, the light works well and lights things up nicely.Carson MiniBrite 5x Power Slide- Out Magnifier	12
This cookbook is great.  I have really enjoyed reviewing all of the recipes.  Sure - some are more difficult than others, but there is a nice variety in this book.  For me it was totally worth it just to get the quick shell recipes alone.  We have only tried the chocolate so far, but it is so tasty.  A few of my favorite recipes in this book are the banana from the strawberry banana one, and the raspberry/blackberry ones (but I used mixed berries).  Also, it has great instructions for tips on using the Zoku.  Definitely recommended.	13
Back in the 1980's I bought a can of deoxit(not the right name but can't remember it) which worked much better and cost much less. It was made for the military. The spray has 3 levels but the low is still way to high. It does work but the stuff I used to have was much better. I don't see much else out there so I may have to stick with it.It is just very wasteful for the cost. I have had good luck with wd40 too, but it is very flammable. I would call it average.	16
I am not a student, but a professional adult with a bad habit.  I tend to write down important pieces of information, like telephone numbers, on any loose piece of paper I can find.  I know others who do it, so maybe you can relate.  This notebook cames with me everywhere so I know where the information is.  The perforated pages allow me to easily remove it and put it in the file it belongs in,  No more frantic search in the piles of paper on my desk!	17
After taking some time to find the right fit, (this is the hardest part)I now cannot wait to put these back on. The sound is crisp, I am a old time rock & roller, like my music good & loud. This headset does the trick.Take the time to adjust. I read a few of the reviews that said hard to fit. I disagree. Even in the instructions, they recommend adjusting to get the perfect fit. Believe me, you will know when you do.I would buy again.	7
Great concept. I love being able to access from the web and my kindle. I've used the app for about a week now.  I enjoy being able to track both my food and exercise. The database is huge. If l look close enough I have been able to either find a correct entry or build a recipe.I only give 4 stars because- foods are very clumsy and hard to manage- database is over populated with bad data- searches could be tuned to my usage- searches could be fuzzy to correct for different spellingsI recommend this app.	1
I had bought my first container of Dynasty Five Spices to smell. I love the aroma! Then I started using it in my marinated cucumbers 'n' onions. Well, it doesn't last forever that way. I tried another brand of five spices but it didn't even begin to compare to Dynasty. There isn't anywhere around close where I can buy it so I was glad to find it on Amazon. True, the shipping is a little steep but I pay more than the total for spices in stores. This was worth it!	11
Like Kleenex, Zippers and Google, this is a product that's so good at what it does we pretty much refer to ALL similar items by its name: Scotch tape.Unlike other brands, however, this is a strong tape with a nice, satin finish that disappears against matte wrapping papers.  You don't even have to rub it like crazy with the back of your fingernail to make it invisible, like some inferior brands. If you're using a shiny foil paper you'll want to stick with a tape that has a similar, shiny finish. (Pardon the pun.)	17
Really like these storage boxes, and for more than just long term storage.  I like to use them to sort items and then transport them.  For example, during the holidays, I  used these boxes to sort out gifts for different destinations.  The boxes are durable and easy to carry to the car, as well as keeping everything together once we've arrived at the destination.  This really kept me from loosing or forgetting any gifts or food items.And yes, I do use them for the normal paper folder storage.  They are so easy to assemble and break back down.	17
If you don't have any of these, buy this set, and buy it now.  Don't risk your fingers or health.I use the push block on the tablesaw and jointer.  The featherboard I use on the tablesaw, bandsaw and router table.  The  pushstick is used on the tablesaw and the router table.  These tools will  get used a lot.The only draw back is the push stick is not great for  thin material.  For thick material it works fine.  I like something more  like the Stots push stick for thin material.	21
I have used what I term as &#34;medium duty&#34; Bankers Boxes and a leading office supply company brand. Those are ideal for light and medium weight items. The biggest complaint I have about those is that when stacked, the lower boxes tend to &#34;collapse&#34; a bit. Well, I was surprised at the difference these heavy duty boxes make. They are not only heavy duty, but one can notice the &#34;thicker&#34; cardboard and the difference the extra strength makes. Worth the extra cost.	17
This is a great game of cards! But, instead of a regular deck of cards, there is an extra suit! Plus, as opposed to the majority of card games my family and I are used to anyhow, the point of the game is to get the LEAST amount of points... well, no points optimally! This is a great game for the entire family, for get togethers with friends, or even to play by oneself as there is a 'solitaire' way to play this game. EXCELLENT!	22
After a couple of times of using this, my scalp psoriasis has disappeared. I will continue using occasionally just to help with that.Update - This is working! I havent had any problems since I started using it. I use it 1-2 times a week now. I forgot to mention that it stinks... It does consist of coal tar so you can expect to smell like tar. I will use this and then a fragrant shampoo after to try to lessen the smell.I also have color treated hair and it has not caused any problems with that.	4
If my dogs like like the taste of Purina One and they eat it, then there is not more that I can say except I trust Purina products. I am always looking out for the best products at a reasonable price and through the years Purina products have provided food that is healthy and balanced, at a reasonable price, and most importantly, my animals like the taste. Most of our dogs and cats live to their teen years, with two of our cats living to 19 and 20 years old, this I think I it in part due to Purina products.	19
Essentially, this is the entry-level, 16-bit audio Creative Labs sound  card. It has a built-in mock '3D' stereo effect, a 128-voice MIDI  wavetable, and it can sample at up to 48khz in 16-bit stereo, and that's  about all there is to it. Whilst it doesn't do anything wrong in itself  (it's plug-and-play, so if you're using Windows it should work out of the  box), the Soundblaster Live isn't much more expensive, and offers  environmental audio.If you only dabble with music and don't play many  new games it's a perfectly adequate solution, however.	10
This product is excellent.  If you are the type who pays attention to detail, especially cleaning your dash, you will not be dissapointed.  For best results, follow the directions EXACTLY (this goes for all Mother's brand products).  I've noticed that using Mother's two step model: (1) evenly apply the product over the surface, wait, then (2) buff the surface to ensure an even application.  Using this product like one would for armor all will not give you the intended results.  Additionally, even a left-leaning Liberal (I am not either) would love this product as the ingredients are ph balanced.	2
I have owned my nook for two months now and am very happy with it.  My mom owns a Kindle, one sister a Nook Color, another sister a 1st Edition Nook...so I've seen my fair share of e-readers.  I did the research before I bought.  I actually bought my dad a Kindle 3G for Father's Day.  But the light weight of the Nook Touch was great for me.  I have problems with my hands and their abilities, so after a full day of commuting, typing, and writing, they've reached their peak.  It was the right choice for me.	10
I have had this Hitachi compressor for about 4 or 5 years, and I love it.  It is heavy duty, easy to find replacement parts for (ie filters, and I had a gauge face break).  Really puts out a lot of cfm per psi.  For a small compressor it is great, and much better than pancake compressors, or other small hot dog compressors I have used.  I really like how easy it is to drain the tanks... no threaded knob, just a lever.  Fills up with air quickly.  It is a big compressor in a little compressors' body.	21
cut the worms in pieces, crushed the runs and waited for repair, baited each hole.  Waited days and checked, worm gone in some, but no dead moles, and burrows continue to appear.  I have tried traps, poison peanuts, more traps, more traps, more traps.  These moles seem to live close to the house foundations and burrow into the grass sod to eat worms each year.  One came up and died on it's own last fall perhaps from &#34;old age&#34;.  Nothing seems to kill these critters, as long as we have earthworms and sandy soil and shade.	18
Another effective Avery office product that's relatively easy to use. Works fine with our home(Panasonic) and office(HP) laser printers (I didn't bother trying the labels with our ink-jet printers).  Avery provides FREE templates for Microsoft Word and also their own Design and Print Online.  It was easy to print out address labels for our clients.  Just make sure the printing is aligned properly with the labels.  The Pop-up Edge feature ensures effortles peeling of the labels.  There were no smudging.  Avery has kept it simple and useful.	17
What can be more fun than running around chasing monkeys? the are plenty of levels and gadgets to play with. The only downside is that the paddle boat is impossible to control in my opinion. Each monkey has its own charateristics and weapons. just trying to run up and snag the monkey doesn't always work. special gadgets must be used first. Pretty much run around the world getting rid of monkeys using gadgets. The game is pretty explanatory but is loads of platform fun. also includes minigames that can kill some time with friends.	23
This is a short story focused on Darth Maul's role in helping the Trade Federation gain a mining colony. It's not bad, but it's also nothing exceptional. It's fairly short so we don't really get to see any characters develop. The few events that do happen seem to go by quickly, including what should have been major battles. The story is included in the novelShadow Hunter (Star Wars: Darth Maul), which is worth reading, so don't bother to buy this one separately.	14
This was our second potty for my daughter as the first one was too difficult for her to sit on. We got it before 18 months and she is very small for her age, the other potty we had was &#34;the shortest on the market&#34; but bc of the design she had trouble. She had loved this potty since day 1 and she likes the little bear logo on the front. The only downfall ivories would be she can grab the basin and easily pull it out but she is pretty good about letting me do it. Like the gray color too.	3
Its steel.  Seems pretty strong.Limitations that you should be aware of:1) Heavy (x 2).2) you can't use this on a part of a roof with a ridge vent - it follows the contour of the roof - there is not space underneath to clear a ridge vent.3)  The edges are very sharp and it will dig into whatever roof material you have when you try to flip the ladder over after rolling it up the roof - you MUST rig up some padding.  I duct-taped on some left over pipe insulation.	21
Macy had these for $39.99 so I bought three.  All three failed within a very short period of time.Cuisinart charges $10 for warranty repair and you have to pay shipping to return them to Cuisinart, plus all the time required to copy your sales invoice, repackage the unit, deliver it to the post office and wait in that line all for the $17 difference in simply buying another unit.Then again, why bother buying another or even getting a warranty replacement since you'll be going through the same process a few months later.	13
I haven't used the product yet, but I'm sure it'll do its job relatively well when it comes to plugging up tread holes for a temporary fix. At the same time, it would probably be much better to just buy a tire plugging kit and have a little bit of know-how if you are physically capable. I bought this for my brother, who is a new driver and does not know how to replace a tire. It's in the trunk in case he ever blows a tire the &#34;right&#34; way.	2
Simply the best and quietest pumps I have ever used. It pushes a lot of air and works like a champ. Reliability is second to none with a great warranty to boot. Like all pumps the diaphrams will eventually wear out (though not for YEARS). These air pumps are made with some heavy duty diaphrams and replacment parts are everywhere on the internet. Replacment is simple enough. Buy it your fish and your ears will be happy you did. Smashes Renas, regular whispers, (especially)JW's, and all other pumps in it's class.	19
"I must confess I had to listen to the audio version of this because I'm not allowed to open my Kindle until Christmas.  Either way, this was the best book I've ""read"" in a very long time.  I think I could understand Jacobs feelings about being in the nursing home since I had to deal with my mom being in a nursing home.  His description about sitting in the dining room was so real.  Do yourself a favor and enjoy it.  Also, it has a great ending."	5
The regular version of these Pufs is way too rough, can't imagine using them on anything but elbows and heels. This extra gentle version is better for facial skin, exfoliates nicely. I use it with Neutrogena Facial Bar, rinse it well, and air dry it on end on a soap tray between uses. It does begin to pill slightly after a couple  months but lasts a good long time as long as you carefully rinse it and prop it up to dry out. This is the most cost effective exfoliating treatment available. Too bad its only available online.	4
This a solid performing unit at this price point.  I've been using this alongside my laptop for as long as I remember and it works the same as the day I bought it.  The two line instrument and microphone inputs make this perfect for a beginner or anyone needing a budget interface that works and is easy to use.My only negative criticism would be the plastic feels a little cheap.  But this is still a great USB interface for anyone who absolutely cannot spend any more than $60.	16
I used this to help bathe my mom who was sick in the hospital. She was in the final stages of lung cancer. She could barely walk, talk, or move. Just standing was difficult, so going to the bathroom to shower was out of the question. She stayed in the hospital for around 3 weeks. I just put this solution into a tub of water and gently wiped her body every other day. The smell was calming and not intense. It did not leave a residue or stickiness. I also bought the no rinse shampoo.	4
This game's great!  Some people are complaining that it's just about the same as the original, but how do you improve something that's perfect?  Plus, it's not just the same as Fallout 1, mainly because of its many, many  subplots that you can be involved in.  I think the subplots are even more  fun than the actual story!  You'll find yourself saying, &quot;To heck with  the stinking starving villagers.  I've got to become a Made Man for the  Wright Family!&quot; (or whatever your current situation is).  Regardless  of whether you played the last Fallout or not, it's a great game worth  buying.	23
I've been losing hair for some time and I'm pretty sure the reason is all the blow drying and product I use to &#34;protect&#34; my hair from the heat process.I found this towel on Amazon by accident and figured I have nothing to lose...but more hair...so I bought it.I had to re-dampen sections of my hair to apply mousse cause it was almost completely dry after having it wrapped for about 5 minutes.I can see this towel coming with me on all my vacations!	4
Guillermo Del Toro delivers again!The Orphanage or El Orfanto, whichever name you would like to call it, is excellent! It's a movie at its best! Great storyline, great characters, a little spookiness and alot of twist & turns that you will never see coming!The trailer for this movie, makes it out to much scarier than it is, but the movie will not disappoint.If you watch this movie and like/love it, watch Del Toro's other movies, they are all good- Pan's Labyrinth, The Devil's Backbone and Hellboy!	0
These boxes are easy to assemble except the protective pieces that fold into the carrying holes don't fold into holes well making them awkward to use. Most of the edges are protected except the two long ones on the lid which leave you vulnerable to cuts. They are a bit large. If you filled one with files of papers you'll have about the equivalent of about two boxes of printer paper. If you don't have to move them often that much weight might be ok. But they are sturdy and easy to put together.	17
I used to get nauseous every day, and couldn't figure out why. I would feel fatigued and get dizzy spells also. I had tried other multi-vitamins before, and couldn't tell any difference so I stopped taking vitamin supplements. Then I started taking this one, and I stopped getting nausous, and I find that I can think more clearly and have a more sustained energy throughout the day compared to days that I don't take it. I have been taking this for a couple of years now and I'm very satisfied.	12
I have suspicions that this  may be a counterfeit.  I purchased this because it was rated so high.  After washing and drying my face, my face starts to burn.  I then have to rush and put moisturizer on my face as quick as possible to avoid/eliminate the burning.  I have also noticed some dry patches on my face since beginning to use this.  Finally, my face burns during the day if I happened to sweat outside.All three of these experiences are new to me.  I have never experienced any of these things with any other cleanser.	4
This wand has been perfect for working all kinds of knots out.I purchased it with a Lutron Dimmer and it works great.  The dimmer does reduce the maximum intensity, but that isn't necessarily a bad thing.  If you need all the power just don't use the dimmer.  If you want a bit less intensity the dimmer provides perfect fine grained control, better than a massager with multiple settings.The only real negative is that the cord on this is very short.  An extension cord is required in practically any case.	12
I don't know what all these reviewers that talk about chipped teeth are talking about? The chipperd have flat top teeth and the outer blades have beveled. As for perfectly flat bottom dados - no dado set makes perfectly flat due to the fact that there is space between the chippers and blades and as for the kerf ticks in the corner again this is how they are designed all dado sets to this. Ugh some people!! This set is perfect for the hobbiest and weekend wood worker for the price you can't get much better.	21
Women's size 11 shoe size here (Men's 9 1/2) and I ordered the large.  Could not be happier!  I love the padding, and the comfort in terms of temperature and moisture.  I have a foot injury, and I need support and cushioning for my toes and the ball of my foot- these socks are perfect.  They are very thick- so make sure your shoes can accommodate them- but aside from that caveat, these should not give you any trouble, and at least for my shoe size, the fit was perfection.	8
I've been using this for about 10 yrs now. My hubby introduced me to the product, His hands were always so soft, even though he was a welder by trade and a rough and tough outdoorsman, too.A little goes a long way, and it has lasting results. No Petro!! Multiple uses! It smells great too- a clean, woodsy natural scent.Use for:Dry cracked hands/feetLip BalmRoseacea ( I put it on my rosey face patches before bed, instead of using a night cream, ladies)WindburnDry itchy skin anywhereCuticle BalmCuts/ScrapesBug BitesDiaper Rash	4
The children in our household are a little too young for this more complicated game.  They are 4 and 7.  Nevertheless, with the help of an adult they did enjoy it.  I think in a few years it will be perfect for them.  We remember this game from a long time ago but they have added a lot of complexity to it to make it more like real life.  And it really is quite good.  I think it would be better for old children.  It will certainly teach them a lot of real financial decisions.	22
I have been rebuilding my decks around my house as part of Ike recovery.  I have been reusing as much of the old wood as I could and the wood you get from lumber yards these days takes a of sorting.  With this tool, I was able to straighten as I went, saving a lot of time and return trips.  Took me a little while to figure out, but the hands off ability of this tool made it possible for me to do the entire deck without assistance.  Great time and money saver (I would think) for both pros and DIYers like me.	21
By mom has one of these stocked in her kitchen and figured I could use one. The hardest part about this product is finding the name &#34;lasagna turner&#34; vs. spatula. The best part about this device is the angle between where you hold it and the surface touching the pan. It makes it easy to flip eggs, turn lasagna, and I love it for cakes and brownies that are so hard to eek out of the pan. The metal is good quality, easy to wash, no complaints here!	13
This is a CLASSIC. Right up there with Cuban Linx. What GZA lacks in persona he more than makes up for with his wicked intelligent deliveries. He exudes a veteran aura, someone who has been there an done that. GZA cuts right to the chase and gets down in the thick of it in this album. It has a dark and gloomy aesthetic feel to it, which I love. Yo, do yourself a favor and stop reading my review and just buy this sh**t. It is just as good now as it was back in '95...You won't regret it ;)	9
"The cover of this book caught my eye and influenced me to read it.  Well, how does it go, ""don't judge a book by its cover."" This was an okay read. This chick was just dumb when it came down to Hustlers' and money.  Girlfriend thought she was slick, NOT!  She should have watched her back more and not fall for the Banana in the tail pipe.  Well, I guess I have to read book 2 to find out what happens.Scarlett (Don's & Diva Bookclub)"	14
I was having sporadic problems with my old floppy drive (also a Teac) so, suspecting the problem was with the drive itself, rather than the motherboard, controller, cable, driver, etc., I went ahead and bought this one from Amazon....  Well, it installed without a hitch, and now works flawlessly.  File transfers are somehow much, much faster -- faster than with my drive at work, and especially compared to my old drive.  Funny that floppy drives don't carry X speed ratings like CD-ROMS -- if they did this one might be an &quot;8X&quot;.	10
For some reason  I have a lot of trouble with the dry correction tape.  It breaks, or stops, or just won't cover well enough to over write.  It may be the type of paper they use in checkbooks, or just my bad mojo, but I ordered the liquid paper through the Vine program, and I've been using it; the same, reliable liquid paper that I used years ago, and it's still wonderful!I do recommend it for anyone.  Especially for anyone with bad mojo!!	17
These  picks  R awsome!  I have tremmors  in my  hands  and have a hard thime with pick control.....They Have a Gell  center,  Whitch  tingles,  It feels like muscles are activating in Your Hand  GREAT THERAPUTIC PICKI seem to do better with controll picks rather then ordinary picks.These  picks have a indentation so U know where put UR thumb and index fingerThey really Do what they say....If U have hand problems,  try these.....they really work.	16
Needed a knife for my cub scout and after looking at the cub scout version of the swiss army knife decided on this one instead. Much better value, probably because it doesn't have to have the scout logo upcharge on it. Wanted a knife without a corkscrew on it (why bother for an 8 year old!) and this one fit the bill. He is delighted and I liked it so much I bought a second for my girl scout. Versatile and excellent quality. Not as heavy-duty as my leatherman but a great choice for a pocketnife.	20
and I wasn't disappointed with this game.  I was hesitant at first because its a LCG and didn't want to spend a ton of money on expansions but found out there is quite a bit of content with this core game.  It comes with 4 corporation factions and 3 runner factions so theres a lot of replay avail and both sides are different so my wife and I switch it up to keep it fresh.  The theme is awesome and we both enjoy it.  I think eventually we'll get into the expansions but there is plenty here to play for a while.	22
I absolutely love this wallet.  I've had it for about 2-3 weeks and its durable and pretty.  It looks exactly like the picture, its got plenty of space.  The only thing I will mention is that in the cash parts, there is an opening, so you can't put loose pieces of paper or anything in there, because it might fall out.  Otherwise its great, there is enough space for a bunch of cards, cash and change.  The wallet can feel a little bulky when completely full but its great.	8
I bought this product to take camping with us this past summer because I thought it would be quick and easy and I wouldn't have to take along a bunch other things than normally go into my spaghetti. It was a big hit with the whole family and no one could believe it was Hamburger Helper. It isn't gourmet, but it serves its purpose. It is easy, tasty, and quick to fix. Just the thing when cooking is not tops on the agenda, but you still gotta feed the hungry horde.	11
Rick Just's Wizard Girl is a superbly written, young adult fantasy novel about a 11-year-old heroine named Kat. As Kat grows older she begins to doubt her father's fanciful tales of a magic land where dragons glide and wallacatoons whirl across the ground on three legs. Then a ribek appears, looking for a wizard. Wizard Girl is a highly enjoyable, unforgettable cascade through a world of enchantment and mystery, and a thoughtful sequel to the first novel in Rick Just's Wizards trilogy, Wizard Chase. Highly recommended for young fans of action/adventure fantasy.	14
Seems like every other week or so it randomly drops to 84 cents as an add on item. You simply cannot beat that price. I got several for my son and his friends to play with in the dirt and some for the front and back yard. It is a ridged plastic but dug fine in hard dirt for me. Don't go prying up rocks or it might break but for general digging it is just fine. But you can abuse it all you want and if it does break you are out less than $1.	18
Sometimes the words it gives you are creepier than playing on a ouija board. For instance: it said my dad's name. I haven't had contact with him in about 5 years. That night I see that he found me on Facebook and sent me a (20 days late) birthday message. I can't decide if I believe in the astronomical odds against that coincidence, or if there was something supernatural about it.If you don't believe in the ghost thing at all, I still say download it. You will probably have fun with it.	1
Just received it today from A1 Accessories.  I bought it solely to use on xbox live so I wouldn't have to keep moving my other headset that I use for work (I work at home).  My friends kept asking me to repeat myself.  One said that he had to turn down his tv volume so he could hear me (no lie).  I switched back to the other headset and I was back to crystal clarity.  After that, I threw this one in the trash.. Good thing it only cost me $5 or so.	7
This is as described but for some reason, I was still expecting it to be a little larger. I purchased it with the intention of using it when making my daughter's lunch - cutting cheese slices, sandwiches, cucumbers, etc.  It's the perfect size for what I wanted.  You could also use it as a form for making pancakes, etc but they would be very small!  I wouldn't use it as a cookie cutter but my family makes double the size of the average cookie.  Maybe for mini cookies this would work...	13
My dog loves them. I've stopped ordering them from Amazon though because my local pet store sells them for four-ninety nine and has an ongoing deal where if you buy three bags, you get the 4th free.. Check out your local pet store for better prices.These are great quality, safe treats. My dog eats the dry, limited ingredient diet food for small breeds. He's a pug with allergies and has never had a problem with these treats or the kibble.I recommend trying these with your pet. Get them from your local pet store for a much better price.	19
There are enough reviews here to keep you busy for a few hours, so I will only mention a few points:1) I had the Sportapros. They sound great, too (same drivers), but the Portapros are really worth the extra $13 or so bucks you'll spend on them. The PPs are much more robust, and look better IMHO. Just spend the extra cash, you won't be disappointed.2) No questions asked lifetime warranty.3) They sound FANTASTIC for most of us average joe's who love music, and tend to boost bass and treble on EQs.They are worth every penny!	10
So this app doesn't really replace having a real police scanner, but its definitely entertaining to listen to. I like the GPS settings that find the broadcasts around you, and the alert function is kinda cool, if a set amount of people tune into a police band it will alert you, theory is if 100 people are listening at once something exciting is probably going on.  The feeds this app use are actually available to listen to for free online, but it is a cool user interface for your smart phone.	1
The fit is good, the color is perfect, the quality is great,  but, the All-Star emblem is on the INSIDE ankle of each shoe. NO, they are NOT on the wrong feet. Dad, Mom, and grandparents checked for right shoe on the right foot. Yep! Both shoes were on the correct feet. This pair of Chuck Taylor All-Star Hi- Top Kelly Green Canvas Shoes are DIFFERENT, but we will definitely keep them and our granddaughter cannot wait to wear them to school to show her Hi Fashion Friends. Will we buy others? Absolutely!	8
My dog got this last year for christmas and its still around and intact, I was worried when after a few days of having it I noticed it had blood on it but he is an obsessive chewer and that soon stopped. Some people have complained about the heads or tails breaking off but mine is still intact. He loves this thing. The only issue I have with it is that now all the little spots on it are sharp and he likes to leave it right in my walking path. I can't help but think he does it on purpose.	19
This is a very beautiful, well-written story that at times had you really feeling - both good and bad feelings - for many of the characters. Jacob lived a hard life after his parents died but I appreciated his tenacity. He was determined to make it in the circus and to make it in life. I throughly enjoyed the ending and I think if I was Jacob that that's how I'd want to spend the rest of my days too. I highly recommend this book for anyone who wants to read a story about real life, struggles, love, loss, and hope.	5
Damn!  When the sax comes in at the climax (no pun intended)of &quot;Help Me Love&quot; you just have to take your lover in your arms and dance.  This is just one of so many brilliant moments to be found in the two sprawling discs of &quot;Black Moses.&quot;  Isaac Hayes' orchestrations and musical conceptions transcend any notion of the 1970s or &quot;soul music&quot; for that matter.  The much-sampled &quot;Ike's Rap&quot; movements deserve special mention as well.  You need this in your life.	9
The most used garden tool is the pruners.  Cutting your plants back, you should make a clean cut as to not stunt their growth.  Again as things like small branches and trees grow you have to prune them back so this tool works great.  I work HVAC and always have a branch up my butt and love these to cut back plants around the condenser.  Buy it you'll love them.  As what people said about rust, these are make of steel and they do get a little rust but nothing big.  Stainless is a soft metal and would not work.	18
The article arrived at the promised time, I didn't have any problems with the purchase, the watch is of good design, as shown by the images, please take into account that it is not a formal watch, it is ideal for camping or sports, it is a small box, if you have a very large doll might not like it, as it can be seen, as the brand is always faithful to his style and manufactures good quality watchescame in its original packaging, very well protected and all its functions to perfection	8
Works great - keeps all my fretboards looking great.  Even though I change strings frequently on my twelve (12) acoustic electric guitars this bottle will last forever.  I play hard for several hours almost every day and I'm always amazed at the &#34;crud&#34; that accumulates on the fretboards. (Guess I'll have to stop eating Cheetos while I'm playing - just kidding...) This oil breaks down the &#34;crud&#34; and restores the look of the fretboard to new condition.  No issues / no problems only positive things to say about the oil...	16
This series takes place a considerable time after the original series ended.  I liked that it was a continuation from the original series and not a complete re-do.  I liked most of the new characters and the continuation of Jean Marsh's character of Rose Buck from the original series.  I kind of wish more of the original characters could have made an appearance, but not sure how many of them are still with us.  Anyway, I thoroughly enjoyed this series and can't wait to watch the second series.	15
This headset was purchased to replace a Jabra BT8040.  The goal was to get a headset in which 1) people could hear me clearly and 2) I could hear them clearly.  After having this Plantronics headset for over a month, I am very pleased with the purchase so far.  With this headset, I have had no complaints that callers can't hear me or complaints of interference.  Also, I am able to hear the caller well.In researching buetooth headsets, I opted for this one based on the performance review and price point.	7
I use labels on a regular basis, be it in the office or at home.  My number one brand of choice is always Avery.  Now Avery has enhanced the labels by making them smudge proof and easy to peel.  When ever I have a big job and have to peel over 100 labels...you better believe I want a label that can peel easily and quickly and this product delivers just what I want.  Some may think a label is just a label, but not so.  If you want the best of the best, buy Avery.	17
Crash Bandicoot: Warped = Orange, cool, creative, fuzzy, neat, great graphics, awesome design, introduction of secret levels for the series, power-ups, new bosses (including a big boss), and a new playable character.  These things are what make this a major improvement on the two previous games.  Crash 1 was a breakthrough, Crash 2 opened up a new world, and this game completely blows it all away.  This was how I got hooked on Crash Bandicoot.  I played this and loved it.  I recommend it.	23
okay today i got this lube, and i am like lets give it a quick try, this thing dry so fast unbeleiveable, plus it makes ur skin so sticky, i added water worked for about 10 sec then dries again quick, so i am like lets stick with just the water lol.. but ya this product sucks, i ordered it just because it was high rated and i guess the only people who put it in high rated were the ones who owns the brand... so my $9.48 went right down to the trash...	12
My daughters (1 and 2.5 years) love this video - it's their favourite of all the Barney videos.  Lots of singing with relatively simple dance moves they can follow along with.  All the children in it look like they are having a good time and it's not just set in the tree house - a real farm with real animals is in it, a camping ground, a make-believe fairy book land and the school yard are all scenes for songs in this video.  If you like Barney songs you'll love this video.  Great value for money.	6
Gauntlet Legends is a mindless hack, slash, burn, and blast game. There is nothing wrong with aimlessly wandering about creepy dungeons, mashing buttons, and mowing down bad guys. It's especially fun with companions. This game is a classic. I enjoy the graphics, the audio effects, the characters, the different environments, and seemingly endless procession of monsters in this game. Finding all the switches one needs to progress is sometimes tiresome. The game's storyline is linear, but that's okay. Sometimes a formulaic approach is just what the doctor ordered!	23
I used to love Revlon's full n' soft mascara, so I decided to try this one.  Its just not the same.  If I'm not extreme careful my eyelashes become clumped.  My eyelashes are soft, but only because I used one coat.  If I put a coat this one and then use a different brush, my lashes look great, but I didn't want to have to use two brushes. Just not for me.  The good part is it washes off easily.	4
I bought this for my boyfriend, he loves it. I ended up taking a shine to it as well so now we use it all the time. Tea Tree oil is great for oily skin and this particular wash smells great. We use it as a face wash and have had less break outs since we started using it. Best thing about Jason products is that they are organic, all natural, not tested on animals and contain no animal ingredients. Perfect for vegans or those who just care about what they use on their skin and bodies.	4
I wear a size 10 1/2 in my running shoes (Go Fasters, USMC !), I ordered a size 10, and they fit perfect and are true to size,I also have wide (see photo), These are my third pair of Keens and the last two were a 1/2 size too big.So  once they broke in,  walking to the mailbox and back they fit like a well worn glove, or sock. LOL !!  Brad B.  (Winston-Salem, N.C.)	8
Castlevania: Symphony of the Night is one of the reasons I hold onto my Playstation 2 (as the Playstation 3, for some stupid reason, will not play older games).  I have passed this game several times, and every couple of years I feel the itch to revisit it.  This game is Castlevania at its finest--despite the terrible voice actors and mediocre graphics.  The bosses are tough, as are many of the areas of the castle, and figuring out how to progress in some places can be a challenge, but the rewards are great.  This game has endless replay value IMHO.	23
"Murder Mystery fans rejoice.A must see, must have film forthose who like murder mysteries,psychological thrillersand horror films.It is, in my opinion,Dario Argento's greatestfilm, and that is sayingsomething as he has mademany great films.I know there are many whowill disagree with that,but ""Tenebre"" can speak foritself.Amazing score.Great Images.Interesting Charactersand plot.Among the best murdersin movie history.Check it out.No spoilers.N.B.: definitely not for thosewho do not like graphic violenceand there is some nudity."	15
"This ""Deer Off"" deer, rabbit, and squirrel repellent works well to keep squirrels away from my shed. We don't keep much of a garden and don't mind the deer that come into our yard, but have a fairly serious issue with squirrels getting into my shed and eating our plastic gas cans (seriously annoying).This is a natural and non-toxic (to the animals) way to deter the critters without hurting them. We apply this around the outside and on the roof after each rain and it has kept our squirrel damage way down.Recommended!CFH"	18
"Nothing about this book appealed to me.  Not the subject matter, nor the title, nor the cover.  Pfttt.....nothing. A depression-era traveling circus?  What could be more....depressing?  My sister delivered into my hands one day and said, ""Read it.""  And I did.  I read it while cooking. I read it while eating.  I read it when I should have been sleeping.  I read and read and wanted to read more.  Now I hand it to you and say, ""Read it"".  You won't be sorry."	5
I've tried and returned at least 5 headsets ranging from $15 to $150. This one was typical of the others that I returned, low volume on the earpiece and low quality microphone. I finally ended up with a Panasonic TCA60 for about $19 which is very loud and sounds great on both ends. It's nothing fancy, no volume control and no mute, but who needs that when you can accomplish the same thing with your phone. Price does not determine sound quality. I recommend this product.	7
The lactaid product is wonderful for anyone that is lactose intolerant. The lactase supplement helps greatly. But go with the tablets. I bought a box of the chewables, and they are terrible. I take them now just because I paid for a box and want to get my money's worth. And once I finish this box, I will always go with the tabs. Granted, ther are more convenient in a place without water... but at the same time, when would you be eating without any liquid to take it down with? Stick to the tabs, you'll be happier.	12
I really wanted this to work.  It's a great design and it's easy to use and set up.  Sound quality listening is great.  Sound quality speaking, for others to hear, was unacceptable.  This could be because of the way it fits me, since this seems to work well for many others.  If you try this out, however, it's very important to check that others actually hear you well, and not, as in my experience, too loudly and with too much low end on the sound quality.  I'm returning it.	7
"I am going to see Jane Goodall's lecture next month, so I wanted to read a few of her most well-known titles before I saw her. ""In The Shadow of Man"" was the first book that I read in my Goodall Challenge. I loved this book. And I gained even more respect for Jane after reading this book. She's brilliant, she's a great writer, and she makes you really see chimpanzees as individuals who really are 99% of us.Read my full review (and join the Goodall Challenge!) here:[...]"	5
Kids love the characters, storyline, and the music. I, the adult, totally love the music!! I'm surprised the kids dance to the music because they are a pop/hip pop generation. The music is often jazzy, or blues its so cool. This is a really nice series, no hitting or bad words-important-toddlers reinact or copy everything. Certain shows I can't let them watch because they really model bad behavior, I don't have to worry about this with the Backyardigans. All the characters are equal, looks and gender are not an issue in this forward thinking show.	0
I love the way the knive feels and its durability is great.  As others pointed out, it's not perfect like fancier brands.  I bought mine in the late 1990's.  I worked as an EMT and needed a durbale knive to cut seatbelts and for other rescue purposes.I'm not a hunter, but I have taken this outdoors for hikes and fishing.  This is my second Gerber product.  I own the original multi-tool - Gerber's version of the Leatherman.  That got a lot of use.Bottom line: A great value to have in your collection.	20
I started these in the order they were written, not that it matters, just my choice.  Each one was better than the one before.  I don't like to divulge too much info as it spoils the read sometimes.  The brief descriptions give me enough to go on as to whether I want to read a book or not.  These were really page turners and just when you thought you knew, you were wrong...or were you.  I really enjoyed these and look forward to more.	14
In real life, Lee Marvin is a Marine that received a purple heart after being shot in the buttox during the battle for Saipan. Now here he is afterwards making movies where he is confronting his adversary and being the representative for the American side of the WWII GI psyche. His opposite is a Japanese soldier who equally does a splendid job to bring one up to speed with his culture. Both different and somehow the same. United together by a common goal of survival, yet on a hair trigger to let their warrior spirit flare. Interesting concept for a movie. Well done, appropriately cast.	15
I'm sure I'm a purist but I found the new board to be visually cluttered.  My son loves it, though, and it's a classic.  There is no doubt that this remains one of the most boring games for adults to play (I'll admit to slipping a double orange out of the pile to end my misery on occasion) but it does help the little ones learn how to take turns, increases familiarity with colors and teaches good sportsmanship (as long as he doesn't catch me cheating!!)	22
I was on the fence between this and a few others, but once I spoke with a couple real war veterans I was sold.  The blade arrived RAZOR sharp out of the box.  The grip is very comfortable and the weight is excellent.  It comes with a nylon sheath that works great, and has an extra pocket for a multi tool or possibly a magnesium striker.  The vet's I spoke with only retired their knives only after the grip wore out, which was after almost a decade of use.  Great Knife!	20
I have to say I am a fan of Jane Austin and have seen every movie ever made about one of her stories.  I am a hugh fan of this version of Emma.  I enjoyed the well acted story that wasn't to over done.  The landscape was beautiful and in keeping of the time period.  I was happy that there was never any lulls in the action.  I would recommend this anyone who wants to enjoy Jane Austin's story about a girl who tries to be a matchmaker and fails and as a result almost misses out on her own match.  Very enjoyable.	15
I love this thing!  It heats up in seconds yet its gentle to hair, it gives it shine and smooths the follicles, gives texture, bounce, and shape to lifeless hair.  This thing is the bomb.com!  I must have crawled under a rock because I have never seen this tool before and I sure wish I had!  It would saved me from one too many bad haircuts!  I love it and it came earlier than expected too! I was like a kid in Christmas opening up a special gift!	4
I purchased this Battery Tender to keep the battery in my summer car charged up in the off season.  Unfortunately this battery tender caused my battery to leak acid all over the trunk of my car causing corrosion and requiring an expensive repair.  I purchased this unit specifically because it's NOT supposed to overcharge a car battery.  What a mistake.  Don't buy this product - it doesn't work as advertised.  I reached out to the manufacturer via their website twice but they never responded to me.  Faulty product + no customer service = fail.	2
This is a refill package only and requires you have already purchased the Victor Flea Trap. Our experience with the flea trap has been very good and we have noticed the trap catches anything that happens to stray on its surface.The refills install easily and quickly. We have had to install a new bulb in the trap but that was also easily done. We leave the trap behind a sofa in the den and have noticed a steady decrease in trapped fleas as we've used it.This is a good supplement to flea control and can be safely used with pets.	18
"KRS seemed more focused than ever here. During the making of this album, Scott La Rock, DJ and Producer of BDP was shot and killed. During the making of ""My Philosophy"" in fact...which in my opinion is when Kris started showing his true colors. It was positive and negative, educational and entertaining..which had become the mantra of KRS ever since. On this album he tells you that Illegal Business controls America. He tells you how sometimes love is gonna get you. On this album you learn what the ""word"" ""Unrational"" means."	9
This app was cute/silly as a Halloween joke/toy, but I can't believe anyone would believe in what is 'says' or that anyone would pay for it [I got it as Amazon's Free App Of The Day]. Every few seconds it 'says' random words, and keeps a list of them, which you're supposed to believe are being said by ghosts/spirits. While I believe in ghosts, I don't believe in this app. It was fun for about 10-15 minutes before I uninstalled it.	1
OK this game was great.  The time line is very interesting in this game cause it takes place before and into the same time period of RE2.  The added feature of having the main boss chase you the entire game gives the game a interesting challege.  Just when you get all relaxed and are on a roll killing zombies, the music changes and your hear STARS!!!!!!!!!! So now you have a very ugly mean disgusting .....thing chasing from room to room.  Ne ways this game is great a definant must buy for any fan of the series.  And a great game for beginners.	23
The original Upstairs Downstairs was filled with characters you could care about, and it had all kinds of  true-to-life stories that involved the characters. The character development and acting was superb.However, the new version is a huge disappointment. The characters are shallow and don't make me care about them at all. Even Rose, the excellent parlor-maid in the original series, is a disappointment. Her acting is stiff and her character is just plain uninteresting. The same with the other actors..stiff and boring.After the second episode, I have no desire to see the rest!	15
This brand has never disappointed me, regardless of the diameter of the strings. To me they just sound complete. Even the light strings don't sound tinny, which amazed me compared to other big names. They complement my Washburns very well. Though they are not top of the line models, I often get compliments like &#34;you're guitars must be expensive judging from the sound alone&#34;. But it's been a trial & error for me. I found that my Washburns sound better with this brand at least as far as my own ears are concerned.	16
This is truely the best game for 64 becuase link is so cool. This is probabaly the best zelda game. Ganondorf is the man and you beat him in this game. If you havent played this game, i dont know but anyways in this one you could be big link and little link. Not like in majoros mask where you could only be little link. This game is way better than majoros mask. If you still have 64 (get a gamecube, so you can play windwaker)you need to get this great game.	23
If you leave spark plugs in an aluminum head for 100,000 miles, your spark plugs may break or the threads strip when you try to remove them.  Using anti-seize is supposed to prevent this.  If you use it, torque to the lower end of the tolerance because of the added lubrication from the anti-seize.  I never had spark plugs stuck even without anti-seize so I can't say for certain that it works but it is cheap insurance.  You can use it on any fasteners subject to corrosion.	2
This movie was great, my wife and I decided to go see it last Saturday night. Jesus was played by the young and attractive heart throb, James Caviezel. Jesus was taunted ruthlessly. Jesus was beaten mercilessly. Jesus was whipped until every inch of his body bled. Jesus was kicked, spit on, and humiliated. Finally he was crucified.Needless to say my wife and went home and I had the best sex of our life after later that night after the flick.The only thing I was disappointed with was that it wasn't Monica Bellucci who did the whipping.	15
I lost one of my two sets of nylon tipped locking tongs during a recent move and decided to try the steel-tipped tongs so that I could use them on the grill (I've used the nylon-tipped ones on the grill but I'm always worried about melting them). The tongs have long been one of my go-to kitchen items, especially for sauteing/pan frying various foods and for tossing pasta. The locking feature is wonderful for storage, and the little loop at the top is large enough that I can hang the tongs from the hooks on my kitchen workstation.	13
I like this app. I had very little trouble setting it up (had to try multiple user names). It has a huge database of food (although some of the counts are wrong so you do need to check against the package.). I'm able to add my own recipes which is nice since i make a lot of homemade items. It does sometimes require you to add the calories you burned exercising if it is not on their list of exercises. Overall I think this is a good app.	1
This goes on soooooo easily and absorbs quickly into my skin.  There is a very slight shimmer upon application.  NOT greasy at all!!!!  Since this product is fragrance-free, I've also used it in my hair, and it works as well as the Fekkai hair oil I use.  It's thin so it would be hard to overdo it like lotion.  The only thing is that when I'm in a rush, some oil droplets find their way to the floor or my counter.  Easy peasy to clean though.	4
This hose is just as described.  Very nice and light.  I connected it and in spite of having purchased some of those rubber rings to prevent leakage, I didn't need to use any except the one it has.  It does not leak at all, and is very easy to take around my patio to water my plants.  I was considering purchasing the &#34;new&#34; green ones that expand to double or more their size, but everybody reports having trouble with them and so I looked for an alternative.  This is it for me!  Light, but very nicely made.	18
There are a few things to know about the absorber to get the most out of them.  First, before using, soak in warm water, this makes it more absorbent.  Second, keep it clean.  The wort thing you could do is have a dirty chamois and drag it across your paint, this will introduce maring of your clear coat.  I wash it on gentle cycle with a little distilled vinegar then air dry.  When storing, get it as dry as possible.  Ive had them get moldy in the container from being too damp.	2
"My one apprehension with this charger was its size. It looked large in pictures, but the backlit clear window with the ""M"" logo looks so good, I don't mind the size. Best of all is that the charger provides nearly a full amp (measured >950mA on several occasions) of charge. Very fast charger at a great price!Update: MicroUSB port wore out after almost two years. I can jiggle it around and get it to charge every now and then, but for the most part it is finished."	7
I don't skimp when it comes to tape. I hate the cheap rolls that cause frustration. I spent a few cents more and get Scotch. It is less expensive in the long run. It doesn't rip or tear after a year or so on the shelf. A roll of Scotch High Performance Masking Tape 232 Tan, 36 mm x 55 m (Pack of 1) is around ten bucks, but I consider it well worth it for my use. This is the best masking tape I've ever used and recommend it.	17
"This was one of the best space saga's I've read in a very long time!  Red Mars had me hook line and sinker!  Green Mars continued that and I could not wait to get to Blue Mars to see how this was going to end.  I was very upset with Blue Mars though as this book had so much fluff, that I felt the author wrote stuff just for the purpose of filling pages.  That said, I would still recommend this trilogy though to any science fiction fan.  It's almost a ""must read"" in my opinion.  Well worth my time."	5
This is a continuous roll of very thin plastic, and one side of it is tacky (sticky).  The roll is housed in a hard plastic container, which has a serrated cutting device at one end.  What you do is pull on the strip of thin plastic, and when a sufficient amount has been exposed, you sever the plastic strip from the rest of the roll by using the aforementioned serrated cutting device.  I know it sounds confusing, but once you do it 3 or 4 times, you'll get the hang of it.  Truly remarkable new invention.	17
I loved this version of Our Lord Jesus!  I'm sure that Jesus must have smiled sometime :) This depiction may be a little too different for some to imagine, but I was surprised how fast I was able to adapt to his contagious smile which showed me joy at the message of the gospel.  Once again the visual bible series has done a remarkable job staying very close to scripture and staying clear of over dramatization which so often really destroys the story rather then making it better--you just can't beat the real story.  God bless those who made this wonderful movie.	15
OxoSpoonReview (#59191)The quality is superb, the kind that's a pleasure to own, BUT:Imo, it is too large for the average user, AND:The ergonomics are off-mark: used at normal height (stovetop) the angle of the bowl to the shaft is completely wrong.  But if you use it a mid-thigh or knee level, it's exactly right.Fortunately, the shaft is not so difficult to bend, so now the angle is right.  But it's still too big (for me), can't figure a way to fix that.	13
"Should had read the other reviews before ordering.Upon opening my package I found a filter cartridge set that did not even remotely resemble what I ordered or the ones in the picture. Instead I received ""Carbon/floss filter cartridges"" which are tube like and small. How does someone mix that up? I could have just picked up the filters at the store but now I need to repackage the item, go to the post office, and then to the store anyway (not going to order these here again). Bad service."	19
The only issue one might find with these is, as another reviewer mentioned, the warning regarding carcinogenic ingredients.  My guess is these probably have some amount of lead in them, under the paint.  I used to live in CA and the same warning was put on wine bottles for the foil used to enclose the ends.  I figure with these weights I'm not going to be touching them too often and I'll just wash my hands after each use.Otherwise, these are well made, clean and exactly what I wanted.  I'd order them again.	20
At first, the time-shifting and dual story line are a little confusing. What's going on here? Seems to be about two unrelated women whoo are finding love in the wrong places. Eventually, it all comes together, but not until the end. I didn't quite see it coming, either. I had to pause this a few times because I got bored and went off to do something else. It's not a very compelling story, despite the big-name cast. I did like the indie soundtrack which fit the lonely images of Mexico, southern California and Washington state very well.	0
Wow! Water for Elephants was recommended by a friend of mine. She loved the book so much, she bought it for me. I am happy she did!! This story was heartfelt, mind blowing, awesomely good!!!!!! Sara definitely has a masterpiece on her hands. Jacob and Marlena' s life, Rosie, all the crew, and other animals. What they went through and how they end up. I loved and cried. Camel and Walter, so sad. Water for Elephants is A must read!!!!!!!	5
You should pick up at least one of every expansion pack to this game.  They add new pilot and upgrade cards that are quite useful, in addition to another ship.  The model is perhaps the most detailed pre-painted model at this scale I've seen, and certainly the best value-for-money in that regard.The core of a Rebel Squadron is the X-Wing.  You get the best Rebel pilot in the game in this expansion pack, too.I also suggest you buy TWO of the starter sets, so that you get double dice, spare templates, extra cards, and 6 ships to start out with.	22
Others are more comprehensively detailed--A Night To Remember comes to mind--but this book, first printed in 1912, is what they had instead of People Magazine and Breaking News on CNN.  It's the fresh-off-the-press first stories of the passengers, the ship, the wreck.  It's one of the more human of accounts, and, paradoxically, one of the more informative as to the technical information available at the time.  A must-have curiousity for Titanic students.	14
The Eureka vacuum itself is amazing.  It is very powerful in such a small unit. It is surprised me at the first time when I used it. There is a small vent hole in conjunction of the handler. I accedentally put my left hand over the hole (I should xeal the hole first). The vacuum suck force made a bruise on my hand.The unit is very convinient (portable). I used it for the hard wood floor and on my Mini-Van. I do not need to buy another one for my mini-van.	13
It's a flange pedal, what else? For the price I was really happy with it. If I knew someone who was more skilled than me I'd get the workings inside a different case. The shape is cool, but I'd feel safer with it in a metal casing. The button is smaller than I thought, but it's not an issue at all; it's kinda easier to press!As for someone like me who is starting to get into pedals, for the price just to see how they work and if you want to invest in this realm, I would recommend this!	16
Nothing compares to being at a live JT performance. I have been going to James Taylor concerts for YEARS, and it's almost scary how his voice just gets better and better and more smooth. He never disappoints. His backup singers (especially the phenomenal Arnold McCuller) are the best, the band is wonderful.So if you've never been to one of JT's concerts, this cd gives you a taste, and believe me, you'll want more. If you have been, no matter if you've been 100 times, then you'll happily re-live the experience every time you watch this DVD.	6
I used this for a while. Though hollow plastic I felt it was designed to hold a camper from rolling and it did. One day I forgot to remove it when pulling out and it seems to take very little pressure moving forward to flatten it like a pan cake so I though my 50,000 investment may be better served with a heavy duty galvanized wheel chock that wont give in and even let me move over it by mistake and let me know its holding solid if I ever did again roll forward over it.	2
I purchased my Estwing 20 oz. Vinyl Grip Rip Claw Hammer from a certain Blue store recently. Although it costs more than other hammers, the Estwing is superior due to its simple one-piece design. During a long day of installing wood siding with this hammer recently, I appreciated its flawless weight distribution and rigidity. The grip is of excellent design and proves comfortable day after day on the job-site. After a redesign from previous generations (which I have occationally used), the new grip material is softer, thereby reducing vibration noticably over previous models.	21
Sound just like an Ibanez Tube Screamer to me. Many seem to complain about the plastic housing but, I'm fine with it. Seem durable and plastic has proven to be pretty strong in many products so... Sounds great but I also have a Berhinger Ultra Metal that I think kill for a high gain metal sound better than this. Note I use it with a Marshall JMC800 head, a Marshall JMP head and a Crate Blue Voodoo head and these pedal sound excellent. I've got some videos on YT if you search UM300, JMP800 and Blue Voodoo out.	16
I couldn't believe it when I saw it, but this app confirmed my worst nightmare- my wife is a ghost. I have always wondered why she could walk through walls or why she didn't have a reflection until now. It is a little strange being able to tell people that you are married to a ghost but once they meet her they see that she is an almost normal person. I haven't had the guts to tell my wife yet though, not sure how she is going to react. At least she isn't a zombie!	1
I personally own this game and can testify to how good it is. WWF attitude has eccellent character selection, and create a player mode....for its time. Unfortunately it is getting lost in the shadow of games like Smackdwon 2 with its quick executing of moves, unlike Attitude, and its enormous backstage area, unlike attitude. But on the good side it has some things other games don't, tag team Gauntlet and its huge hidden character selection that you are always trying to unlock. Great game, i would reccommend it to anyone who likes slowerpace games.	23
I thought the premise of the series was  ridiculous.  These rebels are criminal low lifes whose lives appear to be caught up in a Walter Mitty hero fantasy about being bad boy bikers.  The script throws in glimpses of male bonding, emotional depth, and odd paradoxical integrity, which comes off as absurd given that they're just a bunch of middle aged wannabes caught up in an arrested development of their teens.  If the storyline didn't attempt to be taken seriously, it could have been a good comic satire.	0
Other reviews have said that this product is difficult to cut, but I used a pair of ordinary scissors and didn't have any problem whatsoever. Also, the foam is a bit stretchy, so your measurements don't have to be exact. I cut the foam a bit short and then just stretched it to fit. While it's true that the tape won't last forever, it is also true that it won't leave a mark on your furniture once you want to remove it permanently. Simply apply more double-sided tape when the adhesive breaks down. Easy!	3
The original Japanese theatrical release is in pristine condition however Classic Media/Toho studios should have also cleaned up and remastered the American English dubbed version. That was annoying as one who would prefer to watch the American version and not have to concentrate on reading subtitles is distracted by the the uncleaned film print presented.The dvd also offers a couple of extra features which consist of stills of the monsters that star in the film and a biography(forgotten who).Stills include text and other film appearances of the monsters-with title and year given.	15
A very versatile tool! Amazing what a great idea! Thanks! Very handy anytime, I have given the 3D level 'a good going over' I can assure that it is very accurate, a very ingenious way to eliminate those long obnoxious levels.  (legal way to  have your cell phone on the job) tool!  Who would have thought to put a real time level in a cell phone? (in my case the construction company that I work for carries insurance on my cell phone because it is a work tool).Tea Kies CooperProvo, Utah	1
"Before I got photobucket, I was worried about losing my phone, b/c it has all my priceless pictures.  But now, it's okay - even though it's really not okay - if I lose my phone, b/c I won't have to worry about my pictures.  Every picture I take is automatically stored online through photobucket, and all i have to do is download the app again, on my new phone and ""Bada-boom...Bada-bing"" all my pics are back! :o) Great app!"	1
These are nice PWC dock lines or lines to just hang on to your Jetski (PWC). I have not had any problem with the Hook breaking yet but if it does I have SS hooks that I will use. This is a decent inexpensive line for a Jetski (PWC). I have a big 3 pass Seadoo and was easily able to attach the hook to the front bow eye. However, if you are worried about the hook breaking then probably best that you look for a dock line with a metal hook.	20
Once again,Patrick O'Brian bats a home run. The author manages to make day-to-day - in fact a minute to minute - life aboard a Napoleon-era man-of-war seem like it is happening contemporaneously. And a very exciting life it is too. Aubrey's skill as a mariner is amply displayed, as are the machinations of .Maturin. I used to think the C.S.Forester's Hornblower was the ultimate in sea stories of that era, but his skill has been supplanted, in my view, by O'Brien. If you like sea stories you will love this one.	5
If your thinking about getting this, becuase of the review rating, think again.  This stuff is terrible.  It did nothing but give me a stomach ache.  I'm not a huge health fanatic that knows all about the detox and clease process.  A year ago I took Yerba Prime and it worked really well.  I decided to try this one, becuase it was cheaper.  Well you definitely get what you pay for.  I do not recommend this product at all.  Horrible!!	12
As with all OXO Good Grips products, the handle on this peeler is great.  The blade, however, is less than 2 inches long, making it very difficult to peel rounded items like potatoes, though it does work well on long thin produce such as carrots or cucumbers.  Another problem is that the tip of the peeler is rounded and has a rubber coating, rather than the pointed corer found on most peelers.  In short, this peeler is a nonstarter if you are looking to peel potatoes.	13
Shipping was fast, got it within a week with Free Super Saving Shipping.  Says that it stops all stages of fleas, and kills and protects against chewing lice and ticks as well - I'm not sure about the chewing lice and ticks, but I did find fleas on my Lab puppy when I got him.  I use this on him, and within two weeks I didn't find any on him at all, not even after I bathe him and used a flea comb on him.  Says it works up to a month, and is water-proof.I'd highly recommend.	19
I often buy colored envelopes because I think they look so nice when you get them in a stack of mostly white mail. But if you want to use labels, the white rectangles look so ugly. These are perfect! I find they don't stick quite as well as the white ones, but never had one come off and get returned.They don't really help with dark colored paper (including most reds) because the black ink doesn't stand out enough), but for pastels or off whites, they are beautiful.	17
I've owned and used several sizes of these bowls for the past two years. The ergonomic design with the rubber grip makes these especially easy to use. I'm probably not supposed to stick them in the microwave, but I do, and this gives this set a distinct advantage over Oxo's stainless bowls. The bowls are also very easy to clean. Truth be told, they are just about as good as a mixing bowl can be unless you need something which also comes with a lid and can be used for refrigerator storage.	13
If you Want a decent scope that can stand the pounding it takes from a .308, then this is your scope. I previously bought a Barska scope that  shook to pieces after 12 shots.  After 3 hours of shooting, and more than 60 rounds, I shot my best pattern of the day at 100 yards, and I am not that great a shot ! The adjustments are not as smooth as a $4,000 scope, bit it is not a 4k scope, and bottom line is, it worked fine for me. Two thumbs up For Bushnell.	20
I love daft punk. Its so original. It was there at the beginning. This is an excellent album. Look at how many reviews it has. This album got around and its so popular. How can you not like it. Sure it has its flaws, but what album doesn't. ( If you find one that doesn't please email me - crome06@hotmail.com) Its such a great one to listen to no matter how old it is. If you don't have this album there is no reason you shouldn't, and i don't throw 5 stars around mildly.	9
"When I bought this item, I thought this was a really clever way to take a baby's temperature.  I use this thermometer only on occasion.  It's convenient, but it requires about 3 minutes before a final temperature is reached.  It requires that your baby keep it in his mouth for that long.  It's getting harder for my baby to accept this ""pacifier"", now that she is on the larger, 6-month-plus sized pacifiers.  Also, check with your doctor about how to take accurate readings: our pediatrician said that a rectal thermometer was the most accurate for the early weeks of her life."	3
If I could give it zero stars I would.  Not only was it HUGE.  The body would fit my three year old....but the legs would fit my 9 year old.  Plus we ordered a SUPERMAN costume.  This showed up without a cape and was a &#34;Super Hero&#34; suit.  The belt was made from felt and the the details were painted on with bad paint that peeled off, and were not even straight lines.  Bad form Amazon for letting this one slip by.	8
I must say this is the best shoe tree I've had. At a very good price point, this shoe tree does it job to maintain the shape of my leather shoe. The cedar fragrance leaves a pleasant hint of freshness in my shoe.Be sure to check the given shoe chart to make sure it fits your shoes well. I chose mine based on the chart and it does its job wonderfully. It fits snuggly; easy-on easy-off with the string loop to pull it out.I highly recommend this to keep your leather shoes up in shape.	8
"Keeping in mind the difference types of guitars and pickups, these D'Addario strings are good strings for all around use. They are suitable for rock, punk, country, and funk. Sure, you could spend more on ""boutique"" specialty strings to give you that exact ""vintage"" sound, but these strings are just fine whether you play in the bedroom, garage or club.I like the light guage .010's because they are easy on the fingers, but are still beefy sounding compared to thin sounding .009's and .008's."	16
These are conventional tab dividers. The paper is not as study as others I've used, but there is a reinforcing strip to -hopefully- keep the holes from breaking out. They are a generous number of paper tab inserts, are enough for many re-uses with new titles. There are no pockets on the paper parts, which are too lightweight to support that anyway. if the paper was sturdier I'd give them five stars, as is... I'd recommend them for lighter use applications. For that they are probably fine.	17
Nick Drake did not record a bad album during his all too brief life.  This is his darkest effort, the sound stripped down to mainly his own guitar, and quiet voice.  It is clearly a product of a great mental anguish, someone fighting their daemons, barely able to function.  The lyrics are less lush and hopeful than earlier efforts, the arrangements starker-- overall, a bleaker, surreal mood that matches the album cover.  The album showcases his guitar virtuosity drenched in melancholy and alienation.  It is impossible to listen to this album and not feel for this man.	9
If you want something to keep you warm that's not going to show bulk under your tightest sweater, this is what you want.  In fact it's so sheer, I can't even find mine.  I think it's hiding somewhere in the inner reaches of my washing machine or maybe clinging to one of my bed sheets.  Other than that, it's fine;  easy to wash and it dries (not in the dryer) in a very short time.  Now if I could just find it....	8
"This book contains a Monty Python and the Holy Grail reference on page 325 of the hardcover. That's about all you need to know about the ""quality"" of this entry into the series.If you want just a bit more, know that an entire plotline contained in the book (4 chapters or so) could have been excised and reinserted at the end in a couple of paragraphs.Marginally better than AFFC, but only because there's no Samwell Tarly. As hard as the characters try to get stuff accomplished, nothing really happens."	5
5 feet is a weird length for a cable. It really only has one use: When you're sitting right next to your practice amp. Just don't wander too far off! This cable is perfect for a kid who is going to his/her guitar lesson and has to plug in.I bought two of these for the home studio to jack in a guitar with a pedal or two in between. I feel chained to my workstation. Just my experience. Get a 10 foot and be free!Hope it helps.	16
"Pros: Extremely fast acting and long-lasting. One tablet does the job.Con: They have changed the mint taste. While I do think the new taste does leave more of a cool sensation [which is great], it is a little odd. However this isn't candy, so not knocking off a star. Just hope they don't ""new and improve"" a great product out of existence. Note: FYI, the ""new and improved"" bottles say ""NEW Taste!"" on the top, and the tablet color is a bluish-white."	12
When this movie starts flipping between the present, and two different times in the past (which itself takes time to figure out), it is hard to follow. At first. Once the characters and their places in time become a bit clearer, the story evolves into a complicated tale of a search for love, understanding and acceptance (both by/from others and one's self). I found the story to be one that drew me in, and even when the ultimate direction became clear, kept me engaged until the end.Great cast too!	0
When Starcraft came out there was no game like it, and still today there is no game like it. It is a lot of fun. I just wish they would do an HD remake of the 2D graphics. As the title states, this is my favorite game of all time.Why?1) Story is amazing. The campaign is challenging and fun. Also dark and rewarding.2) Units in all races are different and fun. Each race has cool strategies that are different than the others.3) Great online for the time. It's old now, but back when it came out it was awesome.4) Endless fun from online maps.Buy.	23
So much has already been said about this game. One of the best and most riveting games on the PSX. At the end of the castle there is a surprise waiting for you! I will not spoil it.The graphics are impressive, for it's time, as well as the animation and control. The music and sounds fit the subject very well.Definitely a game worth while getting and playing. Fun, orignal and not to be missed. A game to be passed down or willed to a family member :)	23
Great lube works amazing and makes everything a slipping slide. I use it for toys and will use it in a relationship when I get one... &#34;mind your business unless your trying to take me to the movies&#34; hahaha. But this lube is known for being your go to lubricant for toys and anal sex so if your new to lubes you may not need this big ass bottle but if your gonna be putting it on someone then you might. Other then that it's great to use love it.	12
The VMU has some cute features like mini games and it can be your watch so you know what time it is. It has other cool features. But i dont reccomend it because all it holds is 200 blocks of memory. Get the 4 slot 200 block each slot memory cards. It worked great for me. I just forgot what brand it was made by so youll have to look for it closely if you want it. The VMU is just kinda a waste of money. ONLY GET ONE OF EM DONT EVEN THINK OF GETTING 2!	23
I wanted to try this because it is organic. I feel like anything organic, is better than those synthetic stuff. I watched a few youtube videos and tried it on myself (underarms and brazilian) - and it does the job well!the directions state to microwave it first (but it gets toooo hot for me).. so i never microwaved mine anymore, and it works just fine.and I bought a box of tongue depressors here on amazon (really cheap for 500 in a box), and i find them to be a better applicator than the skinny sticks...	12
Just barely better than OK, and that only because the better version has yet to appear. These things fulfill a need, but I only tolerate it, not really like it. When it is filled, handle with care--neither of mine (I have two) has broken yet while being carried fully loaded, but I get the feeling that the wrong move would fracture the plastic.These file holders will have to do until...when? I don't know. At least they look better than the shoe boxes they replaced (yeah, I have big feet).	17
When I bought the Kindle version of this book on July 25, 2010, it came with the cover art. Now it's been replaced by a generic one. If you buy the printed version, you get the original cover art. The same should be true of the Kindle version. Apparently that is no longer the case. It may not be a big deal to most readers, but it is to me. I feel short-changed and Amazon hasn't helped at all when I approached them with this matter.	5
"This is pretty good..including all the great Simon and Garfunkel classics.  Hard to believe the recording was made 22 years ago. Where has the time gone?  Holy Cow!!It seemed like they rushed through a lot of the songs, apparently to keep the crowd energized.  The slow songs, like ""Bridge Over Troubled Water"" and ""April"" were the best. Art Garfunkel's vocals, what he adds to vocal harmony is what makes Simon and Garfunkel.  Sure Paul Simon is good, but I'm more of a Garfunkel fan.GOOD BLAST FROM THE PAST.  IN 1982, I WAS ONLY 22 YEARS OLD...YIKES."	6
I bought this play yard to put my 8 month old in when I need to keep her contained and safe while I am cooking. It is perfect. The size is ideal as she is able to roll and move around it and play with her toys but does not take up all of the room in our small living area. The pad seems comfy and she will be able to nap in it. The toys on the sides are great, she loves to play with the butterfly. I am very happy with this product.	3
I have to say that I have bought several kinds of visors on Amazon and these are my &#34;GO-TO&#34; visors.  Shipped quickly and arrives in good shape, looks great, can easily be kept behind my car seat for when I need it, it doesn't hurt my head AND most of all, the skinny sides don't ruin my short hairstyle when I take it off or put it on!  I'm on my 3rd one...they are really comfy and useful in the hot California sun and wind!  (o:	8
I disagree with the viewer from Cambrige Ontario. I found this version lovely! Samantha Morton was excellent (I need to see &quot;Emma&quot; now), reserved, thoughtful, just as Jane was in the book. Jane had high emotions  but did not strike out often...the childhood was a small part of the book,  and though important, it is not the major part of the story. The  relationship with Bessie and Helen and Mrs Reed are important as well. I  found this version to be just fine, and I am going to buy it!	15
ok I don't have this version of the Bible app. I have the you version but anyway I read the reviews and am totally shocked!! do some people really not know what the Bible is and think its fiction!!! I am totally blown away by this. God is very real and he is our savior he also gave us free will. so you are free to choose your path and what you believe. however he loves us all anyway and should you ever come to God he will welcome you with open arms. God bless	1
With a life of one day it is very difficult to rate a newspaper  - they are read for news and other items and serve an extremely practical purpose.  The New York Times has a good reputation and that stands  and whilst in the USA it is a good daily read with interesting articles, news items etc.  If it wasn't up to standard, it would fade away very quickly so &#34;reviewing it&#34; is a little unnecessary.  Enjoy the paper, read it for leisure and information and be thankful you don't live in a nation without such information readily available and virtually free.	14
I'm 28 weeks pregnant, and have been having trouble sleeping with the extra tummy weight so I thought this would help.  However, this didn't really help me sleep better at all, if anything it made it worse.  It was very uncomfortable.  Maybe I'll try it again later when my tummy gets even bigger.***UPDATE***  Now that I am 33 weeks, I use this support pillow every night.  Once my tummy got bigger, the pillow was no longer uncomfortable and actually helps support my belly very much.  Now I can't sleep without it!	3
Unlike the Diaper Genie, the Diaper Champ can be used for both disposable and cloth diapers. We have two of them since we mostly use cloth, but occasionally need to use a disposable. It's great, and very easy to use, but you do have to empty it a couple of times a week or you will get a little stink from all the rotting diapers. It's so easy to use, my 18 mo old daughter figured out how to flip it and started doing it for fun. She's now 2.5 and still loves to flip her training pants into the pail.	3
This book is my 6 month old's favorite touch and feel book.  Each page shows a picture of baby feet touching some kind of textured surface on the left side and then a huge touch and feel piece of that material on the right.  I have never seen a touch and feel book with such large areas to touch.  It is really wonderful!  Also, the textures on each page a pretty different in feel and color so each page really feels like a new texture.  My only complaint is that the book is not longer!  We are always sad when it is over!	22
"Easy to use, easy to install and it has so many different options of installation (extensions, y-spindles, stairway adaptors) and all were easy to figure out. Even my 60 plus mother said it was easy to figure out how to use it without any instruction. Really liked how the bottom ""supports"" that press against the wall were flat on the bottom edge so they lay against the floor better. My other brand of gate didnt have that. Only complaint was my box had no directions in it. But managed without them."	3
Awesome Cover for a gorgeous phone. I have a HTC one in Blue and needed a good cover while actually showing off the blue beauty. This cover does it all. I kind of wished it to be clear on the back too rather than the frosting ( which make a good design ) because my blue HTC still somewhat hides in it. Other than that, for the price, it's got a great grip, and a sturdy feeling. I love Boxwave for all its extraordinary accessories. You can never go wrong with this purchase!	7
The story has a lot of potential, one that made me immediately go searching for the series to consider purchasing.  I wanted the cliff hanger to be solved, but the series that follows does nothing for it.  Worse, the author hopes that we will be drawn to the series enough to pay over $9 for it.  The problem I have with this is the book was good, but not that good.  I worry that I will be let down if I were to spend that much.	14
"The Swingline Standard Stapler, ""Eco Version"" is as a very cheap stapler that works well. It is very lightweight, and is mostly recycled plastic. It claims that it can staple 15 pages with Swingline S.F. 4 staples, but don't expect more than a couple of pages with standard staples. It also claims to have ""Antimicrobial Protection which repels bacteria and fights off bad odors, fungus, and mildew."" Does it? I don't know, but it can't hurt. If you're looking for a cheap stapler for light duty use, for $5 you can't go wrong with the the Swingline Standard Stapler, ""Eco Version""."	17
"I have very dark brown hair and for some reason it took me a while to learn that these feria blacks are just not good for your hair. not only does it strip my color out of my hair (my hair starts turning medium brown in spots after a week of this product) but my hair absolutely feels awful (course, dry, brittle) immediately after usage. loreals ""last through 28 shampoos"" creme gloss product is longer lasting than this so called permanent hair color. I think this crap needs to be taken off the shelves and they need to try again."	4
"Compared with the same size Avery labels of different spec, you pay more than twice for this easy-peel feature per label.Avery Easy Peel White Mailing Labels for Laser Printers, 1 x 2-5/8 Inches, Box of 3000 Labels (5160). The easy-peel feature is simply a strip-away of remaining pieces on the paper. It then offers you "" Pop-up Edge for fast peeling"". I don't think it is worth the extra charge at all. Go get the basic one. You will be very happy with it."	17
Well, what can I say? Based on the customer reviews, this purchase seemed like a no-brainer. However, after only 4 months of light use (used on my rig at home) it is toast. The cable barely holds a signal now (constantly need to jiggle the thing to work). And before you ask, &#34;is it perhaps your output jack?&#34;, all of my other cables work with my gee-tar. So it is definitely the cable :(Anyway, I gave it 2 stars because while it WAS working it sounded great through my Roland JC120.	16
I got this shampoo hoping that it would help my dried out winter hair. Well, it made it worse! I looked like Broomhilda afterwards; it stripped my hair of anything that it had left and I looked as if I'd stuck my finger in an electrical socket wet. I don't recommend it at all if you have dry hair. If your hair is oily, then I think this would be fine. It sure smells nice and clean though! Save your money for a professional brand - they definitely overshot the marketing on these!	4
This has been a lifesaver!!! It can sterilize 5 small bottles & nipples 5 minutes at a time!!! Just add the correct amount of water, pop it in the microwave, and go!!! It's saved me so much time and hassle... At first, I didn't think that I wanted to spend the money on a sterilizer when I thought I could boil them myself for free, but this has more than paid for itself in it's first 3 weeks of use... A definate must have for new moms!!!	3
If I could bathe in this stuff, I probably would. I've used dozens of car shampoos over the last 20 years or so, and this Meguiar's Gold Class is definitely the best. It doesn't take much to get a nice cleansing foam going, and once you do, it applies and washes with an ultimate smoothness that I haven't been able to find with other soaps. And not that it matters, but it's also got a really great scent, which is a nice little bonus when you'd rather be doing other things besides washing your car.	2
"I ordered the ""Brown"" color (not the ""Carhartt Brown"" or ""Dark Brown"") and I wasn't sure what I'd receive because the color swatch for Brown on the product page looks more like a moss green.  The Brown I received can be described as a rust color, a shade of orange-brown.  It's nice, just wanted to share the info on what the color actually looks like.  The pants are the sturdiest I've ever owned, my wife was laughing because it kept its body shape when I took it off and placed it on the ground."	8
"Who could ever forget ""BABAKAZOO""????? This is by far, the best disco film ever! Terri Nunn from the rock group Berlin is in it, Debra Winger, Jeff Goldblum as the smarmy club owner, Donna Summer trying to get her big break, and so many other great colorful characters. When I first got HBO back in the 80's, this movie was one of the one's being shown. I must have watched it 200 times. I have been dying for it to come out on DVD. If you remember the disco days, or even if you don't, this is a hoot!!"	15
A lactation consultant recommended these bottles to me. I bought one to make sure my baby liked it before buying more. I didn't want to hassle with the disposable liners. I feel my baby doesn't swallow as much air. A lot of babies are gassy and I wouldn't blame it on the bottle.  I also like the idea of the different sized nipples to adjust the flow.  I have only used size 1 because we need her to slow down; she eats to fast and gets a tummy ache.These bottles also fit perfectly in my bottle warmer (the first years) excellent choice!	3
my only issue is that you can't put this lock on and put it in a gun case smaller than 3 inches high.  There is a 1 inch nub in the back of the lock.  I use this in place of the cable lock which I hate using because you have to keep the action open and the slide springs are compressed.  If someone sits for a couple days straight, they can probably figure out your combo with only 3 numbers, but it's better than nothing and you don't have to worry about losing a key.	20
"I bought this used at a baby tag sale, so keep that in mind when reading my review.  The dolphins are much bigger than it seems in the picture, each ring is 4"" or so across.  The dolphins fascinate my daughter (1 year) and she does enjoy the toy, but they barely make any noise (keep in mind it is used) and the rings will not stay attached to one another.  Instead we just have the 8 dolphins floating around the tub.  I think its well worth the $2 I paid, but I would not pay the retail price on this toy!"	22
The 13th season lacked a lot of the good biting satire and social commentary of previous seasons. The pee humor was rather disgusting as I prefer intellectual humor. To that end, the last episode made the whole season a worthwhile purchase ($15.00 Walmart, which had seasons 1-13 to my surprise). In Dances with Smurfs, Cartman, plays a Glenn Beck character doing the morning announcements (the kid who was doing the announcements was killed in a case of mistaken identity.) Cartman hounds Wendy, the school president, and blames her for every wrong at the school.	0
WARNING !!!!!  they don't even make there own food it is licensed out to another company if you look on the back of the bag it doesn't even list who it is made by it only says guaranteed by canidae and when i asked who it was made by i was1 either completely ignored2 given a huge run around only thing i ever got was a state it was made in they wouldn't even tell me the companythis is dangerous because this is how all the pet food recalls happened a few years ago by out sourcing manufacturing	19
This product gets used 20-40 minutes per day on average. I also use it around the house as a portable radio so it gets 1-3 hrs of use maybe once every other week.  They say the battery life is 80 hrs, but that must be if you use it 80 straight hours.  We received the radio in early March, put in 3 batteries, and they are still going strong (it is now December).  Amazing.  Sometimes I am shocked when I find a consumer electronic product that works well, works simply, and works reliably.  This is one of those products.	10
"I received this as a gift and was surprised at how quickly this warms bottles.  However, if you don't pay attention, it will overheat the bottle.  It would really be helpful if there was a timer or auto shut-off because the water can become scalding.  I usually use the wide-neck bottles so I don't have the ""floating"" problem but the few times I did use the slim regular bottles and did experience the floating bottle.  The upside is that it does accommodate the wide neck bottles.  It's also an easy-to-clean item."	3
I know. . I'm reviewing the product here - its terrific! Costs nearly $5 in stores here and worth every penny from Amazon.My only gripe is that it took forever for these to arrive and when they did they were pretty battered and many of the cookies inside the box are broken up. I love having my kids eat these instead of Oreo's etc but they don't seem to go for broken cookies. Go figure.Anyway, the cookies are great, Love Paul Newman but if you aren't prepared for some broken ginger o's you're better off picking them up in a store	11
I've already have this product and ordered it in January. I decided to come online and write about how well its working and I plan to order more soon! I am a dark skinned african american women and have had discoloration on my face for years until I began to use this product. I only use this product, suncreen, along with carbolic soap and have seen a DRASTIC improvement. I was scared this would burn my skin or make me itch because I suffer from eczema and tend to have sensitive skin but no problems whatsoever! :)	4
I've played this game before on the Android and the iPad. It is a fun, spacial puzzle game that has always challenged and entertained me. I hesitant to pick this up but then decided to give it a shot. I **LOVE** the graphics. I've never seen one look this good. The cars take on a more 3D tone than the other games I've tried.If you like this type of puzzle game, or are looking for a puzzle game to play, then you might want to try this one out.	1
I simply adore this movie! It is completely Biblically accurate, using a word for word translation from the Bible yet so highly entertaining. This is the Jesus I think of when I think of Christ. The actor does such a splendid job at portraying what I believe the true Christ would have been like. I've never seen a Jesus on screen better than this.The Visual Bible was a very appropriate name for this portrayal of the book of Matthew. It IS the Bible made alive visually. Don't miss this movie. Buy it NOW.	15
For years I had bottles and other narrow-mouth containers that needed cleaning. I would always find some way to cram a sponge or blast hot soapy water in there. I knew bottle brushes existed, but for some reason I just never got one. Somehow it came to mind to buy one on Amazon. This one is definitely a winner. It doesn't scratch like the cheap little ones my mom has. The long bristles and slightly flexible wand mean it can really clean just about anything very thoroughly. Just don't accidentally mix it up with a toilet bowl brush.	12
It is a mystery how such a thin towel can absorb so much water. I know it is the waffle weave that allows the towel to guzzle up so much water... but I can dry a section of my SUV and wring out the towel and then dry another section without having to wait.This towel is a tad expensive and there are other waffle weave towels available, but this makes the drying process for my vehicle take much less time. I simply use the water sheeting technique and this Supreme Guzzler. No blower or anything else!	2
I gave the Craig Kennedy collection four stars, catering to those who like forensic investigations when the science was in its infancy. Actually, I liked the Thorndyke stories better. His cases are more believable, better written, and the characters are developed better. I read all of the books in this volume and enjoyed my time. Still, the procedures are a bit tedious since as a rule they are pretty familiar to most readers. Forensic science has progressed so much more, but if you like this period of history, you will enjoy Thorndyke. --Dr. William H. Stephens, retired editor	14
This is the third review of an irish album I write today (the others were Cranberries) and now I'm sure about that Ireland is one of the countries producing the best music in the world. And not just commercial pop-music in the Spice Girls way. Okay, I just wanted to say something about Irish  music. Now let's say something about this album. It's great. it's  beautiful. Very good, easy listened music. If you like Enya or you just  want some easy-listened relaxing music. This is the album for you to buy!	9
Once again, I failed to check Amazon before purchasing this...it was over $20 at Advanced Auto. It is $11 n here as I write this.I have a 2012 FJ Cruiser and it was running a little roughish...and I am super sensitive to any changes in my vehicle. I've put 30k miles on in one year...so it isn't really new anymore. One bottle of this has cleared up whatever was ailing my truck. The dealer couldn't find any issues. I think it was dirty fuel or injectors...this works.	2
Bought this because my shower was getting cluttered with different kind of soap, shampoo, face wash and etc. After receiving this and putting it up on my shower wall, no more bottles!Pros:Each bottle holds a lot of liquid.Each to use buttons.Clean design.Comes with waterproof adhesive and it's stick as hell.Durable - I've dropped the bottles over and over again when I was clumsily trying to shampoo inside and it still works.Cons:The adhesive stinks when you first place it on but that's a given and does not take away rating for this product.	4
Swanson rules when it comes to the speed square. I have this products big brother the 12'' model also and cant imagine life without one.These things are bomb proof. In an everyday carpentry kind of way this tool will last forever.It's an aluminum calculator you can use as a saw guide.on any given day you can walk up to a job site and see these squares hard at work and you know if the industry has adopted it you can rest assured it has proven itself over and over again.Now get out there and square something up.	21
I bought this to polish chrome wheels.  The PowerBall Mini is a huge letdown.  The foam started disintegrating almost immediately when run across any angle of the wheels surface.  The foam is simply too weak, it rips and shreds.  I would only use this on very smooth surfaces that have no angles to them, ridges, bumps, etc.  But if you're polishing something that simple in shape - you don't need this in the first place.  Grab a rag and you'll be done a lot faster.	2
At least they are tight on me.  I have a 38&#34; waist, so ordered the 36-38&#34; Large size.  They fit, but are very tight.  Next time I'll order XL.  Other than that, I love the Kangaroo pouch style.  For years I've worn Munsingwear's Kangaroo pouch briefs, but reviews on their latest product have not been good now that they're made in China, so I was happy to find Jockey making this style brief.  I'm very happy with the quality... just should have ordered the larger size....	8
After reading all of the reviews, most of the other cases seemed a lot sketchier to me (reviews were very mixed).  I figured it was worth the extra few dollars to get a great one that I knew would work well (this was getting great reviews).  I didn't want to have to deal with trying to return a cheap $3 charger to some random company and risk that it would put my Droid on the fritz.  The extra few bucks was great for peace of mind.  It works perfectly and charges pretty fast.  No issues and love it!	7
This show has a lot of potential, and fulfills some of it.It achieves a level of gritty believability due to the gravitas of the main stars. There's a lot of &#34;Oh, I love that actor!&#34; moments, and the cast is culled from Tier 1 and 2 stars from other tv shows that you'll be delighted to get to visit with again.Coherent story, believable drama, a fun sci fi series.If you're not into SciFi, I don't think you'll like The Event.If you're into SciFi, you might appreciate the several-levels-bump-up from writing acting and directing from shows like Stargate.	0
I love this guitar strap button. It's a great alternative to the invasive buttons that have to be screwed in. I actually purchased it for my newMahalo U-35PK Sparkling Soprano Ukulele Outfit in Pink. It works well for it's stated purpose and appears to be of high quality. The leather is nice and soft and the button fits snuggly into the leather hole. Check out my user name stinkylungs on Youtube to see a video I made of me installing it on my new uke if you want to see it up close.	16
I most definitely do not agree with Dr. Ben Carson's politics, but I most definitely admire his skill. It's not a particularly great movie, but still worth watching. Actually, I purchased it because I really like Cuba Gooding Jr. and I was not disappointed in his portrayal of Dr. Carson. The rest of the casting is excellent, too. I can't say I love the movie because some of it goes a little slow for me, but there is always fast-forward! If you like biographical-type movies like this then, by all means, purchase this DVD.	15
I didn't know what to expect when I ordered this jar of pommery Mustard and was surprised when I tried it to see the consistency of the spread.  It looks like a mustard that hasn't been ground up[ completely.  Okay, if I had read up about it I probably would have known that the name tells it all.  There are always consequences for your actions, sometime good and sometimes bad.  This time I was lucky, this mustard is great on a sandwich.  I love the stone jar.'	11
I used to play this album back in 1976 all the time, and thankfully, still have it on vinyl, and, without a lot of scratches.  I do wish I had it in C.D. form, but, for what people here are asking for it, no thanks, I'll just use my turn table!!!  This is one of Diana's very best albums of the 70's,  Get this is you can, you will so enjoy hearing Diana's classic 70's voice again.	9
My wife and I rated this a four-star series. The makers of the series quickly roped you into the story line, and the actors were believable. There was a sufficient amount of action with an appropriate combination of heroes and villains. We got hooked on the series and spent a good portion of one weekend enjoying it. We finished the entire 20+ episode series in just a few days. Our only disappointment was there was only one full season and a very-abbreviated second season. That being said, we found this series to be very much worth the watch.	0
This a necessary item. I hated to have to cover my coffee table and have my house look baby proof(I even avoided it for a while) but after two big bumps i bought this item.Its easy to install and I like that I could cut it to the size i needed. It came with the corners which is great. The tape it uses is perfect because it really stays put. My baby has tried to pull at it and it doesn't come off.This color is light enough that doesn't call too much attention in my living room.	3
I love the size and sturdiness of it! Gives kids more play room than the average playpen. It also holds up well to our large baby playing wildly in it. She loves the various objects on the sides and the different noises and such they have to offer. We haven't traveled with it so can't comment on the transportability. The pad that comes with is not waterproof and even with a thick quilted cover under the sheet tinkle still leaks through to the pad so I suggest getting a plastic cover for under the sheet. Overall a great buy!	3
This simple calculator seems to work fine, as advertized.  I docked it a star because I wasn't able to find a function for integrations or higher order functional analysis, but I suppose you can't have everything in a five dollar calculator.It also lacks voice control, has little or no artificial intelligence, and in general makes a very poor companion if you're stuck alone with it on a desert island.  It does break the ice at parties with the classic 58008 joke, but only the most sophisticated of users are able to appreciate the humor.	17
I bought this novel for my Nana long before it was made into a movie - she loved it and raved about it to everyone. I felt very proud to have picked a good book for her. A few years later I read it myself and I fell in love. This book is delicious and a real treat. You will fall in love with every character and you will not want the circus to end.Even if you have watched the movie - you should read the book - it is (as always) so much more than the movie.	5
&quot;George Lucas in Love&quot; is the funniest eight minute short movie that I have ever seen.  What if George Lucas, the creator of the &quot;Star Wars&quot; movies, had a muse, like &quot;Shakespeare in Love&quot; suggests that the Bard did?  Well, imagine George Lucas living in a dorm at USC, struggling to create a short picture.  And then the fun begins.  This short is laden with layer after layer of inside jokes.  I've watched it over a dozen times, and each time I see another joke that I missed before.	15
Excellent, Smead file folders - letter size, 1/3 cut tab, 100 per box: what a great product!  A standard, reinforced tab folder: plenty of room for writing info on the tab (and it's thick and reinforced - very nice)...these are highly recommended for filing, carrying papers, etc.  There are certain office products that you get used to, and then never want to do without again, and for me, good, solid 1/3 cut tab file folders are one of those products: always handy to have around, always can find a hundred uses for them...would definitely recommend a box of these!	17
The rubber knife is a rubber knife... the only bad part is that the &#34;silver&#34; rubs off really easily... an hour after taking the knife out of the packaging I saw that the knife had rubbed a bunch of silver paint on my pant leg; it wasn't a big deal, but now the fake knife looks like a black rubber knife instead of a fake knife... oh well, it was cheap and fun.  maybe a can of spray paint will bring back the &#34;silver look&#34;	20
I bought a few of these for my family.  I think I still prefer the rally over this model since it gets rid of the scissors and adds a screwdriver instead.  Still, there is a reason why this is a &#34;classic&#34;!  You won't be disappointed with this small keychain knife.  I would suggest adding an extra keyring so the knife sits flush with your keys.  The one keyring it comes with will cause the knife to sit perpendicular to your keys, adding bulk.	20
This is an excellent roll of masking tape. It is wider than some, is stretchier than many, and has a nice, tacky stickiness to it that peels easily and leaves no gooey residue. This will work excellently for any of my masking needs, though its extra cost will only be of benefit for baking applications, such as is done in automotive paint shops and the like; it is rated to withstand temperatures of up to two hundred and fifty degrees Fahrenheit. This is a high-quality, specialty masking tape.	17
"What could be better than Hemmingway?  More Hemmingway.I learned about this short epilogue on the program ""Hemmingway in Cuba"" was broadcast April 6, 2013 on my local pbs station.  There is a joint effort by Cuban and American scholars to preserve all the materials left at his home in Cuba.  I am not a scholar, but want to share this with other readers of Hemmingway.This Epilogue for ""For Whom the Bell Tolls"" was found in the basement of Finca Vigia.EpilogueIt was night when Golz rode in a staff car on the road down from the pass to El Escorial."	5
You want a battery that is going to last, then you can't go wrong with this one. I bought the 8 count because my garbage can needs 4 and the shelf life of these batteries is so good that I have no doubt it will provide me with the many months of use. Since I have the first 4 still being used, going on 7 months now, I am going to guess at least 1 year before I will need to replace so yes, a good purchase price for this 8 pack.	12
It's not just THIS Walden Farms product, but every one I've tried. Syrups, marshmallow dip, Ketchup, Cocktail sauce.....!! You'd think after wasting so much money on them (not to mention the taste that leaves your mouth feeling like a chemical sewer!) I'd learn but kept hoping ONE item would be salvageable. No. They are so bad I almost considered gargling with bleach to erase the taste. There are no words for what these Walden products taste like: not any that can be printed on Amazon, at any rate. (shudder)	11
My son uses this program online when we are home and on the kindle when we are away and have internet. He uses the app on my Droid phone when we do not have internet. It is a terrific app listing items by product name.  Many items are listed, and others can be put in equivalent items. It sets up your goal calories. Exercise can be listed and the amount of calories from it are subtracted from food claories taken in. It is the best weight loss assistant I have ever seen.	1
it's a bit more expensive that the OEM cabin filter, but the charcoal activated one seems to do a better job at keeping those exhaust fumes from entering the cabin. You know that situation- you have you AC or heat on fresh air, you're stuck in traffic, and soon enough, you smell the car exhaust from around you.  Since putting this filter in though, i have not noticed any smell of fumes, so while it's new at least, it does a great job of keeping your cabin air nice and clean.	2
I use this Critter Ridder to keep animals away from my koi pond and veggie garden.  This item works much better than fox urine at keeping pests away.  I had a problem with animals eating my koi.  I did find that it has not kept stray cats away; however, I have not lost one koi since I started using Critter Ridder.  I was losing at least one fish a month before using the product. Fox urine alone wasn't keeping the pests away.  I recommend this product and I will use it again.	18
Written in the first person perspective, this story explains the life of an circus worker back in the old days, before any regulations were ever thought of.Rough and rugged lives wherein the guy with all the power hasn't much thought or care to the value of life - be it animal or human - but Karma wins in the end!Well written, kept my attention enough to loose sleep so I could keep reading it.As always, the book is better than the movie.  Read the book first and you will most likely understand the movie better.	5
Elixir strings are very nice.  so slick and last forever compared to standard strings..But i will admit D addario strings are just as good but have to be replaced more often. So if you have the money and want to try these technology advanced strings i dont think you will be disappointed. Some people say they are too slick.. and i can see that when you put new strings on you expect them to feel a certain way..  But you will get over that once you see how long they last.	16
The opening on this is too narrow to accommodate iPhone/iPod/MacBook adapters.  If the cover were taller, it wouldn't be an issue because the whole adapter could fit inside, but it's not.  It's just too short, even for the smallest of the Apple adapters.  So I had to return this anyway, but if I'd kept it, I would only have wanted to use it for a power strip that I never need to add/remove plugs on -- the tabs to open the cover are a serious pain...and ironically would be easier to open if my hands were smaller.	3
Peter Pan is an uplifting fantasy. It portrays the desire of children to fly, have a magical friend, and travel to a world of adventure. Its a simple story with moral lessons. The biggest aftereffect is that it stimulates a child's imagination.Disney brings to life the classic children's story. After watching the movie all the way through I turned on the audio commentary by Roy Disney while watching it a second time. The background information on the film is fascinating and gives you an entirely different perspective. Walt Disney and those who provided the voices also have interesting things to say.	6
I've seen other reviews of people who had problems hooking this to their bikes or that it fit too loosely.  Frankly, I have no idea what they're talking about.  One strap velcros this to the grip on the handlebar.  You have to modify your hand position for the extra girth to the grip but it really isn't a big deal.  I have another one of these that you install inside the handlebar by hacking off the end of the bike grip.Both work, but this one took about ten seconds to install.	20
When I was a little bitty kid back in the day (around the late 80s and the early 90s) I loved this movie so much. Everyday I came home from kindergarten I watched this in the late afternoon. I used to sit on the living room carpet, back against the couch and sing &quot;Somewhere Outthere&quot; over and over and over again. The movie was just good to me. I adored it. If I have kids, I would show them this movie because it's touching and it's universal. Recommended.	6
My daughter and two granddaughters received this for Christmas.  There ages are 10, 6, and 4.  The little ones need some help from their mom but it was a great experience anyway.  My 10 year old is hiding the book until she gets it published; to surprise us with her life story..  The kids of all ages really enjoyed it.  High quality, will purchase it again.  Can't comment on the publishing stage as we are still in the &#34;writing the book&#34; phase.	22
This game has some of the best graphics that I've seen for the PSX.  It levels are very colorful and filled with futurous scenery.  The many powerups and weapons add to the fun in this game.  Control is a little hard when you first start playing, but it is easy to get used to (The craft slide a bit when you are turning).  There are only 8 ships to choose from and some of them aren't very good.  More tracks wouldn't hurt either.  This game is a good game and you should buy it.	23
While this can opener is commendable for how smoothly and easily it works, it does not cut through the last millimeter or two of the can top. This means you have to twist the top off, which leaves a tiny but very sharp protrusion. Given the usual high quality of OXO products, when I first bought this, I was sure I'd picked up a dud.  OXO replaced it quickly and with no fuss, but the second opener has exactly the same flaw. Now I see I'm not the only one to complain about this.	13
I recently bought a Ruger LCR 357 and replaced the Hoag grips with Crimson Trace grips.I have seen several reviews where people have had trouble using the 36-A with the LCR. While the loader is a little tight, I've been using them to compete without an issue; it just takes a bit of practice. After about 500 rounds you get used to it and it's a non-issue and definitely better than using strips or manual loading.The only thing better would be moon clips for the LCR but so far no one makes them.	20
I needed to remove my security screen to install a space filler on the bottom. I didn't see any way to do this alone till I seen an instruction video using these to mount the door. I never could have done the job alone without these.  I then used them on a bathroom door that had split.  I took the door down, squeezed in Gorilla Glue and used the clamps to press the crack closed for a couple hours. I love these clamps and I see lots of use in my future home improvement and honey do projects.	21
"When Tex Avery departed Warner's ""Termite Terrace"" for Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer in 1942, the animator's wild imagination was given free reign - bolstered by the studio's high production values. This out-of-print video includes eight Avery gems for a glorious hour of cartoon madness. ""Who Killed Who?"" (1943), ""Lucky Ducky"" (1948), ""Bad Luck Blackie"" (1949) and the influential ""Magical Maestro"" (1952) represent Tex at the peak of his frenzied powers. Though Avery's entire MGM work was released on laserdisc in 1993, it remains criminally unavailable on DVD."	6
it scared the living daylight's out of.me when blue dots appeared dissapeared appeared. I am superstitious.  and I'm afraid of this kind of stuff. but if u r like me get it and b wit a friend when u do this. DONT B ALONE OR ULL BE LIKE ME!!! I fell off my bed and ran into the living room, looked at my mom looked at me and went back to bed. I immedialy turned off my kindle and fell asleep. I had a dream of a ghost! AHHHHHHH!!!!!!!! but I liv it.	1
I LOVE this pen. I actually used it when I had gone out to eat and signed my receipt - I liked it so much that I wrote down what brand it was and then bought my own. I like a gel pen but I don't want it to write too thinly or too thickly (where it's almost &#34;wet&#34; afterwards), and this pen is perfect. I almost hate to be this excited about a pen, but I am. I just wish it didn't cost so much, or that it was sold a bit cheaper in a multi-pack.	17
I sprinkled this on my cats  food to help their appetite, entice them to eat more. It's supposed to taste like cheese. Cats are supposed to love it. They didn't. I read where some people use it in place of cheese. I tasted it. Whoa.....no wonder the cats didn't want it. I donated it to a neighbor who used it. She loved it. Go figure. I guess we're all born with different taste buds. Mine say no to nutritional yeast! Your buds may care to differ!	11
"As I writer, I am often sending out short story manuscripts to potential markets. I'm a great recycler of envelopes, but I spend far too much time trying to peel and/or scrape off the old labels while trying not to tear into the envelopes. These thick labels (they call it ""TrueBlock Technology"") will go right on top of the old labels and cover them up completely. Works like a charm! They're big enough for long addresses or large fonts, and you can even create logo shipping labels with them."	17
This is in-your-face metal that don't let up - Zeppelin reincarnated for the 80's.  David Coverdale is a modern day Robert Plant, I just wish he was still around these days.  Whatever happened to him, anyway?Whitesnake jammed cuz they created good love ballads AND they made throbbing, groove-heavy metal hits, like the awesome &quot;Still of da Night&quot;.  Trust me, metal fans, you'll love each of these 9 songs.  If you get the chance, be sure to see an 80's Whitesnake video.  It's like Led Zeppelin re-formed and came back to do some heavy entertaining - with a great lookin' chick!!CHECK 'EM OUT!!	9
this is excellent tablet, excellent touch screen response and button controls. When you hold it in your hand, you will feel that its built tough and can withstand rough handling(my 17m old tosses it sometimes out of excitement and its still holding good). Battery is also good, last about 8+ hours; the old drawback is that there are very limited apps on Noon web, but I heard there's a way to sideload adds from Amazon that I haven't tried yet. But yes, I would highly recommend it.	10
As someone that bakes a LOT, for my own family and others, Saf has been a dependable yeast.If you use yeast, it is absolutely throwing money out of the window to buy the small packets.I've used yeast that has been frozen for over 3 years, and it is still active.I portion it into glass jars and always have a few in the freezer and one in the fridge.It lasts far beyond the expiration date  when frozen.For each packet of yeast called for in a recipe, use  2 1/4  teaspoons.	11
I always get the smallest and finest bubbles from the disks.  I've bought this a few times now, for different parts of my tank.  The downside is that they are less versatile than the long block air stones.  I find putting these in corners is nice, but also if you put this in the middle of the tank, put driftwood over it.  The bubbles will roll on the underside of the driftwood and float up in less of a circle.  Gives you more options in terms of tank placement.	19
"I never like leaving a bad review because I know this book is the creation of someone who worked very hard to write it.  However, it really lacked anything truly new.  I guess the concept of how a werewolf is ""activated"" is a bit novel, but the plot and simplicity of the story prevented me from giving it a higher rating.  It was very short and everything magically ""all worked out in the end"" with little development of the characters.  I am sorry to say that I do not plan to read anymore more books in this series."	14
My old Workmate worked easily.  This new Workmate being top of the line, WM425, should be at least as good. It is crap. The top is cheap, thin  material, not even cut to square. I could replace the top but the vise is flimsy and so poorly designed and manufactured that I have to crank it with both hands. I took it to a B&D Service Center to ask if I can substitute a top from an old Workmate. They young man there had never seen a Workmate and had no idea what it is for. Do not buy.	21
I use this for my Ruger 10/22 rifle, 22 inch barrel, my Ar-15's ( Colt and M&P Sport-15, 5.56) and my SR22 pistol. Com'on, it's a no brainer to clean with these snakes. It takes up to 30 seconds to scrub, clean and polish/ wipe dry your barrels. get rid of the cleaning rods. I am a consumer, not a dealer.  I have purchased 5 different caliber sizes including a 12 gauge shotgun. when you get it, you will no doubt see the huge advantage of having them.	20
Packaging says that the mouse pad is 50% pre-consumer recycled content, and that the packaging card is 100% post-consumer recycled material.Seems like a decent mouse pad and it'll fit my needs. I have knocked off one star because the pad is black and my other black Fellows mouse pads have-- over time-- become dirty with oil and dusk from hands and fingers. You therefore need to wash them frequently. I don't mean to slight a product because of it's color, but this pad should be available in grey or dark grey.	17
These labels looked as if they would be perfect for my Christmas packages and I was correct. I like to save boxes in which I have received shipments for later use to send birthday and Christmas gifts through the mail, but often they have markings and barcodes on them. In the past I have just used a heavy black marker to blot out these things. This is a much better alternative. The labels are sturdy, took printer ink well, and are opaque so that nothing can be seen through them. I like any product that helps me to recycle.	17
I bought this album mainly for GANGSTA'S PARADISE.  I've never been a huge Coolio fan, but I liked the song.  There were a couple of other good songs on the album, especially the one with the guest appearance by WC (the  Shadiest!).  The lyrics and the beats on that were pretty tight.  The rest  of the album was enjoyable, but nothing outstanding.  The lyrics were  nothing special and the production was mediocre...he needed more work from  Crazy Toones.This album isn't a must have unless you're a Coolio fan,  but it's enjoyable.	9
"This is an update to a review I placed here 5 years ago. These blades are still a good bargain but I just learned that they cannot be re-sharpened. I sent them to Burn's Tool sharpening service and they responded that the blades were ""disposable, and will not sharpen nicely"". BUT it took me 5 years to dull 1 1/2 sets of knives (3 edges), so I am not terribly disappointed. If anyone knows somewhere that will sharpen these knives, (at a cost less that just buying new ones), please leave comment here."	21
I purchased my Bruan shaver with clean system about 8 years ago.  I use to be able to go to Walmart and purchase the refills, but here lately Walmart has not had them in stock.  So I had to go online to find them and of course Amazon did.  Not only was the refills cheaper, but instead of getting a 2 refill pack I was able to get a 3 refill pack cheaper than what Walmart sold with only 2 in their package.  I would highly recommend this product to anyone who own a Braun shaver with a cleaning system.	12
I caught over 18 rabbits, 1 squirrel and 1 feral cat with this trap within the first month of its use. The trap is well constructed and holds up to heavy abuse by the trapped animals. The only reason I gave it 4/5 is that it takes two hands to open the trap. If I ever catch a skunk I am going to be in for a stinky experience. It would be nice if this trap had a quick release mechanism that could be operated from a little distance and a long pole of some sort.	18
I couldn't believe when they said they were going to crowd source the funding for this movie. But they actually did it and then some. my wife and I have always loved the series, and couldn't believe that they stopped it like they did., a la deadwood, pushing daisies, Fire Fly etc. anyway we loved the movie, we didn't see it in the movie theater, but we have Amazon prime and were able to rent it for 4 bucks....What a great deal. They left the ending so it almost looks like they could do another movie, which would be great!	0
I used to wear American Apparel, worked for a while but noticed they ran a little hot and shrunk over time. These boxers are free of both issues, dry quick, don't ride up/bunch/wedge and are super light. These are perfect day to day, don't let the travel marketing deter you.I've replaced 80% of my underwear line up with these over time and don't regret it one bit. If you can get them directly on Amazon with free shipping its cheaper by $5+ than anywhere else online/retail.	8
"I do like this product but can not say ""I love it"" because I am constantly looking for a good moisturizer.  MY face is sensitive and dry and it is difficult to find a product that isn't too greasy,too smelly,or too expensive.  I can't afford to buy $50.00 moisturizers; I am a retired 68 year old senior living on restricted budget; however I do care to look nice.  I do not like the dispenser, I would prefer a jar and not this pumping action."	4
After reading the reviews I decided to purchase the book, but was disappointed how quickly the heroine fell into her x-lovers arms.  His father was ruthless and even knowing his son was in love he set him up to destroy the relationship.  He didn't even know he had a son - after 6 years!!!  I will say that once he made the effort nothing - even his parents - stood in his way of restoring what he had lost out on - the first 5 years of his son's life.	14
Wanted to buy a better stand than the cheap metal folding one that I'd had in high school.  This was a great compromise between portability/storage and sturdiness.  I did want collapsible legs, which this has, and the solid coated metal shelf is wonderful after my old metal folding stand.  Works well with the Manhasset second shelf accessory, and has been in constant use for months now.  I've had absolutely no problems with it.  The height is easily adjustable, and the shelf tilt is easy too.  Am very happy with what I got for the price I paid!	16
My friend has lost 12 lbs so far using this app. Told me about it & in less than 2 wks I have lost 4 lbs. My husband just started using it & he likes how easy it is to look up food before he eats. Would definitely recommend to anyone wanting to eat healthier & smarter. If you eat out a lot, you need this app. You'll be surprised at the calories! Way more than you need in a day in just one meal!! Get this app, you'll love it	1
We use the diaper depot for our Pack and Play playard. It's not a perfect fit, but it works, and it sure beats running around to get diapers, wipes, etc. I gave the diaper depot 5 stars despite two things:1) The opening for the diaper stacker is a little big, so sometimes an extra diaper slides out. In Prince Lionheart's defense, this may be necessary to accomodate larger sized diapers.2) The side containers could have been a little deeper.Besides these minor nuiances, it's a great product.	3
I was very excited to find this app, but I had a little trouble figuring it all out.  I guess I would have liked a little explanation of what it all meant, but after a while I was able to use it a little.  I'm sure that many people had no trouble at all, but then I'm not the most clever when it comes to these things.  If I were, I wouldn't need a &#34;Convertor Pro&#34;, would I?  I will spend more time and rise to the challenge & in the end, I shall conquer!	1
"It has some flaws, you will have to run around a bit between play areas, but it plays well enough.  The price is right, and it is worth the time you will spend on it.  The learning curve is small, and there are music sound tracks buried deep in the CD if you look for them (a neat extra).  It has been around a couple of years and there is nothing new (though you do have a ""partner"" you can exploit during battle), .  I liked it enough to want to finish it; I think you will too.FlaviusMaximus"	23
I've been trying to find out how to get in touch with the developer since I downloaded this app. It will record and save the conversation, but it WILL NOT PLAY BACK! I have even forwarded to myself in an email only to have an empty file arrive. I have done everything as instructed and verified that indeed there is a recording there that lists an amount of time, e.g. 3 minutes, 32 seconds, but it won't even start to play! How in the world do I get it to play back??	1
Total conjecture about what might have happened with a lost Roman Legion.  Still, more or less true to the times, and the interactions between soldiers in a war in a far away country when part of a Global Empire.  Down at the personal level though effected by the big issues.Generally good performances by all important characters.  A few illogical scenes, but not to many, and none puncture the suspension of belief any good movie requires.Give it a shot if you are interested, you likely won't be much disappointed.	0
this product is well made.  It really works as far as holding in your waist and improving your posture.  The only issue that I have is that you can definitely see the boning and snaps under anything that's not too thick (i.e. a t-shirt or a tank)  I won't be able to wear this under any fitted dresses......  oh well, I will continue to wear it for at least 8 hrs a day, 5 days a week and see if I get the results that others have stated they got.	8
If you have a tough repair job that requires plastic tape, this should  be a tape thick enough for you.  Like all Scotch products, it is a quality product. It's designed, obviously, for repairing books, but I can find a lot more uses for it than that.  For example, the other day I used it to repair a paperback art book cover because the thin film covering was pealing up, and the tape worked fine, as expected.  I suspect too it will last a lot longer than the shoddy cover on the new book I bought recently!Highly recommended.	17
"The binder is a nice quality easy-touch 3-ring. But what makes this set especially nice is the dividers. Included are 5 sets of 5, with one set of traditional labels, one set of ""easy labels,"" and one practice sheet. Templates are downloadable from Avery.The easy-tabs ensure that the divider labels align, which is a nice touch. I'm going to see if I can pick these up in colored labels -- that would be sweet and perfect for how I use this product (essentially a career portfolio)."	17
This is a great box-set of some of the episodes of &quot;W.K.R.P. In Cincinnati&quot; - the best sit-com in T.V.-history !. You won't find a better written, more perfectly cast, gloriously acted, and funnier show  anywhere. However, these 8 episodes are by no means the best ones. -They're  all waiting to be released. Hopefully &quot;New Video&quot; will put the  whole series out. No other sit-com deserves it more, I can assure you. So  please, how about it ?. But in the meantime, get this box and wet your  appetite. K.r.p. rules !.	15
This kept the Tinea Versicolcor at bay more so than eradicating it. I do think that combined with prescribed products this aided tremendously in my finally getting rid of the skin discoloration. The only setback is the smell. It may have been that my PH just didn't mesh well with it, but it had a strong medicinal smell that forced me to use it only before bed, instead of during the day as I would have liked.Despite the smell I am likely going to be purchasing this again if I notice the discoloration is rearing its ugly head again.	4
I have purchased many Kingston Micro Cards over time and have always found them reliable, fast and easy to handle.  I use them on my GPS, HD video camera, Samsung tablet, laptops and including my desktop.  I do not remember one failing me as they are totally reliable. That is important to me as I handle them a lot...back and forth from my laptop and my other electronic equipment for my music, my guitar recordings, lyrics....etc.  I have not hesitation to recommend them highly to others.	10
I'm not going to educate anyone about the genuine and authentic timeless classic that is the Levi 501 Jean.Nor do I want to listen to the whining about them not being the same quality as they were 20 years ago. Maybe they aren't or maybe they are, but these are what's available today and they remain a stone cold classic blue jean.What I really like about ordering them on Amazon is the many choices of colors in the sizes I need at a more then fair price.  Can't be beat.	8
"First off, I love Zeppelin and The Song Remains the Same is an excellent live album and film.  But let me just pose a question:  Why is Amazon advertising this HDDVD if according to them it's not being released for 2 more years?  Huh??!!  By that time we could be downloading movies directly into our heads - a little ""Led for your head,"" so to speak.  Seriously Amazon, either figure out what's going on or take down this item."	6
I loved this app on my iPhone so I installed it for my Samsung Charge.  Firstly it hogs RAM and always runs in the background even if you kill it.  I didn't have an issue with photo quality as mentioned here but the banners that are on the screen block half of my album list.  It actually would generate errors on install originally. I had emailed the developer and he wrote back immediately.  We got it installed but the ram and running in the background issues were causing lag in the phone so I uninstalled it.	1
"I was betrayed by a dog ""expert"" that swears by these that they're the greatest thing ever.  I suspect Planet Dog has in fact betrayed them by letting their quality control slip.  The green parts are glued on, but not very well.  I don't leave any toys with my dog unsupervised but my puppy ripped Australia off and swallowed it in only a minute of play.  Several of the other continents are peeling off and hanging my a thread.  I felt like returning the ball with the green piece, poop and all."	19
This little boat was a good price and came with the oars (they are expensive if you purchase alone).  I got this boat and the oars for only $4-5 more than just the oars, so we were happy, we now have two little boats (and yes, one set of oars).  Great for a pool or paddling around in water close to shore.  I wouldn't send it out in the water too far - no idea how it would hold up, but we've had ours for a year and it's still holding original air, so that boasts well for the quality.	20
I bought these because I am constantly loosing screws when I change pickguards or do new builds.These are exactly what the doctor ordered.  Original equipment so they're the right screws,  A must have for every guitarist, no matter what brand you own as they work on everything.These are well made and don't strip when screwing in for the first time.  If it's a new project, always drill pilot holes anyway.  I am so glad I bought these, one by one they are being used...almost time to order another set.I store them in a little sandwich bag.  5 stars	16
I gave this 5 stars because it is what it is and it's what is sold all around in RV repair/sales shops...personally, I don't think it's so heavy duty, but it's the best one on the market. I've checked out many of them in my travels at RV stores and they cost much more than what I paid for this one. It works, it does mark easily so be careful about rubbing the hitch crank on it, but it is a good buy here on Amazon.com.	2
I bought the LP of this a few days ago, It's really good.  It's not &quot;Songs on the key of life&quot;, but if you are a person that likes Stevie's eariler work, this is for you (if you ever bought the LP  &quot;Looking Back&quot;, the three record set and liked it, you should get  this.)  Everything that Stevie has done is great, this album is no  exception.  I only have the LP, so I don't know if the CD version is messed  up, but Motown is pretty good about re-releasing things.	9
"I just received my package of Stevita Supreme stevia ""sweetener"". It is the most repulsive tasting sweetener I have ever used. I'm sure saccharine is better tasting than this stuff! I did a side my side comparison of Stevita, aspartame and Splenda. The aspartame and Splenda are both decent tasting, and the Stevita is HORRIBLE! Bitter, and tasting of some sort of chemical.Thank-god it was only [...] bucks with free delivery because it's probably going in the trash or to a soup kitchen - though the homeless certainly deserve better than this stuff."	11
I had this book in my TBR pile and really wasn't in any sort of hurry to read it. Now, after finishing it, I can't believe I waited so long.This book gives me an in depth account of circus life during the depression and of the lifestyles of those who traveled with it. I learned a lot. I however, got really emotional when aspects of the book dealt with animal cruelty and even human cruelty to each other.This is a must read book. The ending is also a surprise.	5
The problem with modern production techniques is they compress the dynamics, making everything loud; then they increase the volume past the technical limits of the CD. This is evident on the Clockwork Angels release, and there are many areas where it is impossible to hear the nuances of Neil Peart's drumming, to follow Geddy Lee's bass lines, or to tell just what exactly Alex Lifeson is doing on his guitar. The mix wasn't as bad as the original master of Vapor Trails, but it is clearly not as good as it should have been.	6
Yes, I was suprised by how easy this can opener worked.  Having been the sole can opener in my household, I was used to our previous opener which died on us.  The first time I used this OXO opener, I was immediately impressed with how easy it was to squeeze the handles and even easier to twist the lever.I wanted to open more cans as this little jem is a real pleasure to use.I've had it about a month so far and it is still working just as great as the day I received it.	13
I've only been using this moisturizer for a little over a week and I can already feel the difference in my skin.  My foundation goes on smoothly and my skin feels moisturized all day.  I have been using Aveeno for years but I like this moisturizer so much better.I work at a skilled nursing facility and the residents with the nicest skin ALL say that they've been using Oil of Olay for decades.  If that doesn't make you want to try it for yourself, I don't know what will.	4
Jedi Knight is a first person shooter game, like Doom, or Quake, but with a Star Wars twist.  To me the familiar Star Wars aliens and even the new ones make this game a true joy to play.  Jedi Knight easily has one of the  best game soundtracks ever with the booming symphony sounds in the  backgroud.  The graphics and gameplay are also a sight to be seen.  A  truely fantastic game, anyone who enjoys first person shooters should try  this one out.	23
Lately, there seems no difference between polishing compound/rubbing compound. The latter used to refer to very coarse material but this no longer seems true.I use this compound mostly on plastics and it can remove residual adhesive, scratches, etc... It can also be used to polish clear coat layer on metallic paint. Paint whatever with metallic paint first, then spray a few layers of clear paint (gloss). Wait a day or two to completely dry and lightly polish with this compound & soft cloth. You'd be happy with the result.	2
I've had mine for years and it works great. I use primarily at the Miter Saw since that's the only tool in my shop that is stationary. For any small shop it works great. This used to be my DC for my basement shop before I moved into the garage. The only problem I had with it was on my belt/disc sander. It didn't pick up the dust that well but the there was roughly 25 feet of hose and PVC to go thru. Not the DC's fault. Overall, I'd recommend it for any small shop	21
Wonderful product. We bought this as a gift for my son's 7th birthday as a fun incentive to get him a little writing and spelling practice.  He loved to make his own books at home with computer paper and the stapler, so a real book was a huge hit.  He thought this was great because it is a real bound book with his own words and pictures.  His book will be a cherished keepsake and I'm sure it will be great fun to look at when he is grown.	22
For anyone who likes board games, miniature games or Sci Fi in general or Star Wars in particular, this is a great, fun, simple game that can be a beer 'n' pretzels affair or deeply tactical if you want it to be.The presentation and build of the models and included card stock pieces is first rate. The packaging protective and re-usable and the delivery I received from Amazon was super speedy.It's Darth's ship. You gotta have Darth Vader in the collection, or it wouldn't be Star Wars. The abilities the pack adds are also great.	22
THIS CD IS ANOTHER CLASSIC RECORD BY THE INFAMOUS 2PAC/MAKAVELI. THIS 2CD SET FEATURES OVER 25 SONGS (27 TO BE EXACT) THAT NEED TO BE HEARD. IF YOU CAN'T FIND THIS CD ANYWHERE, YOU CAN GET THE &quot;DIGITALY REMASTERED&quot; VERSION, WITH THE &quot;2 OF AMERIKAZ MOST WANTED&quot; VIDEO. THIS CD SHOULD ALSO BE PICKED UP IF YOU SEE IT ANYWHERE. I HONESTLY ADVISE YOU TO LISTEN TO DISC 2 BEFORE DISC 1, BECAUSE DISC 2 EXPLAINS MORE ABOUT LIFE, DISC 1 EXPLAINS ABOUT DEATH ROW FEELINGS. BUT WHATEVER. BUY IT WHEN YOU CAN.	9
I have restored an old REX Commander.  Yeah, I know;  never heard of it.  Beautiful old archtop acoustic with real mother of pearl rectangular inlays on the neck.  Frets filed nearly flat after over a half century of playing.  But the resonance of the D'Addario's really bring this old guitar to life with a thick juicy vibrance on the bass side, and bell like clarity on the treble side.  Not to mention how great they look.  The snap and sparkle of the responsiveness of these stings amazes me.  Terrific strings for the price of cheapies.	16
I really enjoyed this game. It was nice to be able to slow down the fireballs for certain levels so I could keep track. Even on the slowest setting some of the levels could still be pretty challenging at first. I played this on Kindle Fire. Probably would be harder on a small phone.Only thing that keeps it from being a 5 star is that there aren't enough levels. I finished the whole thing in a couple of hours. I also wish there was some bonus for finishing every level with a perfect score.	1
"I bought a set of these ramps and they flat out don't work on my 2010 Dodge Ram 1500 4x2.  In my garage and/or on an asphalt parking lot they don't stay put.  When I drive up them they slide forward and my truck just scoots them along.  I have to ""hold"" them in place by using rubber floor mats and/or wood stoppers.  Yes, they have the rubber feet on their base but they don't hold.  Hate them....and wouldn't buy them again.  I returned them."	2
I've tried a number of liquid and powdered stevias, and this is by far my favorite.  My husband stole my bottle after he tried it, because he loves it in his iced tea, and he's never liked the stevias I've bought before.  The flavors are fun for coffee, but the plain is fantastic for iced tea.  It has no carbs, unlike powdered stevias, if you're a carb counter.  I emailed their support and asked.If you get a bitter aftertaste, you're definitely using too much.  Start with a few drops and go from there.	11
This roll of sticky backed Velcro is the handiest stuff when you need to stick something up, down, or sideways. I have a large computer system, and a 7 port USB hub that I could not keep in one spot. It kept sliding around and falling off the back of my desk. So, I bought this Velcro, and stuck the hub to my desk top. Now it don't go nowhere. But, it has so many more uses as well. Anything that needs to be stuck in place, but still be removeable is a candidate for Velcro. Great product.	17
"I have owned this book for a few months. I keep getting side tracked by other books so I did not read it. Last week so many people told me how wonderful the book was and even the movie. SO, I picked it up last night and am almost done with it. WOW!!! What a wonderful story. You can tell a lot of research went into this by the accuracy. While I know very little about circus life I do work with the elderly and that is all accurate. A lot on the lines of ""The Notebook"" the way the story in told."	5
I've used Splash ID since the Palm m505 days.  Over the years it's been very reliable and stable.  It doesn't offer as much GUI distractions as some of the other password storage programs, so it does look/feel dated.  However, when combined with the new desktop manager, I still cannot imagine life without it.  If you are carrying over an old .VID file, the new one requires a lot of patience to properly import everything.  Splash Data's customer service was helpful to fix some of my mistakes.	1
"The author has real writing ability; I can't stress this strongly enough.  She has what they call: ""Turn of phrase.""  But the running internal monologue of Maud, the main character, got old after the first half.On the positive side, I liked all the characters, and lots of the vignettes were believable when thinking about small-town life.  But a bunch of vignettes strung together didn't make a workable book for me.  The theme of The Muse lost and The Muse found wasn't strong enough to carry the book.I would be very interested in reading other work by this author, whose talent is not in question."	14
This is a sturdy, well-made version of a common design. The biggest difference between this one and the others I have had is that this one really works.It's stable at the hinge and doesn't easily twist or mis-align. The lock mechanism works, holding them closed to a fairly narrow opening.I was at my daughter's the other day, and she and I were joking about the junky pair she has: the lock locks them at about halfway open. Why bother?These are good tongs. I'm only holding back one star because I wish they were 100% stainless steel.	13
56 oz of coffee creamer is a lot and I pour smaller amounts in a small creamer container to avoid spilling. This is really the best creamer I have used. I don't care for the various flavors and prefer the plain or original creamer. At this time of reviewing it has other creamers online, by half the price.If you are like me and like a lot of plain cream, IE...Half & Half, etc... then you will love Nestle Coffee Mate because it is rich and smooth. It is the BEST.	11
This is another product I've used for years to keep my face clean. I'm almost 70 and people say I look 20 years younger so keeping the facial skin free of oil and dirt must have some merit. Buf-Puf are a bit hard to find but luckily we have Amazon. Gave one to my granddaughter to help her avoid Acne and show her how to avoid oil and bacteria caused pimples. Buf-Puf Gentle has a little scrubbing action which helps to remove dead skin and keep the skin glowing. Recommended highly for daily use.	4
Yes I admit this was a good record, and sold over 7 million copies what ever! MR&gt;SKQUINTO again Paula was just new yes HOT was was predicted to last.  But better than Madonna and Janet BOY you got issues. Wheres Paula now? But I must say Forever your girl is a good album, But its forgoten, Even madonna's true blue is still is notice especially the album cover, sold more than 7.4 million copies in the US alone ill throw that in for record. Paula had her time, but now shes KNOCKED OUT!!! by madonna and janet...........................................	9
Abandoned drop-out Cornell vetLooks after all the circus petsFalls in love with someone's wife,Of her he'll think for all his life.Barbara's chest or the Fat Lady--It's all good ol' hyperbole,They'll make you laugh and maybe cry,But you feel they're just a circus sight:When show's over all shuffle home,Men to bars and tigers to bones,Adulterous romps can only so long last,Hands part and hearts get stuck in the forever past.(Must Love always beGood ol' hyperbole?)	5
I own and love my Mexico the Beautiful Cookbook, so I decided to invest, and at 50 dollars it IS an investment, in the Italian edition. I was severely dissapointed in it. The photography is indeed as beautiful as the Mexico book, but the recipes are rather blah. I greatly prefer my books by Marcella Hazzan, especially her Essentials of Classical Italian Cooking.After using Hazzan's books, this one left me cold. I gave it away, and that is rare, as I collect cookbooks. Save your money.	5
Review of New Trent iTorch(IMP52D):The iTorch is an incredibly useful tool for any road warrior. It lets you fully charge your phone and then some. I love the design and size of the device. It charges with the ubiquitous micro-USB cable, and it can charge anything via a USB Cable. I always keep it in my bag just in case. The only small issue I have is the amount of time it takes to fully charge. It take a few hours to get from zero to 100%. This is expected, but is still a significant amount of time. 4/5.	7
This strap replaces another one just like it which I use with an acoustic guitar for giving lessons.  For stage I like something heavier.  Good quality.  The holes work with my strap buttons okay.  My lower button is an output jack for an after-market pickup which is wider than a normal strap button.  But this strap works okay with it.  It just takes a little more force to get it on which I'm sure will go away over time with use.  Great price for a simple strap at around $5.	16
I used this tape to mask on a particle board, and it help OK. I did have a hard time tearing it, which is a good thing and a bad thing. As usual, there is a trade-off.Overall, I prefer the blue painters tape for most applications: it does not damage the painted surface as this tape would. At the same time, this tape will allow you to mask long and straight lines much faster.I always considered the blue tape to be way expensive, but this tape is 1.5 times more expensive. Hence, in my opinion, the blue tape wins.	17
I've used D'Addario's on so many different Guitar's the only opinion I can honestly give Ya is that They are the best. In the Studio or on Stage, They stay in tune and work very well with any pickup You are using. I put these on My Wife's Bass cause She is still learning and with a Fender Squire it sounds almost as good as a Precision Fender Bass. They stay true to the note so She will get to know what the pitch and note should sound like every time......	16
"Had this for sevral months now and I love it. I love the touch screen which lets me see the covers of books in COLOR!VERY easy to set up account with B&N; using my nook. It serches for wi-fi and is very easy.Anytime I have had any problem, a simple re-boot fixes it.I love the ""free Friday"" that is offered. I have read SOOO many books since I bought it.I also think I would like the ""Lend Me"" option if any of my friends HAD a nook."	10
This shines as sort of an EDC type sharpener for Smaller blades.Great for your pocket knife, or neck knife.  Its pretty short, so it difficult to get a lot of purchaseon your blade with anything larger, though I guess it could be done if you really tried.Originally got this to test as part of a minimalist kit for use as my sharpener.....I decided there weredefinitely better options for that.This is one of those purchases that ended up totally working out, just not how I thought, as this thing is always with mein my day to day routine.	20
I purchased this gate at Babies R Us, but read the reviews first from Amazon.  I just purchased a toddler bed for my child and the gate is used to keep her in her bedroom at night.  The gate was so easy to put together and fits perfectly at the entrance of her bedroom door.  To open it, all you do is step on the foot pedal, which is needs weight to open.  The only problem I have now, is that my child closes the gate all the time.  When it's suppose to stay open.  Oh, well!!	3
"The brush seems to be well-made and is very comfortable, but the bristles are extremely firm, I think they would only work on veggies like carrots and potatoes. The handle of this brush appears to be made completely of a rubberized plastic and is about 3 1/2 inches x 2 inches. The bristles are very short at about 1/2 of an inch long. As for the supposed ""flexible"" quality of the brush, I haven't noticed any flexilibity so I don't really know what they are talking about, but that is neither here nor there."	13
I needed a 1/2 inch curling iron and this one works just fine for my needs.  I have one of the same model in the one inch and I liked it, so ordered the same model in the smaller size.  I like that it turns itself off after a certain period of time because I often forget to do so.  I also like that you can adjust the heat or strength of curl.  I have had many Conair products over the years and have been satisfied with all of them.	4
As many people complained, I found this headset's microphone was very weak. The other person can not hear me at all.  So I contacted Plaintronics for repair.  Their repair process has no tracking, just sending in your headset to an address.  Two weeks later, I received a used one back, not the one I sent in, packaged in an OEM box. Although this one has better microphone than the new one I sent in, it battery is not very reliable to hold charge, also the battery portion is kind of loose.I can not recommend Plantronics product at all.	7
...once the painter at my house told me how the thing actually works, I was really impressed by this ladder.  It does everything and is really stable thanks to the wide feet.  Hopefully all the contraptions that provide these options stay working for a long time.  The painter offered to buy it from me and, when I asked why, he said that these are durable and flexible - they last.  So I'll hold him to it.  Sent him to Amazon to buy his own.  (P.S. The UPS guy was not impressed by this box.)	21
This saw is fairly large  and takes a little getting used to.  It cuts on the pull stroke and so has a very fine flexible blade.  Does a great job on plain old firing and also on hardwoods.  Indispensable addition to the shop although it is moderately large and takes some effort to find a good place for storage.  The current handle is plastic and doesn't see to be particularly sturdy but no signs on any problems so far.A great tool but like power tools should only be used by kids with direct supervision.	21
"WOW THAS all I can say, this speedloader has saved my fingers, after having to load over 70K in ammo by hand. I.E. using my bare hands no help, the blisters were painfull, NOW this little wonderful gadget has saved my fingers and my fellow ""armorers"" fingers, you slide the mag into the unit, and as the instructions say, you just squeeze, insert and release and push..OMG i was able to load 5 mags each with 15rnds, in less than a min. HIGHLY RECOMMEND this..can't wait till the others arrive."	20
When it comes to tape, there's nothing else like the Scotch-brand. Unlike other less-familiar brands, Scotch is dependable. This 3-pack of GiftWrap tape provides what Scotch-brand users have come to depend upon - a dispenser that dispenses a tape with a satin finish that will virtually disappear when you use it on most gift wrap. It dispenses easily, tears off without a hitch, and sticks securely, no questions asked. You don't have to worry about whether it's going to stick or not. This 3/4 inch 3-roll pack is perfect to have on-hand for Christmas.	17
This light is pretty worthless.  It kills lots of moths and other non-biting bugs but didn't put a dent in the mosquito or fly population.  I got this as an alternative to my unreliable SkeeterVac but it does not work and is equally unreliable.  The bulbs blew after 1 season.  Replacement bulbs are $40 each plus shipping.  It takes 2.  That is $90 for 2 bulbs and I only paid $80 for the whole unit.  Thanks but no thanks.Unfortunately, the only thing I've found that actually catches mosquitoes is the propane powered devices.  They are all unreliable too.  Skip the zappers and traps and use deet.	18
"I needed a gate for the top of the stairs, and searched Amazon for ""baby gate top of stairs.""  This gate is the second item returned.  Nowhere in the description does it say that this gate should not be used at the top of the stairs.  Of course as soon as we opened the box the instructions clearly say DO NOT USE AT THE TOP OF STAIRS.  The gate works great in the upstairs hallway, but we'll still need to buy a different gate at some point if we want the baby to have access to our room."	3
"The front of the bottle has in orange ""Lutein and Zeaxanthin"" to catch your attention, but this is deceptive marketing because one cap only has 2 mg of Lutein and Zeaxanthin. No, that's not even 2 mg of each; it is 2mg of the two blended together!I bought these for my mom and also tried them myself. They are useless. Buy something else that is more honest and actually delivers. You want something with 6-20 mg of lutein. Icaps are expensive, dishonest, a scam, and useless. Unfortunately, they are probably the most widely available eye supplements."	12
The DMT family of knife sharpening products are top shelf kit.  I use them in the kitchen and in the garage, from sharpening a shovel (yes, it really works better when the edge is sharp) to sharpening steak knives.  These were purchased to add to my truck tool box, small, easy to stow away.  They work very well, just remember to let the sharpening edge do the work for you, do NOT press down hard, you will just remove the diamond media and ruin the surface.	20
this episode is a good one, Jesse tries to get a job since his partner don't want to continue making money off drugs. Walt and his wife goes to a old friend birthday party. Jesse meet his old friend after a bad job interview. They hook up to make crystal meth but it goes wrong when Jesse tries to make it perfect like his old partner, meanwhile Welt is offer a jod by his old only because the friend was told Walt was dying by his wife. Later on in the show Jesse & Walt are back at it.	0
I had purchased two of these drying towels as I had read that these may not work as well as advertised. WAS I WRONG! The towel easily soaked up all the water that was coming off the car, leaving it spotless. I had a friend help me with the second towel and I was able to dry my car in record time and not have any water marks left on the paint. I just slid the towel over any parts with water and it left no trace of water and a clean shine to my car.	2
LOVE these glasses!  They are high quality and have the chin strap to hold them on!  LOVE these glasses- and my Boston Terrier leaves them on!He got so much attention at the local festival.Ordered the small for my 9 pound puppy - he could have easily worn an XSOrdered the medium for my 33-35 pound large Boston - FITS HIM PERFECTLY.Ordered the XL for the 100 pound pit bull that I was keeping.  They were too large.  He could have easily worn the Large.  :-)Hope this helps!OVERALL, GREAT product!!! Will order again in more colors!! A+++	19
I've owned this product for about a year and it performs exactly as required.  I use this for dovetailing and for edge routing.  Very powerfull and very precise.  You still need two wrenches to change the bit, but what's new?The D-Handle is comfortable and ergonomic. Since it plugs into the handle, you can unplug the motor once it's stopped and it balances perfectly on its top.Single speed but so what, this has been in the P-C line for quite some time and still a fine tool.	21
I use this to clean out all sorts of cups and bottles and it always maintains its shape.  Been using it for almost a year now and its still going strong.  Its really only for light cleaning though because the brush bristles are too soft to do much scrubbing, but they are the right softness to easily squish into a small bottle opening, which is what I bought it for.  I'd buy it again with the knowledge that its just a light duty brush specifically for water bottles/jugs.	12
THIS IS A GIANT TRAP! I never knew that mouse traps could be so well made. If you think of your regular size mousetrap and multiply times 5 you get this well made TOMCAT RAT TRAP. This could catch a large cat because of its size and weight. The steel is twice as thick as a wire coat hanger or more. The wood is large and heavy. Only get this trap for a huge rat...not small mice. Be careful when setting it because it can easily break your fingers. It is quality made and is huge.	18
I absolutely love Tomb Raider. It is definitely my favorite game of all time. It has everything you need to make a wonderfully fun game. There is action and adventure, thriller, problem solving, and an entertaining story line. I love the challenge of the problem solving. It isn't a game you can finish in a couple hours, but take a long time to get through all of the different puzzles. You definitely get your moneys worth with play time on this game. It will always keep you thinking. I couldn't ask for a better game.	23
Characters come and go, and the only characters I still care about are the Starks, of many of whom there seems to be almost no word in the last two books. I thought the third book was starting to slow down, the fourth one was just a lot of padding, and the fifth one is trying to get started again. Better than the previous one, too many words that get nowhere, still an interesting read. Let's hope the next installment will come faster than the five years it took to get this one done.	5
"This is worth getting alone for the second episode ""The Deadly Dolls"" guest-starring the great Vincent Price.  While the plot is similar to so many other Voyage episodes with the crew being taken over by aliens desiring the Seaview's nuclear reactor, the combination of Vincent and the hysterical Nelson and Crane puppets make this one an absolute pleasure.It is interesting to ponder how great Voyage would have been had it continued the combination of sci-fi and James Bond-type episodes seen during its second, and best, season."	0
Why do we Americans love British period pieces so much? Maybe because they transport us to a world we know very little about, a world that appears to have order and decorum -- at least on the surface. But beneath the surface -- downstairs, if you will -- there's conflict and pain and confusion and drama due primarily to the changing times. I think the latest version of U.D. does a great job of bringing the original up to date, to the mid to late 30s. The characters are fascinating and well defined, the story lines are relevant to the time. Thouroughly enjoyable.	15
This is an RPG stripped of the roleplaying elements and reduced to a hack-and-slash. But it's a _fun_ hack-and-slash, and that's what matters, right? There's a nice variety of baddies to go after, especially if you buy  the Hellfire add-on. Don't buy if you're prone to repetitive-motion  injuries, because you'll be clicking the mouse nearly constantly throughout  much of the game; and watch out for cheaters in the multiplayer arena. But  take it for what it is--a fun romp through a dungeon full of monsters  carrying around gold coins for no obvious reason--and you can't go wrong.	23
As silly as it sounds this is great stuff to have around the house.  Especially around my house!  I have lots of hobbies that require use of silicone grease.  Lubricating o-rings is the number one use.  O-rings are found everywhere it seams. Faucets, my Pelican cases that store my electronics, my scuba gear, air filter housings on my ATVs and motorcycles, lawn equipment, air compressor accessories, I use it everywhere!  If you're a DIYer it pays to have a little jar of this stuff on your work bench. It's not expensive and really comes in handy!!!	20
this book is very touching as in you knew that deep down that the charcters loved each other, no matter what because overall love conquers all in the end. I wished the males could have been detailed more of their back ground but all in all good book. idk it felt like it was missing something from somewhere but maybe thats just me, it started from a different place especially of this kind genre, which i liked alot, like some of the others wrote you don't really read about the ups and downs during arelationship over the years. all in all good book	14
Probably one of the best games for RPG players.  However, too expensive currently (as of August 2006).  I bought the PC version and the Playstation version years back and still have them.  The PC version does look better especially during fight scenes.  Unfortunately, for use on Windows XP you have to get a software patch for later in the game (chocobo race).  Great great game.  I would say 'shame on you' to the sellers that are charging so much for the games but I understand their reasons.Find it cheap, buy it, play it, enjoy it!	23
I'm sure this isn't the best echo pedal (or even in the top 100), but it serves it's purpose fairly well. Stacking with other cheap danelectro pedals will degrade your tone but it isn't something that most of us can't live with. for 14.99 us it's worth taking the risk IMHOUpdate: The pedal gave up the ghost (died) In a relatively short amount of time. I replaced it with  mini modtone type delay.... I actually like the dano sound better, but the modtone will do for a slapback and it is built way better.	16
Brand loyalty aside, the NOOK HD AND the Kindle FIRE HD are both great products. I have a Barnes & Noble store about one mile away. I called with some typical learning curve operating questions and was treated with courtesy and competence. my After my poor effort to explain the issues on the phone, the local B & N NOOK expert offered to come IN PERSON to help me. Took about 15 minutes.Try that with Amazon! LOLNow with Google Play. An exceptional product with exceptional people backing it up.	10
I love spicing up various bland foods like rice, potato dishes, with Five-Spice powder.  This is a great, interesting spice that not everyone has been exposed to.  Few recipes call for it, other than Asian ones.  Unfortunately, I live in a small rural town and cannot find this spice in any of the grocery stores.  Thanks to Amazon, I not only can purchase it, but it comes at a fair, competitive price.  Living where I do, Amazon is the only convenient mall I have, and I am so grateful for it.	11
With all of the raves from you folks who own this on VHS, I checked under DVDs for Stevie Ray Vaughan on Amazon and found that it is coming out on DVD as of September 4, 2007.  Thus, I preordered it.  I am obsessed (my wife's words with which I pretty much agree) with SRV.  I own all of his DVDs and his commercially available CDs, along with some bootleg CDs.  This will complete my DVD collection on SRV....for now, anyway. Here is how to find this one on Amazon:Pride and Joy	6
Can't stand perfume and its in everything. ( Perfumed toilet paper is just strange!) This is great for me,doesn't take forever to be absorbed. I have it on auto ship. Sent to me every other month cause I have my husband use it too. He's had a lot of skin cancer on his face and this spf 15 is just enough for regular daily use. I use this in the morning and a heavier one at night. The dermatologist says my 65 year old skin looks great even with her magnifying glass. Lets keep it that way!	4
I don't understand why they put fragrance in a facial cleanser.  I am allergic and am not able to use this cold cream.  It gave me a migraine and an asthma flare-up.Also I am disappointed that it did not remove my mascara and did NOT do a good job at removing my eyeliner either.  I don't wear heavy makeup so this should not have been an issue for this product.  It's really too bad because it is a good price and I can't afford more expensive products.	4
"Does what it says it will do and it does it very well. The connector is a 3/8in female slot so make sure whatever it is you're buying can connect to that. The mic/boom stand I bought and the on desk stand were both 5/8in male so I had to buy 2 cheap adapters (6$ each). I also am having some issues really ""locking"" in the Audio-Technica condenser mic to the shock mount. So far it stays in, but isn't ""super"" secure (wobbles just a little if it's moved), but maybe I'm just doing it wrong. Aside from that, though, great product."	16
I'm such a huge Michael fan, I love everything he does. Moonwalker is so  good, I loved every minute of it, I have watched it so many times. I Cannot  wait until his new movie comes out next year, He's going to be portraying  Edgar Allen Poe. Believe me I'll be the first in line to watch it. Michael  is a genius, there is no other male singer that can come close to Michael.  He is the true King. I'll always be a Michael Jackson Fan, I'm not ashamed  to say that.	6
Michael Kitchen playing Christopher Foyle is not a super slueth, he is more like the quiet, patient grandfather type.  His doggish style for solving complex mysteries is great to watch and makes him a fearsome opponent.  This English made series runs at a different pace than we are used to in the U.S., which makes it a welcome change.  My wife and I were hooked from the very first show of the first season.  Because this series lacks the excessive violence and action of most U.S. shows, I suspect this series would appeal more to the older generations.	0
I just received my Python No Spill Clean and Fill system and I have to tell you what a diffrence it has made in cleaning my tank. I have a 55 gallon freshwater tank and it is well established and has very large fish. I used to dread cleaning and propper maintance due to the fact of using a bucket and killing my back. I was done in record time and not one drop on the floor. Will not use anything else now and will not dread waterchanges and vacuming the tank. Wish I would have found this years ago!	19
We bought these to use on our save-the-date cards and wedding invitations, and they worked out great. Just the right size for regular envelopes, and the look was exactly what we were going for.One suggestion - if you're not using the whole page of labels, and want to use the remaining labels later, take a piece of white paper, and tape it over the labels you are not using. The labels get darker every time you run them through the printer. It's hard to notice on the page, but once you affix them to the envelope, they can look a bit dirty.	17
What a lovely story this was! I feel like it was witten for hollywood, I cant wait to see the movie. I loved the fact that the story was remembered by an old man. The author REALLY got what it feels like to be old and she makes you get it also. I felt like I was right in the story, I read through this wonderful book in a few days. My only complaint is that it wasnt a little bit longer. This is only about 300 pages but I felt it should have been more.	5
I read this book long before I saw the movie and I definitely say that it lived up to my expectations.  Jane Eyre is a timeless story and it is beautifully captured in this gothic tale of romance and hidden secrets.  Each character is portrayed very well.  Samantha Morton (who plays Jane Eyre), actually became her seemingly meek and yet truly passionate character before my very eyes.  I would recommend this film to anyone who loved the book, as well as anyone who loves romance and a bit of mystery.	15
"MeTalHeaD4Ever ""DEath"" pretty much hit the nail on the head. This sounds like Avril Lavigne and Evanescence mixed together, which isn't a good thing! The grating vocals have already been described. The lyrics are generic, nu-metal tripe. Cristina Scabbia could kill this new girl in singing and songwriting. The guitar consists of power chords and no soloing. Why have 2 guitarists if they do the same thing?! The bassist might as well just quit, since you can't hear him. The drums aren't special either.All Tracks: 0/10Avoid this garbage, and get Lacuna Coil's new CD instead."	6
i have trouble getting this started on my lg optimus S but when it does open and doesnt force close it's a really well done app i have found fun and challenging. nice artwork and scenery, and very exciting when i figure out one of the clues and puzzles. i got it as free amazon app of the day download but would be willing to pay $1-2 for it. rated it down one star cuz of the trouble getting it to run. usually rebooting my phn does the trick.	1
I bought this pedal to replace one that was not working with my Yamaha Motif, simple and easy set up, just plugged it in and it worked fine, no complaints. It's great to have sustain again on my keyboard again. Well constructed pedal, a nice addition to my recording studio. This pedal works with the Yamaha Motif, that was my main concern when ordering. No other review stated that, so I figured I would mention for the next guy or gal who orders as that caused my some anxiety when ordering ( I hate returning things...LOL),	16
I personally think the Black Edition RAZR phone looks really cool, better than the regular silver version.  The phone is otherwise identical to its silver twin... but, really, it just looks so cool -- and you'll differentiate yourself from The Crowd.The phone is very capable and packed with features.  Unlike some high-end Moto phones from a year or two back, this one works very well and has a decent interface.  Everyone I know who has this phone simply loves it.[...]	7
I have the MDR-150's and these have the exact same sound quality. I have bought several different brands in various price ranges (all the way up to $100), and these are the best bang for the buck. I don't intend to use the built in volume control so hopefully the sound doesn't go out like some of the other reviewers have experienced. The only problem with these Sony's is that fake leather they put on the ear muffs.. it rubs off eventually and it will stick to your ears. Would buy these again if they last a few years.	10
it has BENZINE in it,  (and white gas as  filler)  benzine is the most powerful solvent that you can use in any injector.  A Hard fact.sure it will clean anything just about.  but do not breath it , it is a known, carcinogen.be happy it's not illegal.the cleaners that are just pale oil, are useless, and only help to poison the 02 sensors.read the MSDS, and be aware of what you bought.do not put oil in the fuel tank,  why do that. ?	2
I just purchased and used this body wash from Alba today. I bought it from Super Supplements for around $14. I figured the larger size would last me longer then the smaller bottle.The smell is very pleasant, and after showering with this product my skin is soft and not overdried. (Like with most organic products)I am a fan of Albas other products so this one was a must try, of course.My Husband wont mind using this one either, and its much better for him to use then Axe! ;)	4
The greatest FF is hands down IV. This game offers cutscenes and a story that will keep your eyes glued to the screen until you beat it. The characters are very enjoyable as well. The bosses can get a little tough, but if your a hardcore gamer, this shouldn't bother you at all. I highly recommend this game even if you are not a fan of the series. This game does take a long time to beat, but thats another positive thing this game has to offer, as do most FF games.	23
This is a particularly bad film, so if you are new to MST3K, steer clear until you get a few more episodes under your belt. Also, just so you realize the amount of pain and suffering the MST3K crew had to go through, you need to understand that they watch the movie over and over and over so they can script their riffs. You are only forced to watch it once; they are forced to watch it several times. Just thinking of watching this movie without the riffing hurts me badly.	0
The build quality could be better - ideally the nut needs to be replaced (the cut is a rush job) and the neck needs to be reset (there's a gap that indicates that the pocket wasn't completely cleaned out when it was put on) - but what do you expect for this price. It is however a playable instrument right out of the box and if you're willing to invest another $50 or so it can be a great starter guitar for a.young (smaller) player or a.nice travel instrument.	16
I recommend the large quilted multi-use pad in addition to the mattress pad.  I have about 4 of them and they are essential.  I use John Lennon receiving blankets (6 is a good number) with the quilted multi-use pad underneath to be prepared for spills and smudges on my contoured changing pad. I do the same on his crib to save me the headache of changing crib sheets which are very tedious to get off and on. It's nearly impossible to do when you've had a c-section, and not a good idea to strain yourself.	3
Let me start off by saying I have owned these for many months and have enjoyed them thoroughly. The sound quality is amazing, clear voice, nice bass and not too much that it is overpowering. To the people saying they feel cheaply made, mine went through an hour in the washer and then into the dryer and are still working as well as they did on day one. They are fairly comfortable for what they are, they fit great under a hoodie, there is an adjustment to set it to your comfort level. I highly recommend.	10
This is my favorite tool! I have abused this sander for the past 3 years and it keeps on humm'in.  It is so smooth, powerful, lightweight, and easy to handle.If your a professional woodworker like me or woodworking is your hobby this is the ONLY belt sander to have. It's the quietest belt sander I've ever used.I always recomend Bosch tools when some one wants to purchase a very powerful and high quality professional power tool. Bosch tools have never let me down.  Keep up the good work Bosch!!	21
I'm a bassist, and am familiar with the flat/round/half-round debate on BASSES (I prefer flats). Anyway, my son wanted these for his Epiphone Casino because he heard John Lennon used (a different brand of) flat-wounds. They sound AMAZING! They make that Casino ring like a carillon, yet will get &#34;down & dirty&#34; when called for. A VERY &#34;different&#34; sound range than round wounds. In fact, it's about time to order another set or three....	16
Ok, so I have a Scottish Terrier that has severe flea allergy and we have used frontlineplus for almost 4 years with no problems, and not one flea.The past few months that I have used this recent order from amazon.com she got fleas at the end of themonth.  I am assuming either I got a bad batch, or it didn't work the full month.Either way, I am scared to use frontline plus for her anymore.  She got huge sores, whelps, hairloss and it cost me 150.00 in vet bills as well as more money buying other prevention and differentshampoos for her.	19
This is the best fighting game I've ever played and best for multiple players.  There are 8 regular characters plus 4 secret ones, each with over a dozen different moves.  There are 8 regular battle arenas (themed after the 8 characters) and 1 secret one.  Starting with three basic moves and playing with another novice, you can master all of the characters and all of their moves.  This game is unfortunately rigidly divided by skill, and good players will consistently beat worse ones.  I recommend this for everyone, especially those who enjoy games that require quick descisions.	23
I have bought three different bubble wands. One smaller, it whistles, rather unimpressive in a 20 gallon long tank. I also bought the bendable, strong bubbles, not bad. But this one by far is the best, only problem it whistles as well. I have had no trouble putting it together and it creates a beautiful, thick, steady wall of bubbles. Just bought another one to replace the whistled. Bought four altogether and within two weeks all whistled. My Bettas loved them, but sanity wins in the end. I removed them.	19
"When we bought this, I thought of it as a luxury item, because you don't really need to sterilize that much, but we never use the dishwasher and I thought it would be easier and safer than boiling water.  Turns out that we were diagnosed with thrush and had to sterilize many times a day.  So glad to have had this!!! Some have complained about the ""condensation"" but this is really just the very fine mist of the boiled water on the items.  Shows it's working.. just rinse it off with water and put the items in the drying rack."	3
For Once In My Life is a very good Stevie Wonder from 1968.  As was the theme for Motown albums from the era, it contains a couple of hit singles, covers of non-Motown songs and covers of Motown songs.  &quot;For Once In My Life&quot; shows off Mr. Wonder's beautiful voice.  &quot;Shoo-Be-Doo-Be-Doo-Da-Day&quot; is fiery number that has a southern soul style and &quot;You Met Your Match&quot; is in the same vein.  Some other good songs include &quot;I Don't Know Why&quot;, &quot;God Bless The Children&quot; &amp; &quot;Do I Love Her&quot;	9
I've watched David Suchet as Hericule Poirot from the beginning; and the later versions have a different flavor then those first broadcast on PBS. I wasn't disappointed; as Suchet's performances are sublime, simply the best. One does miss Miss Lemon, Hastings and Japp, but the more things change; the more Poirot stays the same. If you are a fan of the series, I don't believe you will be disappointed in the offerings of Series 11. The downloading was a snap; and it's a treat to be able to watch without the Internet.	0
This is the final installment in this series, as far as I know.  This has Jane and her 2 masters, Antonio and Santos, escorting her to the masquerade ball.  Her ex shows up, she is part of the floor show, and much much more.  Her ex wants her back, but not for the reason you might think.  This is about another 40 pages, but the story could go further if the author decides to contiune the story.  This is the weakest in the series, but it still gets 3 stars.	14
I was asked to get some fishnets.  Im a lil above average...5'8, 190 pounds with NOT toned legs lol.  Anyhow, I figured plus size would work.  They did.  They tops do not roll down, or squeeze the fat up over them.  I wore them with garters and a garter belt.  The only thing I don't like is that they are the loose knit, not stretchy kind...so I can see them losing shape if you don't tend to them by handwashing periodically.	8
I, too, am desperately seeking a copy of this book. I read it when I was in high school, and it really turned me on to reading.  I read that book 5 or six times - it was totally dog eared and worn.  Now, 20 years later, I  still think about it... and I can't find this book anywhere.  To me,  reading this story was like stepping back in time - into a romantic and  charming and exciting time... I really wish the publisher would re print  this book!  I would love to have my daughters read it now.	5
This would be a 5 out of 5 if only they hadn't mislabeled it as powder. This is definitely granulated. But aside from that it's a good low calorie sweetener. It doesn't have the same... um, gastrointestinal side effects as other sugar alcohols which is great. But if you're looking for a substitute for powdered sugar in recipes, know that you are going to have to take this and run it through a magic bullet or a coffee grinder or something. I used a magic bullet and made sugar free royal icing and it was great.	11
"I didn't expect too much for an inexpensive canister vacuum.  I was purchasing to vacuum cat and dog hair on my carpeted stairs and to vacuum my car.  This little ""mighty mite"" packs a big punch.  Superb suction, compact and light weight, but does not feel flimsy.  When researching this purchase I found the other customer reviews helpful, and I also found other references to this model as being one of the better canister compacts.  Would recommend to anyone looking for a canister vacuum."	13
I simply don't understand the fanfare.  Every bit of this story was heartbreaking.  The animal abuse (especially Rosie), the human abuse (Walter and Camel, especially), and all of the heartbreaking things that happened at the hands of certain men.  What was there to enjoy about this story?  Revenge at the end?  Ok, so I liked the last 3 pages.  But those last 3 pages didn't make up for my sadness throughout the whole of this book.  I wish I hadn't read it.	5
This headset is a replacement for a logitec I had used for years.  It is my second bluetooth and the fit is great.  It does not hurt the ear and stays in place very well.The noise canceling is not on par with the logitec, but I added a wind sock and it resolved most of the challenges.The audio is not as good as I would like and the controls are confusing to me.  I think the former because my current phone is a 1.1 and the latter because I am use to the logitec.All in all a good value for the price.	7
This season is not as good as other seasons, but it's still alright. One of my favorite episodes is when it's HALLOWEEN and Satan is throwing a big Sweet Sixteen party and acts like a spoiled rich teenager. Also Stan, Kyle, Cartman, and Kenny deal with the death of their friend Chef, stop Manbearpig, try to get a Family Guy episode pulled, defeat a nerdy gamer on World of Warcraft, and stop Ike from having sexual relations with his smokin' hot teacher. (Nice!) All this and more happen in SOUTH PARK: THE COMPLETE 10TH SEASON!!!	0
These are thick and well-made, and provide smooth application of wax on your car.  On the down side--because they are so thick, they absorb a lot of wax that just ends up being washed out of the pad after use.  Also, I did soak the pad overnight because it was a little dirty after using it all over my car.  It still hasn't cleaned out all of the dirt and excess wax.  I'll see how it looks after washing it in my washing machine.	2
As far as text adventures go - this is pretty frustrating. If it's complicated puzzles don't get you, the random holes that seem to appear in dark areas will. Or better yet, try getting out of the labyrinth while keeping your sanity. Maybe you should take the game's advice - or wait, don't because usually it doesn't work. What's worse is that it actually retorts when you finally tell it to **** off. Strange, difficult, and taunts the player. Decide for yourself if its your thing or not.	1
This was a good novella to introduce readers to the Angels series. However, it's not necessary to read this before reading Angel's Blood. The plot and pacing were good, and the character development was great. The tension between the hero and heroine was one of the best aspects of the story. Due to the short word count, the storyline and backstory didn't have as much time to develop as I would've liked. I think  I may enjoy it better as a reread since I've finished Angel's Blood now and understand more of the backstory. Overall, a good read.	14
I wanted to try out the boxer briefs since I was starting to get tired of the issues related to boxers alone.  I got these and another brand on here and man did that change my way of thinking.  I love these boxer briefs.  They are comfortable, plenty of support, and look good too!  I bought 3 more pairs just 1 week after wearing these.  I highly recommend these.  I will probably buy some more so that I have a pair for each day of the week!	8
Item: Double Extend MascaraBrand: L'Oreal9 times out of 10 L'Oreal makes a smash hit product I would use over and over again, this is an item in the 1 out of 10.

I use it all the time.  I use it to basically flood my engine via the intake/vacuum line.  I let it suck up about 2/3 of the bottle slowly without it killing the engine and then last 1/3rd I just push the vacuum line completely in the bottle and let the engine die essentially.  Then I let it sit anywhere from 30mins to overnight.  Next time you start the car, it will be smoking white smoke (as it burns off all the carbon build up that it helped dissolve) for maybe 5-10mins.  I do this about ever 6mo or so.	2
As others have noted, there is only a small amount of velcro to hold.Also, I like the type of ties that you can wrap first around the cable (so you don't lose the tie) and then around the bundle.With the way these work, you can't do that.If you want ties in different colors and you won't be using them much (e.g. wrapping up a cable and storing it in a drawer until you need it) then these might be ok..but for the road warrior trying to keep all his cables organized, pick something else.	10
Ok so i get the idea that you are a glove rolling on a ball. Hmmmm. Ok well here goes. If you liked this game, you are an IDIOT! HELLO GUYS YOU ARE A GLOVE! WHAT THE HECK IVE NEVER HEARD OF SUCH AN IDIOTIC CHARACTER! A GLOVE! FOR GOODNESS SAKES, IVE HEARD THAT ORIGINALITY IS GOOD, BUT THIS? ok i will stop yelling. But jeeze guys cant you see that only some kind of fool would actually enjoy playing as a glove that can balance on a ball? Well I can. So I'm out, enough said.	23
"This product is easy to use, and effectively repels vermin from my plants.The battery-powered sprayer includes four AA batteries required for operation. It has a three foot tube that extends from the lid, and I am able to hold the jug comfortably during application. The instructions mention a fine mist wand, but I didn't see one, but the main, twisting nozzle adjusts from stream to spray.The ""natural"" ingredients are clearly listed; however, these only make up 4.632% of the total solution. There are 95.368% of other undisclosed ingredients."	18
Easy to clean.The &#34;lip&#34; at the front pretty much prevents boys from making a huge mess while on the potty, but there are not any rough edges to catch skin.Easy to take the &#34;bowl&#34; off to pour the contents in the toilet.  Even my 2 (almost 3) year old can easily pour in toilet without too many spills.I like the back and the arm rests on the sides. Makes it comfortable for the child, especially when we initially began using the potty.	3
One thing I didn't understand when I registered for this online is that it's huge! We lived in a small one-bathroom condo when I had my first baby and it was difficult to find a place for this thing since we had to take it out of the tub every time we showered.If you have a bathroom that's just for the baby where you can leave the tub in there all the time, this tub is perfect. If, however, you bathe your baby in your own bathroom, consider getting the Sure Comfort tub that's smaller.	3
Bought for 24 month old, 35 lb, rough and tumble grandson. Took Grandpa about 1/2 hour to assemble. He's pretty good at this stuff. Grandson quickly figured out how to coast car down the slight incline of our driveway.It hit the gutter with such force I winced. He wasn't scared at all. In fact he laughed and did it over and over. I was concerned car might topple over, but it never did. It is remarkably stable. It is also light weight for it's size. This makes it easy to move it around the house/garage.  Hands down his favorite toy.	22
We love this gate, it is so easy to install.  I just got rid of our superyard gate.  That was not very good to use because you have to climb in and out of the gate.  If you have an active child like mine, you will have to go in and out a lot.  Several times i trip over it and it's not fun when you bang your legs into the gate.  It is plastic but still it hurts!  Since we just change to this hands free gate, we are so relieved.  It's worth every penny!	3
I loved the mini-series so decided to give the book a go.  The TV series covered all the most important things from the book, but as usual there is much detail in the book that there was not time for in the series. This book is a good bet for  anyone who loves an engrossing story about a very important time in the history of mankind.  I learned a great deal that I never knew before, and I fancy myself somewhat of a history buff.  Highly recommended.	5
"I have 4 Penguin Bio-wheels running on 3 tanks, so I figured that I'd save a bit of extra cash by using walmart brand aqua-clear filters on the Penguins; since they look identical. Boy, was that a mistake. They may look the same, but in the Penguin filters they use ""black diamond"" activated carbon, which is worlds different from aqua-clear. You can really tell by the water quality.I will purchase these all the time now, as it's the best price around!"	19
I thought Sneaker Pimps really had something going when I first heard &quot;6 Underground&quot;, but then when I heard the rest of the CD, I was very glad that I didn't buy the CD and just heard someone else's copy of it.  The songs are nothing like &quot;6 Underground&quot; and are lacking in both originality and artistic talent.  Not a good buy.  If you bought the CD, then you probably find yourself skipping through the entire CD and listening to the last song which was a remix by another artist.  The original is almost terrifying.  The rest of the CD is just garbage.	9
"Crisis being Oldfield's 1983 release and his 8th album and contains the well known track ""Moonlight Shadow"" which is such a great track. Other great tracks are ""Shadow on the Wall"", and ""In High Places"". The main track sounds like a bit like Jean Michel Jarre and Kraftwerk and is very experimental. We get some great linernotes but no lyrics but a list of whom plays what on each track. The cover is quite odd but I like the photo of Oldfield in the booklet. 4/5."	9
I've used many different slings over the years. Some of them prettier than this one, but none as practical. I love how well it grips your shoulder, no more slipping around as you're hiking. The plastic swivels are fantastic. I was at first skeptical of the durability of plastic swivels, but soon realized that they are well made and will not damage your stock or squeak like the metal ones sometimes can. This is the only one I'll buy in the future. I have  black one.	20
C'est un film qui a mal vieilli. Rien &agrave; dire au sujet de l'interpr&eacute;tation, mais le d&eacute;cor comme les situations sont poussi&eacute;reux et, malheureusement, l'intrigue n'apporte aucune surprise : on sait d&egrave;s le d&eacute;but que tout finira par s'arranger et que la pauvre h&eacute;rone sera sauv&eacute;e in-extremis.Le plaisir vient tout de mme de cet effet r&eacute;tro, de ce faux suspense qui finit par amuser, et qui pousse le spectateur a rester jusqu'au g&eacute;n&eacute;rique final, en se disant qu'il pourra s'endormir ensuite  tranquillement sans faire de cauchemars.	15
I originally used another app that wasn't as nice as this one; I'm glad I stumbled upon this.  This app is easy to use and great to keep track of what you're consuming on a daily basis.  I recommend it all the time.  So much better than an actual food journal, you can look up most foods or the individual parts of what you're eating to calculate the calories.  Also tracks exercise and water.  It syncs well on my phone and kindle fire.	1
"This works great for dashboards, plastic interiors and black outside trim.  However it streaks on tire rubber and doesn't darken tires as much s other products. I do recommend it for trim and interiors only.  I followed directions and left the spray on the tires for a full 5 minutes before wiping.  It's water based so that is probably the reason it doesn't work well on tires.  I believe it does help to PROTECT tire rubber, it just doesn't give it the ""Wet"" look."	20
When I first heard this cd I was blown away. I love everything on it  except the Doors cover. The beats are fresh. The bass is thick. The layers  are perfect. Tracy Thorn has become one of my favorite singers because of  this record. It really made me re-evaluate where my music was going. In a  time when people swore grunge was the future of music these cats were  playing it ultra cool. In the question of 5 cd's I would take if stuck on a  desert island this would make the cut without thinking.	9
The Filter-Max III Pre Filter was a great buy. I use it as a pre filter on my Aqueon HOB filter. The Filter-Max helps keep the filter clean and allows me to extent the period of time between filter rinses and cartridge changes. This in turn really lets the biological filtration establish itself both in the filter and on the sponge.I like the Filter-Max so much that I have purchased another for my Penguin 200...the only challenge with that will be matching the round pre filter to the rectangular intake on the HOB filter...but I will figure it out!	19
i think metal gear solid was THEE greatest video game ever and so i had to have this addition.  i was a little disappointed.  some of the msssions are a little drab.  the really good ones, where you play the ninja, do not happen till late in the game and so the fun is short lived.  some of the missions are so basic that i blew through them in no time and others so boring that i could finish them in my sleep.  this was not awful but not great and that leaves you with three stars	23
I've had 3 headsets already, and each one had something about it that I didn't like. I hesitated to buy this one, despite the great reviews, because I wanted one that didn't give me the 'telemarketer' look. Top things I was looking for were: sound quality, comfort, and battery life. This unit delivers on all 3 counts. It sounds fantastic, it's really comfortable (especially with the Jabra EarGels on the ear piece), and the battery lasts a long time. Looking back, this is the one that I should have bought in the first place. Recommended.	7
Bought these after reading multiple excellent reviews.  I work outside and CONSTANTLY have chapped and cracked lips, that peel and bleed.  Chapstick, Carmex, etc...  work for me, but not for long.  Seems like I'm continually applying the balm. So, I hunted and hunted and hunted for the BEST, and came upon Natural Ice.  A few months of using the product, I'm hooked.  The balm seems to stay on my lips longer than other brands, not needing reapplication every few minutes.  My lips are definitely less chapped and painful.	12
"I drive a convertible and I have gone through 6 different hands-free devices that didn't work. Wind noise is awfully high with the top down, and my wife could never hear me when I talked on a hands-free. That is no longer a problem. The Shure works great! It is comfortable, clear sounding and best of all - I'm audible when I speak. If it had a ""turbo"" button, it would be perfect, but other than that - it is terrific. This is the best I've seen..."	7
This is 200 sheets of wide rules filler paper,  It has three holes punched for your binder.  The lines don't fade or smudge as some lesser filler papers are prone to do.  It is crisp, clean, white, smudgeproof, and looks and performs like the best papers in the world, at a reasonable price.  I like to get 200 sheets in a package as this is a generous size but not so much that I have to store a lot of excess paper on a shelf where it can get dusty.  Mead makes great office supplies from the ones I've been seeing lately.	17
Girls this book is hot and sexy. After reading and laughing at some of the reviews, I really am stumped for what more to say about this book. Chick-lit this book is not, but from a chick-porn perspective it is pretty good! This book is short but that is a good thing. I don't need drama with my chick-porn. Marie Harte gives you just enough to be vested in the characters of this book without dragging out the story and a fine job of it! Check out Derricks story by this author, it is good too.	14
The other reviews of this product are accurate and fair. This is a great level. It's nice enough that you'll have it for years and years. Granted, it is nicer than the $7 cheapie at home depot, but it's much more precise (the viscosity of the fluid is much lower so it's very touchy) and it's much sturdier. The base is ground flat and the magnets are strong. I highly recommend it as an all-purpose level for hanging pictures, tool setup, framing, etc.	21
I bought this for my 4-wheeler. I have a K&N filter on my truck and it has performed real well. Just take an air hose and clean it instead of buying another one. I'm hoping to get the same service out of this one too. Every-time I have my 4-wheeler service, they change my air filter. Well.........those little filters are fairly expensive. I figure I can save a little over some time as far as the filter is concerned.........plus K&N has a pretty good reputation. I would recommend this to anyone wanting such an item.	2
My sandals will sometimes rub blisters.  I don't like to wear bandaids or corn cushions, too freaking obvious.  This band aid blister cushions are pretty close to perfect.  They are flesh toned, (if you are beige colored, any darker skinned and they will be obvious.  Makes me wonder, why don't they make these in different skin tones?  Sounds like a great idea to me) and they protect the spots on your feet that are blister prone.  I use a ton of these and buy them often.  Highly, highly recommend.	12
"Purchased as part of the home care package this little blower is great for loose material on hard or semi hard surfaces. While it doesn't have the power of my 230 mph corded one, there is one application where it shines.Even on a low setting the ""high power"" blower will always blow mulch off the beds when trying to clean out leaves and grass from among the scrubs. Getting the cord through all the shrubs is no picnic either.Provided it's dry, this little guy gets in between the bush's, shrubs, plants without blowing all the bedding into the yard, saving a few hours of raking."	18
I don't know why I bought this, even after reading the other reviews.  The logic of the quick disconnect to move from machine to machine seemed cost justified.  However, the product will disconnect while in use, and even disconnect if not perfectly flat.Rather than use this product, avoid, avoid, avoid.  Set your dust collection system up with &quot;Y&quot; or &quot;T&quot; fittings to each machine with blast gates to control the air flow.  This hard wired system, even though it cost more, will be much better system to operate and use without hassles.	21
I've got some big redwood trees in my backyard and every year my squirrel population seems to grow.  They run around my yard eating flowers, digging up my grass (I used to think it was gophers), fighting with each other and creating a racket.Anyway, I figured I'd give this Havahart repellent a try.  I sprayed it around my yard.  It works, less squirrel activity around my yard.  They're either sticking to the redwood trees or moved on to my neighbor's house.So it was worth it for me, 5-stars.	18
An excellent ensemble cast.  Damien Lewis is magnificent.  When this became available through Amazon Prime, I rabidly devoured an episode...and then another...and then all of a sudden, Season 1 was over and I wondered at how deeply engrossed I became in Charlie's story and how much I had grown to care about him and his partner, Danni.  So now I was craving to know even more of Charlie Crews, et al. An excellent ensemble cast.  Damien Lewis is magnificent.  Now it on to season two.	0
This game is pretty simple to learn.  The idea is to make 'runs' by matching colors or shapes.  Scoring varies based on the tiles you place in a single play and if you are able to complete a series.  My daughters enjoying playing it, especially my 8 year old.  I find the game a little on the simple side for adults but it is much more enjoyable to play over Candyland and other child targeted board games.  This game is a great family game.  Add another game like Sequence and you have the makings for an enjoyable family game night.	22
Romans on the defensive from the Picts, trapped and trying to get back home. A lot of battle/fight scenes. Guts, blood, beheading, hacking, squirting blood, etc. Backstabbing, and not just with weapons. A fierce female warrior and a lovestory thrown in for good measure.Michael Fassbender is excellent. Liam Cunningham, not listed anywhere as being in this movie, is a main character and also goes a great job. Overall, the acting is pretty good.Between 3 and 4 stars. Good to watch if you have nothing else to do.	0
Others have reviewed the store line much more in depth and better than I can here. I loved this book. Once I started reading it, I didn't put it down. This is not a silly little beach read as it has been touted. It is more in depth than that.The characters were believable. They didn't do anything that was totally out of character once their basic personality was developed. The setting was realistic and interesting and a vital part of the story. The ending was surprising.Very well written. Very interesting. Worth the time to read and worth the money.Enjoy.	5
Well, it's a good little bluetooth for the money.. I've only had a couple times when it's cut out on me and not worked right, but 3/4 of the time it works beautifully and people don't even know I'm on it! I think the times that I did cut out was because I was too close to metallic objects.. pipes and things.. so.. that sounds like a good excuse..eh?Works good for me, and is cute and small, fits like a dream, good battery life.. all in all is a good bluetooth.	7
So this thing is so much better than the alternatives.  Sure it's pricier, but in this case you get what you pay for. It works perfectly, and it makes handling 100 feet of heavy cord a snap.  The design is very clever, the build quality is top notch, and it just does exactly what you want it to -- managing a long heavy cord is no longer something to dread at the end of a long day.  Can't recommend it highly enough.  Beats out other options by a huge margin	21
I have worn this bra for many years.  Had trouble finding it and then... of course... found it here on Amazon. (LOVE Amazon)The cups are now almost 'bullet shaped'.  I feel like I should be back in the 50's or in a Madonna video.  It is very strange.  Nothing like before.  That being said... it is still very comfortable and they did eliminate the tag by stamping the label inside the back strap... which I like.  But the cup shape is so strange that I will not buy again.	8
What can I say about these gloves. They fit well, look great ( I have the tan set ) I got the idea watching Tony Curtis wear driving gloves in his series &#34; The Persuaders&#34;.  I would never buy anything else. Normally I have a large size but ordered the medium and they ,can I say it, fit like a glove. Only blemish was  a slight stain on the right glove,but was so happy with them,I kept the set and plan on ordering another pair.	8
Put on a 29 gal. aquarium. When turned to low flow it is perfect. Like the option of being able to turn it to high flow for a fast clean when necessary. It is super quite and contrary to other reviews the lid does not rattle. Make sure you level it with a small level. Its a new tank so I replaced the carbon with an ammonia- nitrate remover. You don't need the carbon unless you need to remove medicine from your tank. Replaced an Aqua Tech 30-40 which does not have near the filtering capabilities of the Aqua-Clear.	19
I am always on the look out for a cutter that will last.  When this cutter arrived and I opened the box, I found a cutter that was plastic....How long?  I also found that in use, the cutter has not enough weight to hold strong.  And you need to apply pressure so that it can cut....again  How long can this last.I believe that if you are going to use this on occasion and not for heavy duty scrap-booking I might want to consider theunit is mostly plastic and light weight.Could only give 3 stars for this product.	17
I replaced the strings on my electric and tuned it. . . once.normally, after tuning new strings for the first time, I break them in by rigorously bending them, using the whammy bar and tugging on them then I re-tune them. I rinse and repeat until the tuning stays. not with these strings. tuned them once, no breaking in.it sounds amazing on clean; on its own without any effects, and the natural sustain is great. they also sound good with any settings I use.i bought two sets.	16
I have to pump milk for my daughter at my office, and getting my pump parts clean was challenging.  Our sink doesn't put out enough got water for me to feel that my parts were really clean and safe.  Now, I wash the parts and then put them through a steam sterilization in the office microwave, and I pump with the confidence that I'm not adding harmful bacteria to my breastmilk.  It also serves as a nice place to store my pump parts at the office, where I know they will remain clean and untouched.	3
First I want to thank all the Weber owners who reviewed here.  This cover is fantastic.As others have alluded, the Weber covers are what best can be described as an afterthought.These Veranda covers are the exact opposite - High quality materials, high quality workmanship, functional design, attractive and durable.The only negative is that the large size (64in) is about 2 inches shorter than the OEM Summit series 400 cover.  Otherwise, it's perfect and I expect it to last as long as multiple Weber covers.  Happy grilling!	18
The ultimate spatula. I have ordered several in this series, but this is the first that I have used. It is great. Even for non coated pots/pans, this utensil can get down to the fire and come out like new. A very impressive tool. It follows the contour of your pan without trying to scrape through to the burner, and makes it to the dishwasher unscathed. There are a few things that a steel spatula are needed for, but this gem will handle the rest of the tasks, while keeping all of your cookware looking like new.	13
I was pleasantly surprised by this story.  Granted, it had wonderful reviews here on Amazon, but there have been other popular fiction novels with the same reviews, and I loathed those books.I don't need to go into any details as the book has been so thoroughly reviewed, but I will say there was so much in the book that touched me.  Ninety or ninety-three year old Jacob's story was so emotional...it's going to stay with me for quite awhile.  Bravo!	5
"Kill The Storyis a very good mystery. Plot was highly original and will appeal especially to those who disapprove of the invasiveness of reporters (though the revenge in this case is harsher than deserved). Pacing was good, and kept me reading. Progress of the investigation was credible. Characters were interesting and intelligent. Ending is a nail-biter and highly satisfying.Two negatives in my opinion: some gratuitous cursing; also I've read mysteries that are slightly more uniformly gripping, though I'd put this one in the top quartile for ""grippingness"".Very entertaining. At $2 it was a great deal, too. I highly recommend it."	14
Fits my S&W 686 (6 shot) perfectly.  When snapped, it's nice that the thumb loop acts to prevent the hammer from being pulled back, making it an idea holster for both wear and travel.  The color doesn't really match what's in the picture, but it's not orange.  That's just an over-exaggeration.  Leather is a good quality and there are two slits in the back loop that allow the holster to fit on both a wide belt and a regular (everyday) belt.	20
Running 3 to 5 pedals on my board, this was a logical choice of power. The single transformer running into the board with the multi-plug was easy to set up and the small profile of the plugs, combined with the thin cables makes for a neat and uncluttered board. There is no lin drop of power and the devices are able to draw the current needed to work at their peak. Further, with the transformer being well away from the board, there is zero AC hum. What's not to like here?	16
i may be a metalhead, but i know that Jesus died for my sins and He comes first in my life before any metal band does. this movie is awesome, but there are a few things that don't happen in the Holy Bible, like satan carrying around a baby, Judas Iscariot being tormented by a bunch of kids,and one of the criminals getting pecked in the head by a crow. if this movie moved you to accept Jesus as your Savior, remember these three things: Jesus died, Jesus rose, and Jesus is coming again.	15
I loved Brody and Hayden's story. It was passionate, funny and dramatic. The storyline was great. A well written story is something that is important to me. And this story was very well written. When Hayden approached Brody I'm sure she had no idea what she was getting into. I loved the part when they found out exactly who each other were. I also loved the bridge jokes. It kept me laughing. Who says you can't have it all, A loving man who is also a hottie and a bad boy.This is most definitely in my re-read pile.	14
"A former Pentagon strategic weapons planner, a brilliant nuclear physicist, a social worker from Penn Valley, a poet, and a nut, combine to blackmail the US government. So far so good. Demanding uni-lateral dis-armament, our anti-heroes claim to have a nuclear bomb aboard the tugboat Liberty May... ..""..and if our demands are not met, by 4:30 tomorrow afternoon...this bomb will detonate...and we will all know ...fear.."".  Powerhouse cast and bristling dialogue.  This realistic fake newscast can be seen as a tense drama, dark comedy, satire, and/or propaganda. (Pokes fun at the FBI too!) A must see!"	6
Even though I'd seen this tool discussed in many places and had even seen an in-store demo setup for it, I really didn't understand just how cool this thing was until I got it and used it to setup the very first deck board on my project (the first one really has to be straight, since everything transfers off it...).  This tool made pushing the bow out of that board a breeze, especially since I only have my two hands to work with.  Well worth the price, IMHO.	21
I bought this bluetooth after using another model of Plantronics bluetooth to death. I liked it a lot but it was a little bulky so I went for a slimmer model this time; the Explorer 330. FORGET IT! It won't stay in my ear. It makes my ear so sore that I can hardly force myself to wear it (I have to have it for my job) and if I get four feet away from my cell, I get static. I'm VERY disappointed with this model and will be returning it.	7
I got one book, for free from my libary (# 3) so at that time I did not even realize these were a series.  But I really enjoyed that one so I went back to start at the beginning with this book.  I don't think you have to read them in order, there is enough information that I did not feel lost reading them out of order.  I really liked the story of this first book, the characters were very endearing in my opinion. I hope this helps someone else enjoy a good series.	14
I have tried all the curris from Mae Ploy (excluding the Panag) and various other curry pastes out there. Mae Play is a solid and affordable curry paste that keeps. The Red has more heat, but the green has more spice. The Yellow and Matsaman curry paste don't really have any heat to me, but do taste good as well.For a holiday treat, substitute eggnog for coconut milk with the green curry. It is super delicious (just be advised your GI tract WILL hate you later for doing so)	11
I purchased this bottle warmer for my second baby because it was a life saver for my daughter.  It stores 2 bottles in the compartment and comes with a small ice pack.  Do not store milk with this ice pack for more than eight hours.  The pack is fairly small and does not cool the milk for long.  I use a freezer pack and store one bottle at a time.  I would add a time chart just to know approximately how much time it takes to heat up a bottle.	3
I got 2 of these at my baby shower (one for upstairs and one for downstairs) and I absolutely love them! They steam pretty quick and I like how you can keep pre-measured water on it. When baby's hungry I just grab the bottle from the fridge, grab the little flask of water that's attached, pour it in, and press the button. I've had to warm bottles twice sometimes but it's still faster than warming water on the stove or running the bottle under the faucet. Oh, I only do 2 oz. bottles for now.	3
This was the first and last Robinson book I read. Too many geographical details- the characters were unsympathetic and the story line lacked creativity. I guess I should have read one of the other colored Mars first. However, I thank Robinson from sparing me from the desire to read any more of them- my time on Earth is limited. If I were you, your time on Mars should be limited, too. This was also the last science fiction genre that I read- it made me realize that it's not for me, and for that, I also thank the author.	5
These are the exact ones that I was looking for but there is one problem.  They are supposed to be clear but they arrived yellowed in the package.  It is obvious that they are new, but they have yellowed and are no longer clear.  I bought these to replace existing ones that I have that have yellowed but not to the extent of these new ones.  I have had the previous ones since 2010.  I will keep as spares but am unhappy with the condition of these EarGels.	7
This is my first time reading this author and all in all this is not a bad book. I finished it in a few hours. It really grabbed and held my interest in a Murder She Wrote/Matlock kind of way.  When I began reading it couldn't help but chuckle at the way the author introduces Jimmy. Lol.In my opinion, it is a nice mix of humour, murder/mystery and romance. Some aspects of the romance are a little ummm weird...but who am I to judge? :-)	14
I'm a fan of this author.  My son loves his werewolf series.  I was pleasantly surprised to read a love story written by a man and it be so clean and pure.  I really felt all the characters were believable and felt their emotions.  There is an unexpected twist in this story that I found original to this type of story.  It's a brilliant move by this author and  makes me want to read even more of his work.  If you love a good faith-based, clean romance, pick this one up.	14
Best boot that you can  buy for the money.  I have boots that I paid twice as much that are not as good. This is my second pair. My older pair was beginning to show their age. Only thing negative - I can't wear until my sore toe heals up. They are pretty stiff in toe area. I cleaned up my old broke-in pair and will have to wear the new ones  at a later date. I might try taking a block of wood and soften up the toe.	8
It does what it is suppose to, cut vibration and well I might add. Much better than a standard clip on a mic. This one is not going to break if you take the mic on and off, since it's rubber. If it does break, has a lifetime warranty. Had a Shure SM58 on a table, on a stand in this clip, pounded on the table, only picked up the tap sound my hand has making, and no sub harmonics vibrating though the table. Moved the mic off axis, pounded again, absolutely no noise. Can't ask for more than that.	16
"Having been an Easy Spirit fan for many years, I'm always looking for less-than-full price shoes.  These ""Motion"" have been a consistently good buy, a great value shoe that holds up well, comfortable, polishes like new, and never separates at the seams.  I wear the newest ones for outings, the older ones for around the house, the oldest ones for the garden.  But I always watch for when they go for less than full price....because I know I will get great, consistent shoes."	8
The suction on this little machine is unreal.  Sure, the parts are made of plastic and with careless throwing around, parts will break.  But if you are careful and don't step on the hose, you'll find this is a gem.  I have no carpets; just 2 throw rugs with non-rubber backing.  The 'carpet' feature totally cleans these rugs.  The floor feature is just what I need for my 2 floors of hardwood.  And the price?  OMG, if it quits in 2 years, I will have gotten my money's worth.	13
Although pricey, I am impressed by the quality and sturdiness of this organizer. The color is attractive, it's designed to fit inside a 5-gallon bucket, but one the workbench, it doesn't tip even when loaded. I use it to keep various small liquids, such as oils, glue, Loctite, and grease tubes. Its depth allows it to hold scissors, screwdrivers, safety glasses, pliers, wirecutters, or anything needed at hand. Along with theBucket Boss Extreme Fatback Bucket Organizer, they make a great gift for your handyman.	21
"Take Note:  This product is not ""food grade"" diatomacious earth (which is what I want and searched for on Amazon), does not state that it is safe for use near pets and children, and does state that it includes a bait ingredient -- obviously it is not intended for human or pet consumption.This is not the one best suited for my uses, but should be perfectly effective, and in a handy applicator-topped bottle, for anyone using it in the absence of precious mammals/critters."	18
I've only had this vacuum for 2 months but it's everything the other reviews said it was.  It's light and easy to maneuver.  I have two long hair cats and it has no problem with all of the shedding.  I like the carpet level adjustment so I can do the bare floor as well as the carpet (for thorough cleaning I use a small wand vacuum for the bare floors).  Assembly is a cinch, took me under 1/2 hour.  Returned my Oreck in favor of this one.	13
This game is great, and it is a great game overall in order for LucasArts to strike back at Eidos's Tomb Raider for trying to take away Indy's title of the greatest adventure dude out there.  The game is one of the best I  have played, but if you do the wrong thing, the game crashes.  MOST of  these problems can be fixed by downloading patches at lucasarts.com, but I  really hate the hassle this causes.  Make sure you know how to get a patch  if you get this game.	23
I just love these old mysteries and Freeman's are not as slow moving nor as  lugubrious and verbose as others. For myself, I find they are an easy read; that is, beautifully written, engaging and enjoyable.I especially liked the short stories and Helen Vardon and did not find the typos to be onerous, not finding above half a dozen in the last full-length novel. I am definitely going to be acquiring more of this author's work.  Thank you Amazon for making these pieces available and at such reasonable prices. In fact, many are free!!	14
"This is for all of us who grew up in the 60s-70s era & yearn for the ""good old days"". This was when the Love Generation was in full flower, pun intended. It is a faithful rendition of that period. The best moment in the whole thing is watching Cass Elliot being blown away by Janis sitting in the first row & wowing a no-holds-barred blues classic. No one had really known of this small town Texas woman who was a one-off original & who was larger than life, & created her own Rock Opera on stage & off."	6
My mom said to get enough crib sheets because it was something you had to change constantly.... I now have a drawer full of crib sheets that have never been used!  This is the best thing ever!  we put one on, and have the other one for an emergency.  It is soft, the cotton is excellent quality and the work of crib changing at 3 in the morning it just went from 10 minutes to 1 minute! nothing can bit 9 minutes of extra sleep in the middle of the night	3
"It's funny to me that this Victorinox Swiss Army Classic Pocket Knife is actually labeled a ""knife.""  Like other Swiss army knives, there are multiple functions.  I've used the scissors more than anything, but the single slim knife blade does come in handy.  Unless the TSA takes it away,  eventually the spring for the scissors will eventually break, and you'll lose the toothpick, the tweezers, or both.  Then, perhaps, it's time for a replacement.  Until then, however, you have a fabulous mini utility tool to help you with your life functions!"	20
This mouse pad works great with my optical mouse. It isn't thick and bulky nor is it a slippery vinyl pad. It's the perfect size to sit next to my keyboard along with my bead-filled wrist cushion. It is a COMFORTABLE mouse pad covered with a soft  polyester fabric attached to a non-skid sponge rubber base. The texture provides good control for my mouse. For me, it's the perfect mouse pad, it's a nice color, and the price is right, too!	17
This is a weird sort of &#34;goo&#34; that comes out malleable like fairly hard putty. It can be molded, but it's a little too hard to mold to the gums well enough. I left it in for a few days and it was VERY hard to remove! It seems to have a slightly glue-like consistency. I can see it being perhaps useful in &#34;fine-tuning&#34; a temporary reline kit, but DON'T confuse it with actual denture adhesive. It doesn't stick to the gums AT ALL.	12
This is well made and sturdy but I just don't find myself using it because it's so heavy to carry to the garden - especially if you're carrying tools as well.  Instead I usually end up taking along a light plastic low one-step stool from the dollar store.  It's true I do struggle getting up at times without those nice handles to push against but I don't have to lug the heavy thing around and for me that's more of a chore. It just doesn't feel comfortable either - the seat is too high and the kneeler too low and neither is very soft.	18
This book is almost as if Kahlil Gibran took the pains and joys of millions of people and somehow managed to encapsulate all these wonders in this one book.  In his own unique manner, Gibran has explored every facet  of human existence.  Although the book has a sacred charm to it, there is a  universal appeal that should allow anyone of any religious persuassion  enjoy this gem of a book. I wouldn't be surprised if a few hundred years  from now some theologians unearth this book and conclude that it was a  bible of our times.	5
We have a Cozy Coupe at home and one at Grandma's too. It's a durable little car that's fun and cute. Initially, it's hard to get it out of reverse, but once the little ones figure it out, they'll cruise all over. It's one of the cheaper ride-ons out there, but it's well worth the money. This is one of those toys that will last for years and your kids will play with for years.10 years later, our Cozy Coupe is still in great condition and providing hours of fun for a younger sister.	22
This is a great system and was very sad to see that Sega is no longer going to make systems. But have fun with this system while you still can!!!! There really cheap ...and have a slew of great titles like: Shenmue, Sonic Adventure, House of the Dead, and many many others. I recommened this even though there are more superior systems. I dont think the online game play is still active but the actual system is awesome!! Please buy and enjoy this system!!!!!!	23
Recently my 2003 Explorer had been acting up symptoms included:- hard shifting- a sudden drop in RPMMy mechanic told me to buy Lucas Tranmission fix. To be honest I was skeptical at first from my experience additives are just wallet stealers. They advertise their product and give a magic fix. So I gave it a try and BAAMM!. I test drove my Explorer and noticed a huge difference. My shifting was smooth and better since when I purchased it.Before you go and blow out a large sum of money on a new transmission give Lucas Transmission Fix a shot. !	2
I've been looking around for an apple corer (and hopefully cheaper than Pampered Chef) and stumbled upon this one.  AWESOME bargain!  My kids have enjoyed apple ring snacks (smeared with peanut butter and sprinkled with granola) and baked apples with brown sugar!  My son has a habit of munching the apple through the core, but will not eat an apple that has been cut up.  This corer has been the perfect solution, as I can keep it in tact and remove the core for him.  Very sturdy, easy to use and a steal for the price!	13
I have always used the Pet Mate water fountains for my pets.  When one of their last ones wore out, I bought one of these AspenPet Cool Flow Pet Fountains.  It wasn't near as quiet as the Pet Mate ones I was was used to.  I put a thick plush throw rug under it and that helped a lot.  It does have a powerful filter system on it.  To reduce the sound, I changed the filter to a filter that is a slight bit thinner and that did help too.	19
I have the Hoover Windtunnel Max vacuum cleaner and these belts fit. Buy them in advance, because my vacuum cleaner picked up a blanket and I pulled it out when the vacuum cleaner was still on. You are supposed to turn off the vacuum cleaner, then pull out the blanket. Well, that was one of the first times I vacuumed with my Hoover and it ruined the belt, and I needed a replacement right there on the spot. I had one, because I went and bought this 2-pack along with my Hoover. A good practice.	13
"Not sure why this product states a gatemouth or ridgid bottom; the product I received has none of these features.  The picture is accurate of what I received; however, the description, and the majority of the reviews here are describing a previous/alternative version of this bag.  A simple web search will reveal a photo of the actual ""gatemouth"" product (with a hinged top), but i can't seem to find any venders on line offering that version of the bag.  This is still decent bag, but probably not worth the $30 price tag.  I'll most likely RMA this product.  Bummed ..."	21
Curious George has been a classic for years, however, I believe that the Curious George show is better than ever.  There is always a lesson hidden in these adorable episodes.  My son LOVES to watch it, and I am happy to let him watch.  They discuss topics from counting to instruments, colors, nature etc.  The graphics are wonderful and sharp, music is so cute!  I truly find myself singing the opening song with him&#8230;always! It is nice for our children to have shows that are fun, as well as educational.	0
I generally enjoy strong flavors but this spice mix ruined a seafood lasagna I made a few months ago. Perhaps it would be OK on chicken, but the lemon was overpowering and very unpleasant in the lasagna. For the first time in my 50 years of living I have thrown out a jar of spice as I cannot use it; the lemon is yucky and seems very artificial. Real lemon would not be anywhere near as intense. There are many much better spice mixes available, including other Mrs Dash products- but they are greatly overpriced.	11
I downloaded this when it was the free app of the day, but I didn't play it until the other day. I had no issues with the app; it worked well. Visually, it was fine.My only problem with the app is that after you beat it, which shouldn't take more than about a half an hour, it has zero replay value. I uninstalled it to save space. (oh, I also had to use an app like superbox to be able to move it to SD card.)	1
For the first time in the 10 Days series, you can link travel tiles!  Th is truly the most unique element in this new addition to the 10 Days series.  I've had trips where I have 3-4 ocean liners all linked together before I even touch land again.  I like that.  I have also learned a lot about geography in central and south America.  Very fun and a nice new way to learn geography of the western hemisphere.  Something severely lacking in students knowledge base today.	22
The gel rest is comfortable.  However if you look at the picture closely, the pad is actually a bit thinner 4/3rd of the way to the left, I think the designer's ideal is to make the thickest part near the number pad on the right side..But the problem is that number pad is least used part of the keyboard, and when my hand rest on &#34;F&#34; and &#34;J&#34; key the right side gets a lot less coverage than the left side, and feel very unbalanced.	17
When I received the headphones I was pleasantly surprised. I had to find some that were cheap, as my Turtle Beach TBS-2052 Ear Force Z2 was damaged. I'm glad I listened to the good reviews I found.Surprisingly, the bass is deep, despite the size and type of headphones. If you like or not, that is a matter of personal taste. In my opinion, I had never bought a pair of headphones that were so cheap and also had such a good sound.One more thing: these headphones are not pretty, but its quality and durability are excellent.	10
This album is reel good. E-40, B-Legit, D-Shot, and Suga-T put doan some dope tunes and rhimes in dis 14 track album. I would say dat track 9, (Boss Baller), is da best track on here. Track 9 is D-Shot basically rappin' by  himself and da song is pretty damn dope. Get this album if ya like hardcore  rap or any rappers from SickWidIt. If you wish to e-mail me my addy is  yuckplace@hotmail.com.	9
I love the Beach Boys as much as anyone.  Let me say that again.  I love the BEACH Boys as much as anyone.  By that I mean I love the Beach Boys who actually live up to their name, singing about the beach, girls, surfing, cars, and Rhonda.This is not the Beach Boys.  It can't be.  Why?  No beach songs!  I thought it was some kind of joke.  All &quot;Pet Sounds&quot; offers is the opportunity to hear Brian Wilson whine for forty minutes, backed by elevator music.  There's barely any Mike Love on the album at all.Way overrated.	9
They are hard to find these days. I still prefer my VCR to DVD because I simply do not want to keep 90% of what I record and VCR is still the best way to go. DVDs are too expensive and I do not use cable or satellite or things like that. I get over 100 digital channels with my rabbit ears  and have very little time to actually watch TV, so I still rely on my good old VCR/DVD recorder to help me eventually view shows I want to see -- when I get the time.	10
"Used this for a Panasonic 32"" LCD TV.  Mount works fine, instructions were minimal.  I was able to use the supplied hardware to attach the TV and to attach the mount to the wall.  I did have a problem hanging the TV, per the instructions you have to mount the unit and now attach the TV, this was not very easy so I removed the mounting plate at the pivor point and took it off the wall mount, mounted this on the TV and now re-attached to the TV mount, this was a lot easier."	10
I couldn't get into The Wire, despite hearing about Idris and his acting excellence, but when I saw that Ruth Wilson was on this show too, I took the bait.  I've now watched the first season three times (something I never do) and I'm having a hard time holding off on restarting season two, as I want to save it as a precursor to this year's season three release.If you like good television, acting, writing, stories -- hell if you just like good things -- watch. this. show.	0
I liked that this was light and hydrating for my hands. As an artist, I work with a lot of mediums that require me to wash my hands afterward (i.e. paints, oil pastels), so one can imagine that my hands are prone to dryness. However, after two weeks of use, I got an allergic reaction from the lotion in the form of tiny, non-itchy bumps on the backs of my hands. I gave the rest to my friend who does like Aveeno, but I'll have to search for another hand lotion.	4
Minus one star for the constant popups asking you to upgrade or downloadother software from this company.Other than that, when you are playing blackjack, this is a great and authenticgaming application that also appears to give you a fair deal. In the last few monthssince downloading I have build a pretty good bank of over $80K, and risen to thetop 8% in all players standings. You cant do that with a corrupt app like Big FishCasino who will deal you a 14 on 15 straight deals. LOLThis is a great app, give it a try.	1
Kennedy knew what she was doing when she sat down and wrote this book.  The character John Garrett is just super sexy and to pair him with his Navy SEAL buddy Carson, yummers!  Throw in a woman who overhears that these two men thinks she probably only has `vanilla sex' and you got yourself a steamy book. I don't want to give too much away about this book because it is a quick read but this book made me go out and purchase the rest of the Out of Uniform series that I didn't have.~BookWhisperer Reviewer MC~	14
Men...if you have large pores that get clogged up this is for you.  I started using this two months ago.  It will keep your pores clean and open.  After just one month I found that the pores on my nose were staying open and actually seemed to be slowly diminishing in size.  I have this as one of my many subscribe and save items... so I know it will be a good price and I know it will arrive with all my other sub/saves on the 1st of every month.	4
A completely different book about magic, five-toed cats and a wife's quest for her missing husband.  A lighthouse keeper, away on a secret mission for the governor goes missing. Armed only with her husband's unusually descriptive letters, a stowaway orange cat and her fierce love for her husband, this determined provincial wife travels to an unfamiliar city to  hunt for her love.  A different kind of an adventure, where the magic is subtle, and not believing in it could be the difference between life and death. I thoroughly enjoyed this surprising book and highly recommend it!	14
This salad spinner has so many useful features. The push top locks into place so it takes up less space. The nifty brake button works really well. It spins fast enough to get the job done.The only reason we don't use it more often is because in the humid climate we live in we have to dry it completely every time we use it. If we leave even a slight residue of water and store it with the lid on it will never dry and mildews within a day or two. Other than that, we love it.	13
"I remember buying this soundtrack in the '90s, before I saw the movie, and loved how weird it was. There were a few songs that weren't composed by Goldsmith, and then there was the bit with Alec Baldwin as the Shadow. ""Original Sin"" is an awesome song; I listened to it so much back then. And Goldsmith's themes are memorable. I doubt you could hum it to someone and have them know where it's from, but I still think it's great and works perfectly with the movie. One of Jerry's best '90s efforts, most definitely."	6
I started kickboxing with this video, only to find it too challenging.  Though Kathy instructs you on careful and precise movements and good posture, you are really better off going to a class first where someone not  only instructs you but checks that you are doing the moves correctly.  However, after learning how to do the moves correctly, this video is  excellent, though occasionally repetitive.  Kathy and her friend can be a  little bit annoying, but once you break a sweat, they are the last thing  you're thinking about!	15
Amazon has really impressed me with their music store and system. Purchasing, downloading (and re-downloading, if you need to) are all simple. Playback is fairly simple, too.What will make this the best (it's not there yet; I am aware of the limitations):- adjustable bit rate streaming- enhanced flexibility in the player (playlists, tag editing, etc.)- purchase streaming-only version for a fraction of the cost (enable upgrade later)- mark previous purchases as purchased, and inaccessible for re-purchaseKeep up the great work!	1
If you're a Froosh fan like me, than look no further. These are the strings used by John Frusciante (formerly of the Red Hot Chili Peppers). These strings really are special. They help nail his tone and are slick, light, feel and handle bends perfectly. I use these on my 1962 Strat Reissue and they really compliment the stratocaster well. Highly recommended for those playing blues/funk/rock.Plus, I mean, come on, John mother *&%$#$% Frusciante uses them! :p	16
Though this jigsaw may seem costly, it's worth every cent. The case is well laid out and contains plenty of space for accessories. The extra blades are nice as well. Some people have complained about the blade changing system. I had no problems picking it up and it quite easy to change the blades quickly.The saw itself is powerful and smooth. I have cut some thick long boards with it easily and accurately. If you buy one, get the jigsaw table. It's very nice to have.	21
It's definitely high-tech, but since I don't own a classic-looking or vintage mandolin, I don't really care about looks. My primary concerns are comfort and function, and this product gets five stars on both counts. I really like the fact that you can attach the contact points, and using the click-locks, remove the strap from the instrument while leaving the contact points in place. Also, if you get the strap twisted up while installing it, just undo the click-locks, take out the twist, and reattach it. Pure function! This strap was very well designed and thought-out before going to manufacture. Five stars!	16
Product came without shipping slip, no protective packaging. .Bluetooth was placed in a plastic bag, slipped in an envelope and mailed.  Quality is very poor.  Crackling, buzzing muffled sounds very annoying and diapointing to recieve something you are expecting to use all the time to not being able to use it.  I would not recomend this vendor to anyone.  Description stated very clearly that it would be packaged in retai packaged and pictured with extra items.  This came with bluetooth only and charge cord; no instruction or any other accessories with this.	7
The songs on this cd are great. What made me buy it was my mom. My mom had a collage of music on tape. The song Tune in Tomorrow was on that tape. Let's say I owed mom the record because I warped the tape. Teena Marie shows soul music comes from the soul. What an excellent jazz song Wow. &quot;I need your lovin&quot; already a dance classic. The bass line hooks you in from the beginning. also get&quot;It must be Magic&quot; that cd will definitely get you started as a fan.	9
When I go to purchase batteries of odd sizes, like the A 23, they are usually priced at $3-$6. I have other gadgets that require an off size. If I paid retail store prices for these batteries, my money wouldn't go as far, as it is when I shop at Amazon.The tip I would give, is to have a Tupperware or similar type of container, to house all of the odd size batteries. I can buy a 5-6 pack of the odd size batteries, for a fraction of buying one from a retail store; pretty crazy.	12
I bought these after my son yanked open a drawer on a 5 drawer dresser and it tipped and fell on him. I was standing right there and was able to catch it and break the fall. If it had fallen on him I doubt he could have survived. We strapped everything in the house to the walls and found these straps to be easy to use. Its an added peace of mind having these in case I am ever not there to catch a falling dresser. Buy them, use them, prevent serious injury.	3
I started using this in combination with Raspberry Ketones and found it made me stronger in my workouts. I have also been able to keep weight off with it. But remember, nothing is a miracle pill. I use it in combination with regular workouts and watch what I eat. I keep track of calories and always expend more calories than I use. If you are not wanting to loose weight then taking this along with the Keytones about 30 minutes prior to workout should help you to be able to move more weight.	12
"I have another shovel purchased at our local big box store but this has become to the go-to shovel for both myself 5'3"" and my husband 6'2"".  It has a great pointed end that digs well into grass and dirt (I am in the process of getting rid of a lot of sod and turning it into flower beds).  We have also used this to dig out old tree roots from trees that were removed last year.  The oversize-step works well for people of different heights."	18
This game offers it all.  Shooting action, adrenaline pumping duck and dodge fire fights, rescue missions, covert action, gadgets, evil villains, story and plot, and a lot of weapons.  I reccomend this to any gaming fan.  Buy this game right now!  You don't know what you're missing if you don't.  The game also offers an incredible ammount of replay value with dozens of cheats that can be activated by getting record times in levels and also two levels that can be activated by beatin gthe game on different levels of difficulty.  All in all, a completely amazing game.  Buy it.  Don't hesitate.	23
"When I received the case it was a bit smaller than I expected but very accomodating. I fit my M&P; 22 which is the size of a standard M&P; pistol. My 1911 suprizingly also fit. They just fit nicely, no waisted space as shown in the description photo. I was very pleased.Outside 9.5"" X 6.5"" approximately, and inside 8.75"" X 5.5"" useable space. An additional magazine probably wouldn't fit with one of these larger guns however. A smaller pocket type pistol (Sig P238) would fit easy with an extra mag. Nice foam inside and secure latches."	20
This film is fantastic!  Jeff Daniels is the best George Washington I have ever seen!  The conversations convey the type of speech used in that colonial period, yet are understandable today.  The research that went into the costumes and props is phenomenal and makes the film look very authentic.The cast is wonderful, and this film is inspirational!For those who love this movie and would like to read more, I would recommend Thomas Fleming's exceptional book Washington's Secret War.  Having seen this movie, you will feel like you know this George Washington personally, as you turn the pages.	15
"I thought Duracells would last longer. Now I'm wondering if I have been duped by advertising, and I'm usually undupable. These Maxells last about 15-20% longer in my S3 camera with which I also take quite a few ""videos."" In an AM/FM radio, I'm getting six weeks using it two hours a day.I realize that everything's relative, but I've used Kodak, Maxell, Duracell, RayOVac, and generics. I'll stick with these, and the price is pretty good, too."	12
"I have used the Sanford highlighters for close to 20 years. there are nice. However, just yesterday I got some from a local store and it is now called ""Shapie by Sanford"". They are almost a disaster when highlighting textbooks. The wide brush is too wide. The side (the narrower brush) is really thin. So, I cannot highlight any books or textbooks and had to return them.I guess the new ones could be good for highlighting invoices or business computer printouts, but they may lose some customers who would like to highlight books."	17
I read the first story in this series and thoroughly enjoyed it. I went on a buying spree and got the other two as well as this short story. I suppose Laine's antics were meant to be comedic relief but I did not laugh not once. His antics were not funny. I did not buy Devlin being so amused by Laine's antics.I was shocked with how they resolved the conflict with Victor. I thought it was a weak plot point. This story was just ok. I wouldn't recommend anyone spending the money to buy it. If it were free, then yes.	14
I've been flying RC planes and I was looking into expanding my hobby to helicopters. I already own 4 helicopters out of which two are Walkera..well.. this heli is the king of the castle..making Walkera look like ordinary toys.. Coaxial design plus the gyro!!..it's super stable and extremely easy to fly!! The whole family will love it, including your dog.(if you have one).It's somehow limited to extreme maneuvers but that's a plus for a beginner.5 stars for the price/quality ratio!!!	22
The action is smooth and one handed, the blade is razor sharp.  The blade is rock solid when in extended position, no wobble.  The pocket clip is rock solid, unlike other knives I have owned.  I literally shaved my leg with it, no razor burn!!!  Now I walk around with a bald spot on my leg.  I also own the big brother of this knife, the pentagon elite II, they are the best folding knives I've ever owned.  I would recommend them with enthusiasm.	20
This is the type of novel I expect to be on the bestseller list and is why I typically overlook popular novels, sometimes to my own detriment. An elderly man, now in a nursing home, looks back on his time spent as a veterinarian in a circus. It's a story that could have been capable of more, but the plot seemed fairly predictable and the characters not that believable or rounded. It wasn't bad, mind you, I guess you could say this elephant was just too watered down.	5
I have a British friend, and once she knew I liked to drink tea, she said I had to get the PG Tips!  Now, I couldn't find them at any local store when I went shopping.  So when I saw these as an add on item, I put in my shopping cart, and waited for my next amazon purchase (never more than a week goes by, sad to say).  I got them home, put them in a sealed container, to keep them fresh, and brewed up a cuppa!  Yum!	11
Great way to keep your tongue jack from resting on wet ground or concrete, likely extending the life by not letting it rust out so quick.  Using with a tow package that includes a weight distribution assembly can prove problematic for smaller SUV's/cars though (tested with a 2008 Ford Escape with Class 3 hitch), as the tongue jack stand is so tall that you have to sometimes jack up your car up to clear it!  Still, I can't fault the jack stand for that.  Highly recommended.	2
Easy to install.  Did it myself - female with VERY limited electrical experience but I am good with tools.It works.  We haven't' had it that long so I can't speak to longevity but it is currently doing what it's supposed to be doing.  It's installed in our main bathroom and it gets a lot of use.Directions were very easy to follow and it looks ok when installed. I mean it looks exactly like the picture, nothing fancy or especially decorative.We bought 3 more for other fans.	13
I really like this over the capo that came in my guitar bundle from Austin Bazaar, so after some research online and talking to friends, I bought this capo.It goes on easily,comes off easily and does not mar the finish of my guitar. Downside, seems like it does not put enough pressure on all the strings. I will play with it some more and see how I like it over this weekend.Let me know if I am missing something about this capo that I should know. Thanks!	16
Good value for the money.  Of course durability is the best test, but I'll update that in a year.Great fit for me (XL).  Length is good and fits well through the shoulders.  Washed up very nicely on the 'out of the bag' initial wash.  Based on a bad experience with similar sweatshirts in the past, I used the lowest dryer setting to eliminate the possibility of shrinkage.  With imported clothing, it's really hard to know what is set and what is not.Definitely recommend this sweatshirt to anyone looking for low price and decent quality.	8
This is my first exposure to Wuthering Heights, and I always thought of itas these star-crossed lovers.  I couldn't finish watching after 3/4 of the film,seeing person after person destroyed through these two people's obsessionwith each other.  Heathcliff is near demonic in his revenge on the Earnshawfamily.  Catherine is selfish, and vain, not caring for her brother, her nephew,her sister-in-law as their lives are destroyed.  This isn't about society vs. nature.This is about human decency overcome by an animal attraction.  Gothic it certainly is.	15
I would say this was worth the price, but I probably won't buy it again.  If you mind cooking up meat treats and/or you mind smelling like a barbecue when you carry the treat bag around, this might be worth a try.  Me, I like cooking and smelling like dinner.Pros:Dog will eat the treatsWill keep in your pocket or treat bag without going bad and stinkingCons:Not as high-value as non-freeze-dried meat/liver (my guess is this doesn't have as strong a smell as fresh, so it's not as attractive a treat)More expensive than buying bulk liver yourself and roasting it	19
Living near the woods, we have all kinds of critters:  chipmunks, squirrels, rabbits, racoons, and deer.  In addition there is my nutty dog, so I don't want to use anything toxic around her.  Deer Off has non toxic ingredients, and so far seems to repel the critters, though it's still early in the season and I haven't yet planted my flowers due to the cold weather.  I especially like that Deer Off doesn't require mixing, an improvement over products I've used in past years.  So far so good, but I'll update on effectiveness when my garden is planted.	18
I have tested this against the griffin dual output unit.I checked the charging current.This unit was charging my galaxy note battery with 70 ma.Griffin was charging with 40 ma! And the griffin was 4 times more expensive.I have not used these for very long. I bought 15 of them, because they are so cheap and because they actually do seem to provide high current.No idea how long they last. I assume they will work fine. I have not been using them much. I did the testing , just to stock up on a high current charger. This passed and I stocked up.	7
The X-Acto School Pro Electric Pencil Sharpener is fantastic.  It does not over sharpen pencils and is easy to use.  It can fit 6 different sizes of pencils and has a marking for the standard size!  My kindergartener and my 4 year old both use it with ease.  It is easy to empty, and the container that holds the shards is firmly attached - does not come out easily while sharpening.  The suction cups stick firmly to table top so you don't have to press down on top to hold steady.	17
I found the writer was very good at portraying people and places. There are lots of twists and turns before the story is revealed. I would have given it 3,5 stars. There is nothing inherently wrong with the book. I just found it too drawn out and a bit repetitive. She kept going over the same ground and same people. The end was a bit abrupt and I did find her constant denials about magic becoming irritating. But it was an interesting book and I am sure many people will enjoy it.	14
I have been looking for this movie for years and years and could not remember details about it nor the name of it. Found it and WOW it's great. The book is awesome too, however the book is a mock text book about dragons and how they function, live, fly, etc, where as the movie is the story of the guy who wrote the book and how he met dragons, learned about them, and gained the knowledge to write the book. Lets not forget to mention James Earl Jones is a voice in the film. ;)	6
Don't expect it to sound like a regular guitar and you won't be disappointed. That said, I find it useful for composing on the road. Heck, it even sounds better than my big guitars, in an odd way, for certain songs. Nice sturdy and portable case. Not good for overheads in airplanes because it takes up space for several bags, but flight attendants will usually store it in the locker up front if you ask. Action is adequate for practice--with a little tweaking it's actually good. Quiet enough to play in your hotel room and not disturb your neighbors.	16
I couldn't find this at my two local hardware stores, they didn't stock any bar and chain oil surprisingly. I used this in my newHusqvarna 450 18-Inch 50.2cc X-Torq 2-Cycle Gas Powered Chain Saw With Smart Start (CARB Compliant)and it works great. They don't recommend you use any motor oil or different purposed oil so I definitely recommend this product. I had some husqvarna chain oil in my last chainsaw for years, and to be honest I can't find any difference in noticeable viscosity or functionality of that product over this (it was a lot more expensive).	18
Zelda: Ocarina of Time is a well-made game that perfectly blends battle sequences and puzzles.  The battles, which can only be won using the right method against the right enemy, are simplified by Z-Targeting, which aims all attacks at the enemy.  It takes a long time to beat (months), as any good RPG (Role-Playing Game) should.  Unfortunately, it constantly and inevitably reminds you of the controls, although they're pretty easy, in messages which you usually must read.  I suggest this for all people, especially those that enjoy a good challenge.	23
I loved the game the first time i played it through, but as with MOST (not all) games, it got boring the second time around...:(...It strays far from the movie. It has the basic characters, but is not like the movie. You will recognize a few items and place from the movie...like the palace, of the last part of the game, where you defeat Darth Maul, but it was just kind of a game to sell and make money...It's fun, but doesn't lastJason Anderson	23
A relatively thick, viscous liquid that cleans leather like crazy.  You only need just a bit on a wet rag, then it's off to the races cleaning your leather.  I use this on a leather couch, auto upholstery, shoes, boots and a leather jacket.It only cleans, but it does that well.  For protection you'll need something like Lexol Leather Conditioner (furniture, auto, jacket) or Nikwax (shoes and boots).A little goes a LONG way, doesn't take much to get the cleaning done.  One bottle has lasted me several years.	2
...with a twist of goth and one seriously bad serial killer!This book really held my interest all the way through, but then the ending came and went in a flash.  With so much build up, I would have thought the ending would take longer to complete itself - not so.The detail given to describe the setting of each scene was incredible.  Also, you were provided deep insight into the characters, even the lesser ones.  There was nothing vague about this book.Formatting was off, but it wasn't too distracting after a while.	14
This game is fun, don't get me wrong, but the problem is that this game offers nothing new to the style of game created by Capcom's own Resident Evil series.  Basically its the same story you're trapped on an island where dinosaur research has run amuck and your goal is the escape before getting devoured by the many dinosaurs you'll run accross while playing this game.  ALong the way you'll have to also solve some puzzles to be able to escape the island.  So basically if you enjoyed Resident Evil or any of its clones, Dino Crisis is a game for you.	23
"This book has everything.  War, Romance, and the little known history of the Spanish Civil War.Hemingway is at his best in this book.  His keen journalistic eye doesn't miss a detail.Although the era he is writting about has long since gone by the reader cannot help but be pushed back in time.There is one scene that always sticks in my mind.  I think Pablo's mujer is telling Robert Jordan about a village they ""cleaned"" of fascist.  The details of the brutality in that section of the book will give any reader a glipse of what war is."	5
I bought 3 of these sweatshirts and love them all. They are a great quality and warm and soft and cozy.  They have a reasonable price and fit nicely.  I am a female and I bought a small and they fit comfortable. I normally wear a medium in sweaters and shirts but thought since this is more of a man's sweatshirt  I would try the small.  I must admit if I was a store, I would of tried the medium just to check.  But I am pleased with this purchase.  Shipped quickly.	8
YUCK! I am really starting to think many of these rave reviews are fake, because go on over to Makeupalley and everyone else hates this product as well. I have never in my life actually thrown away a full product, until this one. It was literally unusable. It made my face look muddy, not natural at all. And it also clumped up around my eyebrows and the sides of my face, even though I didn't use that much! It just looked so bad, I didn't feel guilty about throwing it in the garbage at all. Buy at your own risk	4
Real nice build to this razor. It's hard to beat the German quality. However, I believe this razor is not aggressive enough. I actually got a  better shave with my $12.00 Lord. I just don't get that close shave feeling, even after two passes. Maybe I should try a third pass, but I don't think it's going to matter. I've used both Feather and the Gillette 7 O'clock Sharp Edge blades. The new feather worked better this morning. I'll try it for a few days more and see how it goes.	12
Pros:  It's gorgeous.  Silver face and silver mesh band goes with anything.  Looks much more expensive than it is.  Beautiful, sparkly round diamond-like chips for the numbers.  Lays flat against the wrist - not bulky and very comfortable.  Easily adjustable band.  Keeps good time.Cons:  No deal-breakers here, just things you might want to know ~ Not waterproof so you can't wear it in the shower. I have long hair and every once in a while it will catch in the mesh band. And no date display, if that's important to you.	8
Couldn't agree more with Amazon's review - this is a high quality saw that rivals DeWalt and other competitors.  Weight is not a problem, and handles on the top and both ends of the base make this easy to move around your shop or job site.  The handle is very comfortable and convenient to use right or left-handed.  Dust collection is good and noise is low.  The saw arrived quickly as always from Amazon and required little adjustment out of the box.  Highly recommend!	21
this is a crazy comedy, with nonsense & ridiculous, but donna summer is spectacular in her last dance perforfance. commodores with lionel ritchie singin & playing sax, the dance of the leatherman. i can't stand paul jabara. i can't believe he dared to go into a recording carreer after this. i have one of his albums, with 2 songs duet with donna summer & they are no better than disco duck. watch it, is gonna be 90 minutes of crazy 70's style fun, because some of the jokes are dated, & a lot of casablanca & motown disco music in the background.	15
The elf on the shelf is a super cute idea but be aware it does take work!  My 8 year old and 4 year old understand the story and are very excited every morning to see where the elf ends up.  My older daughter has asked those questions you would expect. The only thing I don't like is for the kids on the fence (believe or not believe) I think that this could give some more doubt.  Probably better for ages 3-6 years. I do wish I would have got it when they were younger.	22
It takes up very little space when not being used,  but has worked great in making it much easier to movie two pieces of luggage with one hand.My only caution is be sure that you snap the pieces together as they were intended to be snapped together. If you snap together with the one piece upside down, you'll need pliers to get them apart. So watch what you're doing and don't be stupid . . . or careless. And don't ask whether it was me or not who was stupid or careless.	8
"When 'The Song Remains the Same' came out in cinemas way back in 1976 Led Zeppelin were really giving fans an experience of them 'Live' but on the big screen.Unfortunally fast forward to the year 2003 & much anticipated ""DVD"" is the complete picture of the career from 1969 to Knebworth 1979.Granted it was released several years ago, but it really needs 5.1 sound mixed. Still good to watch but showing it's age in production / camerawork & lack of any editing.A Robert Plant DVD would be a worthy edition to my collection if one does finally get released."	6
Um, if you're looking for budget violin strings, then you probably aren't playing principle violin in the New York Philharmonic. Me neither. I'm an abhorrent violinist, but I teach Mariachi Band to elementary school students. On my el cheapo violin, these strings sound quite nice. I would give them 5 stars, but I think that would be overselling them a bit. They're fine. If you're looking for 5 star strings, you're going to have to pay more-and ask someone who plays better than I do to review them for you.	16
"although poorly directed, the casting is good.  I was certain Mr Hind could be a good Rochester from his understated performance in Persuasion.However the characters as protrayed in this version of Jane Eyre badly need more ""understatement"" .  Emotional restraint does not seem to have been demanded of them... or perhaps the director thought this film could be called Jane Eyre with no need to be at all true to the  tone of the book.  Such in-your-face emoting simply turns the film into a sloppy pot boiler. And probably embarasses even the well chosen cast"	15
What a great product this is!!!  Perfect clarity, small package, sweet all around, I can find nothing bad to say about 'Etymotic Research HF2 Hands-Free Earphones / Headset'.  If you are looking for a compact solution for listening to MP3s from your iPod or phone this is a wonderful product.  Pricey? Yes but you get what you pay forHeadphones come with lots of other replacement ear buds as well, this is sonic marvel that will blow you away!***** HIGHLY RECOMMENDED	7
I use to love these in the '80's but hi-tops became obsolete.  Glad I could find some because in the hot summer I hate wearing my ankle braces as they make my feet sweat too much and constrict my blood flow making my feet and ankles swell.  Anyway, although I haven't worn these out of the house yet, I'm sure they will work well for me provided I still use my cane.  I will admit in reading the other reviews, they do run narrow which was fine with me and the length was perfect.  Nicely made too.	8
This is Nick Drake's most upbeat album, which isn't saying much, I realize.  He does combine elements of smooth jazz, horn lines and sax into his folk sentiments; it works well together.  While I wouldn't call it a happy album, it is nice, smooth and mellow.As always Drake's lyrics are built upon a series of images, mostly derived from nature.  Personally I find them the strongest element of his composition; but in this album the music is superb as well.	9
I like the product, i like the idea to have something that can hold the picks so they dont get lost, i thought that it could hold a few more picks. I think i putted about 7 picks in it, but hey, it works and i would buy it again.I forgot to say that there is double sided tape on the back if you want to put it on your guitar (thats what i did, it looks good and durable).Also, It's Cheap!!!!!	16
"A mixture of several of his hits.  There are some omissions such as ""Be"" (from Jonathan Livingston Seagull) and ""Holly Holy"", but it includes several of my favorites, such as ""America"", ""Sweet Caroline"", ""I Am I Said"", and ""Brother Love's Traveling Salvation Show"" (I still wonder if that song is meant to mock Christianity or rather to paint the picture of an old tent revival).I will say that I prefer Diamond's vocals on the Beatles tribute than the original."	6
In our part of the mid Atlantic, the last warm days of the year have brought out new swarms of brown marmorated stink bugs. Even though we try not to agitate them, efforts to redefine the boundary between human and insect space invariably result in the discharge of the odor that gives them their sobriquet.Clean Day is very effective at cutting the stink bug odor. Its own scent is pleasant without being overpowering.Liquid hand soap may be a commodity item, but your own peace of mind isn't. This is our go-to for eliminating the unfortunate outcomes of human-stink bug encounters!	4
I'm rating this 5 stars because it works great. I'm like many people that try to use their Braun cleaner fiuld for too long. I've added water and rubbing alochol, but it just doesn't feel as good when cleaned. I stocked up on these from Amazon to always have freash cleaning fluid in the house. I don't pay sales tax and shipping is FREE when purchasing items over $25 combined. If you want to keep your Braun razor in great shape and get a clean, smooth and fresh shave, get this and change timely.	12
"Well, I know I'm a little late to this CD (12 years) but I looked it up on Amazon after hearing the first selection on Laugh USA Sirius XM last week.  I listen to that station for some smiles and giggles when I'm driving.  Brian Regan came on talking about ""you too"" and ""take luck"" and I almost had to pull over to the side of the road.  I was laughing so hard it really was dangerous!So now I have the CD and I listen at home where it's much safer for everyone.  It's just hilarious, no two ways about it."	6
I bought this for around 2.50 shipped with amazon prime. This was a great price to buy 50 packets of stevita supreme. I use one packet in my tea and 2 in my coffee. it's perfect for use in sweetening iced tea or coffee, hot or cold i've not noticed any fake aftertaste. Doesn't give me a headache like sweet and low or equal will. Stevia has 0 calories and comes from a natural plant. stevita is the best brand I've tried. I will order this again.	11
"My little boxer-pit bull mix has chewed through every ""durable"" toy there is.  I got her the ""wolf"" size Galileo and had to help her start it (it's slippery before they scratch it up) but now she loves it.  If you have a dog that can chew the other durable Nylabone products down to a nub then this is for you!  It doesn't even seem to matter that it's not flavored (at least not to my knowledge).  I would also recommend the Nylabone Double Action Chew - this one has also lasted far longer then the Nylabone durable regular bones."	19
This CD Lens Cleaner didn't work for our broken system that could no longer read CDs.  But it has worked on systems in the past.  Simple and fast to use, you just pop it into the player like a regular CD.  There is none of the nonsense with fluids like they had in the old days.  It's a simple mechanism- it has a small brush-like device that gently cleans the laser lens.So look at it like this: this is a cheap investment to try something that might work for your broken CD/DVD player.	10
This is the best phone I ever owned.  Reception is very good, battery life is good, ring is audible, and quality of voice is very good.  Mine already came with ear phone, USB cable, leather case and 256MB memory card.  There are a few things that are not so good: - Need to clean cover frequently (it gets easily smudged); - MP3 sound is not perfect (well this is a phone not a MP3 player); - Once when I switched the GSM card it reverted to Kanji characters and I had a hard time to find the English option ;)	7
When you first put this on the table you feel like it has made things safer for your child, however the first time they get near it they are able to pull it off because the adhesive provided with it doesn't hold well unless you have a completely flat surface to attach it to.  (I suppose if you use a stronger adhesive you would run the risk of damaging the table).Only buy if you have a large top face and edge to the table with no decorative surface changes (must be completely flat to hold at all)	3
The title says it all...the edges of the bumpers were very tempting for my daughter to peel every chance she got. You'd think her ability to remove the ends of the bumpers would indicate the bumpers would be easy to remove.They were a nightmare and have ruined our beautiful coffee table. I've tried goo gone to no avail. If anyone has any tips how to get the tape off, which is coated with random pieces of foam from the old bumpers, I'd love to hear them. I can't believe how awful my table looks.	3
Stevie Wonder speaks in the language of music - whether you like r&b, jazz, soul, funk, or rock you will be able to appreciate him - he is one of the great entertainers of all time. His voice is so bright and soulful and his instrumental talent is incredible. 'Innervisions' is  a very well-crafted album that gels together and seems to be an even greater expression than the monumental 'talking book' - I would recommend both albums - this one just seems to be the crowning achievement.	9
Pros: good pairing and consistent stream. Decent sound although not loud enough.Cons: very uncomfortable fit(my ears hurt just after an hour of having them on), lots of background noise, sound doesn't get loud enough in pulic busy places, extremely annoying when you wear any jacket since you keep feeling it catch.Bottom line: Don't buy it! The participles for a good device is there but they need to improve on the design and make a lot more comfortable before people can start enjoy using it.	7
A bore snake simplifies cleaning and makes the job quicker.  I have used this one on both .22LR and .223 Rem / 5.56 NATO rifles with great results.  Simply drop the weighted end through the bore, squirt some CLP or whatever you choose to clean the barrel, and pull it through.  Repeat a couple of times and the barrel is clean.When the bore snake is dirty, simply throw in the sink with hot water and gentle detergent, agitate briefly, and rinse with clean water.  Now it is ready for the next cleaning job.	20
So far I have to say that this is the best masher I've ever had, and at 65, I have had or used any number of them.  The &#34;wire&#34; portion is solid, sturdy and will never bend.  The handle is long, has an adequate circumference and is padded, making it easy to grip and at the same time, comfortable.  To top it all off, the end of the handle has extra padding on it so when you bear down it doesn't feel uncomfortable.  Great product and worth the price!	13
Having the ability to track both food you eat and the exercise you do in one app is great. Makes you accountable to yourself.  My sister me to this app and now we keep track of how we are doing. You can invite others to join you also. I have the  app on my pc and my tablet.  The app sync each device so you only have to enter in one place and all you devices are update. Should impress my doctor when he asks how I am doing on my weight loss.	1
The NewTrent IMP52D is an ergonomically designed charger for your personal electronics.  It works with USB charging cables to recharge your devices.  I purchased two, one for me and one for my wife.  When I can't reach people because their smartphones are dead, I will recommend this product.  The build in laser pointer is awesome, and it even has an auto-off so that the battery isn't depleted by leaving it on.  I can't wait to try some of NewTrent's other products!	7
I got this for Christmas, and what a fun game. We played with a variety of people and age levels, and everyone seemed to enjoy it. It isn't complicated, so even if you have younger people (or a lot older, for that matter), they'll be able to play with you. The game also takes a reasonable amount of time, meaning that it isn't very lengthy like Settlers or even Monopoly tends to be. You should be able to get a few rounds in during a game night with friends.	22
We have had a pressure cook for many years.  It was great for camping, for we could make New England Boil Dinner.  My wife has our old one at the shore, and we use it a lot.  However, many of the family are not there but in our villa 100 miles away, and we like many meals that we us the Presto pressure cooker.  Now, I can make the dinners here, and we thing they are the best pressure cookers around.  It is great time saver.	13
Hello, EveryoneI'm a type of guy who reads almost every single review negative and positive and come up with a conclusion for myself. I also very heavily rely on the star rating. Anything 3 stars and below I'm very careful to order; anything 4/5 stars I still do my work but rely more on peoples reviews.Delivery: Arrived quicklyCondition: Undamaged, great condition.Product itself: This product works along with its tongue gel it gets rid of that nasty white gunk on your tongue that causes bad breath!Recommend it: Yes I would.	12
Thinking back on the times of Zelda, have got me thinking. The game was absolutely breath taking, I remember how fun and exciting it was, and it was so good, because of the challenge. If there is still anyone who has not played and beaten this game, please get it, it is totally worth the money. Then in 4 or 5 years, you too can think of what a great game Zelda was, but then you will feel bad for neglecting your Nintendo 64 and playing your PS2, but PS2's time for neglection will come in a few years also.	23
"If you wanna grill and cook like a pro, you need to shell out $15 for these tongs! They are great! Now if i could locate i restaurant supply store that generic 16"" tongs for cheap i would probably buy a few of those instead, but these tongs are worth it! i have manhandled lots of baby back ribs and 5lb roasts with these bad boys no problem! i would have preferred a simpler locking mechanism, i mean if it ain't broke dont fix it, but the locking mechanism on these has helf up so far."	13
Can't say too much about it becuase if your system takes this filter pad sleeve, then you have to buy it. And the pad does what it is suppose to do. I was surprise at how the price has gone up in recent years for this item. That is why I recommend washing the pads and reuse them until they begin to fall apart. The best way is to take it outside and use a strong stream of water from a garden hose. The water from the wash can also help your plants grow better.	19
"The movie ""Freakonomics"" is based on the best-selling book of the same name.  Several documentaries, each with different directors, show how economics can work in daily life.  Cheating on pupil tests, the drop in crime rates in the USA, incentives in potty training, pupil achievement, and other interesting nuances that economists deal with are featured.  A lot of economics is predicting behavior of people, and that can be dicey.  Overall it provides a light and interesting way of looking at the dark science. The movie has good ideas and the scripts move well to keep you interested."	0
This game is easy to learn and a great party game.  The rules are basically to try to get your team to say a word without using the five restricted words.  I suppose you score per word, but we never keep score.  As a nonexistent example, there might be a card with &quot;breakfast&quot; as the word and &quot;food&quot;, &quot;pancake&quot;, &quot;morning&quot;, &quot;eat&quot;, and &quot;waffle&quot; on it.  It's entertaining watching someone try to explain a word without being able to use one that they really want to.  I recommend this for any family or group of friends.	22
I HATE THIS TOY!!! IT LOOKS SO MUCH FUN BUT HTEN, ONCE YOU BUY IT, IT BREAKS!!! THE TRAPS ARE BROKEN AND THE BOARD GOT SCRATCHED!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I HATE THIS TOY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! DO NOT BUY IT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!	22
I now own three pair of these,  They are a bargain, as I have dozens of earbuds (mostly in ear) and their efficiency and sealability give a full rich sound.  The only pair I ever &#34;broke&#34;  was a pair that I sent through the wash TWICE!  You will spend at least 2-3 times their price to beat them.  One audiofile stated that he felt another set was much better (at $299.00)  Again, best value given their  price and performance.	10
This Fiskars rake is basically the same exact thing as any other rake I've ever used.  I have two complaints- one, it clogs leaves very easily, which of course means constantly stopping to pull the leaves away, and two, it's not as sturdy as it might appear.  Mine hasn't exactly broke yet, but I get the feeling it will in a couple months.  Those are my only complaints.  The long handle is nice, too.  Helps out my achy breaky back after all those snowstorms we stinkily had to experience last winter.	18
I bought this album waaaaaaaaaaaay back in 1996 when I was still a college student and it quickly became one of my favorite CDs ever.  The style goes from bouncy quick ska-punk (Sunday Morning) to cute gimmick song (Just A Girl) to mature wistfulness (Don't Speak) and all the way back again.  No Doubt are certainly talented artists.  I had the privilege of seeing No Doubt play live at RockFest in Texas in 1997 and I was absolutely blown away.  They aren't one of those canned studio acts that sound [bad] live....they really rock.	9
It works well.  This is a classic design that people have used for years and I can see why.  It it isn't broke, don't fix it.The only suggestion I would make is to have a different soundhole cover.  Maybe a sturdy plastic? The soundhole cover that is included is a very cheap, disposable plastic that looks like it was shipped with a cheap trinket.  I think the price is a little high for what it is. Rubber and foam tube?  Why do they charge so much?  I'd like to know the markup.	16
I don't think my skin is overly sensitive or anything but this product caused my neck to start burning and itching, I had to wash the product off of my neck immediately.It also caused my face to break out, I gave it a few tries to see if my skin just needed to get used to it but my skin was not happy.For me this was a waste of money. It also has this chemical smell that even my fiance noticed after I put it on.I would not recommend this.	4
Yes, I did find this a bit cumbersome. I wanted a more puzzle oridented game. I kept getting stuck in seemingly absurd situations and go to a walk-through forum to make progress. One of the comforts is that a cheat code can take you to the next level, if you get frustrated through not being able to figure out some trick to advance. Lara is a great character. But in this game she is faced with too many obstacles and impossible-to-discover secrets to make the game truly enjoyable.	23
Seriously - this stuff smells good enough to put on my scrambled eggs. I don't use a sprayer. so I diluted this in water and splashed on and around the area I want to protect. My main varmints are bunnies and squirrels - eating my flowers, chewing through my landscaping power cables and drip water system supply lines. The squirrels even damage the chainlink fence - they chew through the wires holding the fence to the supports. So I diluted this stuff in water and splashed the fence, wires, and drip system. No more chewing damage!	18
The relationships between the characters are all out of balance.  We see far too much of Frank, we get a mean and nasty Knightly, an Emma few would love, the Elton's are cartoonish, and the tacked on ending - the Harvest Festival - bringing in the sheaves, we will come rejoicing, bringing...is nothing Austen ever wrote, anywhere! The set piece dance at the end featuring the, here, three couples joined in bliss, Knightly and Emma, Frank and Jane, and Harriet and Robert Martin (Robert Martin? What, you didn't know he was a dancer?) is just contrived romantic twaddle.Hiss.  Boo.  So NOT Austen.	15
"I really enjoy eating Dungeness crab here in San Francisco, peak season is NOW, December.  The secret to picking all the meat out of the crab lies with the correct crab instruments.  I've tried the Oxo seafood picks and also the Zyliss style.  The Zyliss with its curved forked end is 'da best.  And buy your self a pair of the ""Progessive brand"" seafood scissors and be ready to enjoy eating Dungeness crabs with minimal hassle.  You may need two scissors because Dungeness crab aficionados will fight over them, really, been there witnessed it.JMO!!!!"	13
Super sharp and fast,smooth cut. I mostly use this saw for undercutting door jambs and casing in prep for tile and hardwood. Beware of nails though! I have ruined 2 or 3 blades by hitting nails that were buried in the bottom of the door jamb( door installer didn't remove shipping nails).I never use the rip edge though ,wish both sides were crosscut.Shark does make a model that is crosscut on both sides but not in the 17tpi. Very impressed with Shark tools, their prybar/nail puller is indispensable.	21
I bought this because I thought I was going to try a cleanse that involved this very specific tea. I've done cleanses before, and I enjoy tea, normally. This very one, however, was like drinking a liquid nightmare. I would plug my nose and try to force it down, but I couldn't do it any longer and ditched it.I didn't want to give it a poor review, because I'm sure this is the nature of this tea. But JEEZY PEETE, I hope no one is drinking this for fun.	11
I bought this to clean up the bits of cat litter my cat tracks onto the bathroom floor  when he jumps out of his litter box.  For this it works stupendously.  I haven't tried it on carpet or as a hand-held, but it seems to be durable and have plenty of suction power, and it has brushes you can turn on for use on carpet.  The extra battery pack is a bonus, tho' I haven't run down the first battery pack yet.  The battery seems to last a long time.	13
I ordered these to wear during workouts (WiiFit, Tae-Bo, and Yoga).  I ordered a 38EU, which should have been a bit small, if anything, according to the sizing chart.  Not so.  They are actually about a size (or 1 1/2 size) too big.  It's a shame, because they seem to be nice, otherwise, and would be great for working out.  Lightweight, and seem to be well made.  I'm going to give them to my sister, who should be able to fit them.	20
We just received this game yesterday and we played it twice right away with my 5 yr old and 7 yr old. It was a lot of fun. It's a matching game with a little extra. I loved that we figured out what was hidden in the secret door by working together. Yes the little cards are not the strongest cardboard they could have used and that is my only complain. I will probably paste them on to a stronger cardboard to make them last long. The board is a nice. It's on a  thicker and stronger cardboard.	22
this game is way better than pac-man because it has more things you can do then pac-man. I wont give any of the secrets away, but u can move stuff and trigger things and even get shockers that make the red squares(bad guys) freeze for a bit...( kind of like pac-man). There is only one thing I would change and that would be the controls. idk how I would improve them,but now they are abut hard and ive died a few times because of them. but besides that, this game is awesome!! #waybetterthanpac-man(;	1
I have almost nothing but good things to say about this entire series. This book kept me on the edge of my couch the entire time! I'm kind of nerdy, so all of the technical details really added to the richness of the picture for me. This shot straight to the top of my favorites.The ideas covered in this were also very mind-expanding. I do have to say, I wish there was more time given to any kind of gayness or a gay struggle in this. Women enjoyed great status, however. I liked that.	5
We are so glad that we bought this gate. We use it in the entrance to our son's room. It keeps him in and our 3 dogs out. Completly hands free is such a plus!!!!!! Simple to use!!! Fits very snug...it isn't going anywhere. The vertical only slats are great because our son tries to climb this gate and I truely believe that if we had bought a traditional gate with vertical and horizontal slats that he would be able to climb it!!! I recommended this to all our friends already!!!	3
I have 2 Dachshunds and a cat and this fountain is perfect. Purchased a different fountain and it stopped working after a few days. This fountain got great reviews, that's the reason why I got it and I'm very pleased with it. My pets have no trouble drinking out of it and they have fresh water all of the time. I do empty the water out and wash the bowl twice a week to get out the junk that the dogs' leave from drinking, which I would do with any bowl. Other than that, I'm sold!	19
"What a good album. ""Another Sad Love Song"" is upbeat while ""Breathe Again"" is sensuous and cherubic. ""Seven Whole Days"" is for people who miss their special partner. There are 5 singles from Toni Braxton's debut! ""Love Affair"" has a nice beat. ""Candlelight"" is breathtaking. ""Spending My Time With You"" is energetic. ""Love Shoulda Brought You Home"" has great piano. ""I Belong To You"" sounds merry. ""How Many Ways"" brings up the idea of different love techniques. ""You Mean The World To Me"" is fantastic but serious. ""Best Friend"" is a slow jam with piano. Enough said."	9
You open the box and get right to play, with instructions so easy they are almost self-explanatory.  Even the youngest in the family has early successes on this game -- it's a winner.Non-competitive, brainy game.Best of all, kids can play by themselves (just one player) if they are so inclined.  In that regard, it reminds us of another favorite game: Castle Logix.Castle LogixThis game is a keeper.  It would be a great gift for any family.We also like Castle Logix, another game with increasing levels of difficulty.  And Tantrix.Family Games tantrix discovery game packCastle Logix	22
"This is a bloated, self-indulgent, boring mess.  When this film came out, I remember thinking that if thisis the great Led Zeppelin, then they are quite overrated.  Some of the songs are way too long, the videosequences are almost laughable and Plant is either having a bad night or is already struggling to be thePlant of a few years earlier.  Get the excellent double DVD ""Led Zeppelin"" instead - way, way better.It not only shows the band at various points in their fairly brief history but does indeed demonstatewhat a terrific group they actually were.  In its wake, ""Song"" is now useless."	6
I always have heartburn after a spicy meal.  Unfortunately, I lived in Mexico for a number of years, and it caught up to me.  I have ulcers, and terrible about taking care of them.  Nonetheless, Pepcid AC gets me through the meal & through the night.  No waking up with caffeine burns & or too much hot sauce burns.  I like what I drink & I like what I eat & as unhealthy as that may be at times, Pepcid AC is there for me....and she doesn't judge me either ;)  GOOD BUY!	12
This game is so realistic! I felt like I was actually playing Blackjack! What is that you say, you detect a bit of sarcasm in my tone? Well aren't you the detective! Five stars to you too! Seriously- its blackjack. How you can have real vs fake blackjack, I do not know, but feel free to clue me in if you know the answer to that one. The game is fun, its always a good primer before you go into the casino and spend your actual money.	1
"Can't chop anything well.  [Tried onions, tomatoes, celery, olives, nuts, and many other items.]  Tried 2, 4, and 8-oz loads.  Tried 1/8, 1/4, 1/2 cup loads.All you get is half mush and the other half ""as is"".I think it could ""mix"" 1/4 cup of cooked rice with a 1/2 cup of water ... but who needs that?This will be the last Cuisinart product I'll buy; their griddler, blender, and ice cream maker are poorly engineered too ... and I long ago stopped using them."	13
Gotta say - this is a great filmPersonally - aside from the set design - I wasn't crazy about Metropolis, so I didn't know what to expect with this piece of Lang'sHowever, this was an excellent film --- obviously, nothing can compete with Metropolis's set design....... however, this film had an amazing and powerful story attached to it, that is likely going to grab EVERYONE!!!!!I don't wanna give it away, but its a highly political one, that leaves no one without criticismIf Fritz were alive today, I'd be willing to bet that he would be running for President on the Liberterian ticket	6
When the item came, the batteries were already dead.  I ran to the drugstore to buy new batteries, but the store didn't carry the correct kind.  Even if they did, we could not get the battery cover off.  It says to just use a coin, but we did that and all it did was strip the plastic.  Both my husband and I tried with various tools, but we couldn't open the battery cover.  We'll keep trying, but right now it's basically a big waste of money.	12
I like to watch this dvd whenever I need to be &quot;free&quot; from any hard work. Charlotte has a beautiful and soothing voice, a gift from heaven. I like whole tracks especially &quot;Danny boy&quot;, &quot;When at  night I go to sleep&quot;, and an aria from &quot;Carmina Burana&quot;.My complaints about this dvd are that the running time is too short with  just 11 songs and the subtitles especially translated into English are not  provided.Anyway, this dvd is definitely worth getting if you like  classical or soothing or inspirational music.	6
Its the reunion of Scarface, Big Mike, Willie D, Ganxsta Nip, DJ Ready Red & Bushwick Bill back in 199Six, better & harder beats than their previous N.W.A. era kicks, the Kings of Houston, TX are back commin' str8 outta 5th Ward!  A tight Horrorcore song on this track is I Just Wanna Die by that psycho Bushwick Bill, and the Hard-Thuggish Ruggish hit Niggas And Flies done by Willie D & Scarface!  This GB Album is waaay better than any N.W.A. or post-Geto Boy Tracks.  Best songs are 2,3,6,7,8,9,10,11,*12,*13 & 15.	9
I bought this one to replace a Shure 8900. It's a big step up from that one. I am pleased with it. The old one had a lot of handling noise. This one has a little but it is very good for the money I paid for it. My next one will be an SM58, but that will be awhile from now. I'm very happy with this PG58.Update:December 2012The handling noise is definitely something to consider. It would keep me from buying another one of these. Other mics I own don't have this problem to this degree.	16
These bottle nipples work as intended. Our baby never did the jump to the largest ones (I.e. fast flow, etc), so we had to keep using this kind for several months. The thing is that, at the end of their lifetime, the 2 holes on top widen and allow more liquid to go through. When that happened, the baby would refuse to drink anymore and it was really frustrating. I'm not knocking off any stars on this review because it is not really a defect or downside. It's jut the result of normal &#8220;&#34;wear an tear&#8221;. Just be mindful of it.	3
The package arrived in about 6 days and in the advertised condition. I've bought Maxell products in the past(especially cassette audio tapes and vhs tapes) and have never been disappointed. The color and sound are both exceptional on these tapes. I know that the trend is changing and these tapes are going the way of the 8-track (and I'm trying to slowly make the change over to digital media) but in the meanwhile..I can highly recommend this Maxell 4-pk for your vcr recording needs.Also-this vendor appears to be a fine one.	10
I was thrilled to get this charger and it does charge in record time, but after intense use over the last month, it has started 'dying' on me and not charging my kindle. I have to fiddle with it to get it charging again. That is a problem as so much of my business is done on the kindle. This could be just a defective one. That happens with any product. I would suggest giving the product a try and sending it back if it doesn't work right. I'm holding out, but might be returning it if it doesn't improve.	14
Haven't used Avery labels for quite some time; however, since i recently became treasurer of our HOA, it's my duty to mail dues requests twice a year - labeling envelopes is never fun, but decided to try these labels... in the past, picking the label off the sheet was a wearisome, repetitive task... but now, with Avery's redesign of its label sheets, a quick two folds of the printed sheet of labels, and label edges pop up - making the job of peel-and-place a *lot* easier! Good job, Avery!	17
This digital tire gauge drains battery even if you are not using it.I checked my tires once a month, but, I already have to change battery about once per year.The gauge still use power to memoris the pre-setting of tire pressure. come to think about it, thepre-set memory is useless if you have 2 different cars. (Because it only can memoris one front and one back tire setting). The 2032 lithiumX2 battery is not cheap, I expect it should last at least 5 years.	2
We love playing pit together with our international friends. It is a fun game to play when folks do not have a lot of language in common. I also gave this as a gift to an international student and it has been used and enjoyed! Be aware, thought, that this is a loud game! So it is not a good choice when you want to have quiet interaction. But if you don't mind shouting, some rowdiness and hysterical laughter, this is your game. All in all a great group game!	22
When I considered returning the compass for smaller ones, I learned that Amazon does not accept returns for this item due to hazardous material regulations.  Not a problem in my case, but thought you'd all want a heads-up before purchasing.I purchased a few of these as additions to emergency kits I built for friends/family (see my Listmania lists).  I planned to make the kits out of Nalgene bottles, but the compass is a little too wide to fit, so instead I made the kits out ofMTM Survivor Dry Box with O-Ring Sealwhich worked out better anyway.	20
I have wanted one of these forever. This one is really sturdy and has a good, soft, easy to hold grip. I haven't used it for baking ( scraping) yet, but I used it for chopping. I prefer my chef's knife for more precise chopping/dicing but this tool is handy for quick chopping of celery, onions, nuts, etcetera. I imagine the edge could be sharpened to make it more effective as a chopper. The size of the blade makes it nice for swooping up the chopped material for transfer to the pan.	13
I chose this toy for a 6 year old grandson.  His father and I got it working and he had a wonderful time playing with it.  (So did his dad and I.)  I worked as a programmer and debuggermost of my working life, and it was really fun to get it programmed!  Watching him figure out how to get it to do different things was so much fun.I think that most kids who are computer efficient and know how to program could handle it without adult assistance.  It's a very nice toy and so far, hasn't broken!I recommend it highly.	22
When I lived in Sweden, about 50% of the population had these headphones. They were extremely popular. Now I know why!The sound quality on these things is amazing, comparable to $50+ headphones. The only headphones I have listened to so far that have better sound quality are some more expensive Sennheiser headsets. The bass is really booming, and there is crisp treble and pretty nice midrange.They are extremely portable too. I can fit them in the pockets of my shorts when folded up.Pretty durable cable too, and it doesn't twist.I highly recommend these!	10
This tool surprised me.  It is made extremely well, I can't over-state this.  This will fit 99.9% of all oil filters, and there is no struggling with other types of tools/wrenches.  It has a spring mechanism where you simply put a ratchet on this and it self fits to any size filter.. and you twist.  Great grip,.. best wrench I've ever used and being universal mean you never need to swap out for another for any other vehicles/tractors, etc.  This replaces a dozen other tools.	2
I have problems with thinning hair.  I have been using this product for about a month.  I do believe that it has helped to make my very thin hair a bit thicker.  I don't expect miracles from a shampoo, but I'm happy with the results I've gotten from this product.  I like the fact that it's natural and leaves my hair feeling clean.  The scent is a bit medicinal, but by the time I use my other styling products I don't really notice it anymore. If you have a problem with thinning hair I'd give this product a try.	4
I have a 3 year old english/american bulldog mix that loves chewing on nylabones/dingos. I bought this product selfishly, because I like dinosaurs. Unfortunately, the littel nubs tore into her gums like nobody's business and left sharp shards sticking out. She only had it for a short time under (sort of laxed) supervison, but when i looked down the thing's entire tail was covered in blood. Into the trash it went. Moving forward, I will stick to the non-nubby nylabones.	19
"The more Bigas Luna I watch, the less I think of him.  The actors in this movie are not to be blamed for the mess.  He is.  Basically, his premise does not lead to the ""willing suspension of disbelief"" that is key to any good narrative.  Besides, in this day and age, movies about mass killings in movie theaters are no longer funny or  original.  They reflect the grim reality of our gun-obsessed country,  Luna definitely does not succeed in whatever it was he tried to do.  Watch instead ""The Devil's Backbone"". A waste of my time.  Let it not be a waste of yours."	15
I wanted a chair with a removable bowl, but now that I've seen my son grab it and attempt to dump it out, part of me wishes I'd have gone for a toilet adapter style.If this is the style you want though, it's durable and sleek in appearance (for a potty chair, anyway).ETA: OK, now I'm glad that the bowl is removable as we're using it more, but you do have to watch for spills. It cleans easily and my son finds it comfortable.	3
"Having come of age in the 80s, I still list Sam Kinison as my favorite comedian.  Even so, now with a family of my own I welcome comedy that I don't have to hide from my daughters or cringe when they overhear.  Brian Regan is just such a comedian.  If you love comedy based on language (as opposed to stories, observations, etc.) then this album is also for you.  And, as a bonus, your children can listen to it along with you, with the strongest word used on the CD being ""hell."""	6
I bought this for my dad along with extra lancets and a 51 pack test strip pack. I havent had him use it yet, but I researched a lot online about glucometers and this seems like the best one available with easy to use features. It comes with a great looking classy carrying case in which one can store the lancets, softclix device, the meter, the solution and the test strip drum. It comes with a 17 test strip drum, a softclix device, ten lancets, carrying case, solution and complete manuals.	12
I will make this real short and sweet..If you like Agatha Christiyou will love all the Poirot..I do and have watched them manytimes over..they are wonderfully scripted, being TRUE to the bookand David Suchet has captured her character perfectly.All the actors  perfectly cast and the era is historically correct inall aspects..There is a little of something for everyone and it's ashow  you can watch with or by all ages.  So get your popcorn, sit back andenjoy.  This is a class act and consistently so.	0
"I have had the 690 Porter Cable router for years and finally committed that one to a table. This is the same motor (without the speed control) but with the ""D"" handle. Loads of power, really convienent to use. I find that I don't use the speed control all that much. Woodcraft offered the Porter Cable 892 kit as a replacement for this one. The guy said that Porter Cable quit making these. But this one is half the price and actually meant to be used one handed. A fine tool. BTW they still make it."	21
This tea was very good, however the mild flavor got boring after drinking it for a long period of time. Drinking it sporadically would probably be best. It is a very nice tea for right before bed, and does not need sugar or honey for a nice flavor. I would order it again, however I think my 6 boxes will keep me well stocked for a very long time. My favorite tea from yogi is the Cocoa Spice, which I suggest to everyone as it has a nice deep flavor and can be taken with or without milk.	11
"We bought this Maxell Audio Head Cleaner to clean our tape heads on our tape cassette player (which is now obsolete being that it was created and used by us in the dinosaur age). It performed exactly as described. It cleaned up the audio heads quite nicely...the music doesn't sound muffled or unclear. Now we can play and listen to the oldies of our time the way we used to. If you own a ""retro"" tape cassette player, then by all means, get this audio head cleaner, it'll make it as good as new. Great product, highly recommend."	10
I have been using Olay Regenerist daily serum for 2 years now and I am very impressed.  For an inexpensive product it worked much better then expensive ones.  It goes on velvety smooth and in the morning when I wake up my face glows with a nice radiance.  It brightened under my eyes and made my face shine.  I tried other products to see if they would measure up to Regenerist but none did, they weren't even close.  I would recommend this product to anyone wanting a smooth youthful glow.	4
I bought mine a few months ago but only took them like 10 times or so. I only tried these because of the Rave reviews on here & I must say Im disappointed. Not only are they WAY TOO BIG, and have to take 2 which makes it a choir to take, a forgetful one at that; but they dont really do much at all for me. It generally doesnt make me feel noticeably calm, relaxed, energized or anything. I expected so much better. Ill stick to my oneaday.	12
"I read a few negative reviews about this corkscrew that are critical of the build quality.  I have to respectfully disagree.  I'm not sure exactly what type of polymer it's made of, but it's not ""cheap plastic"".  Yes, it's very lightweight and made of something not metal, but whatever it's made of is very strong and durable.  The screw literally glides into the cork like a hot knife through butter and because the corkscrew is so lightweight all of your energy goes into removed the cork instead of balancing a heavy corkscrew.  I love it."	13
Suitable for adults and young adults. This is not a Lord of the Flies rehash. Mike and his friends are left to fend for themselves when the camp administrator and all but one counselor fail to return from a trip to the nearest town. The remaining counselor has a mental breakdown as they discover a dangerous fog trapping the coed camp of teenagers high atop a remote section of the Sierra Madras. As the group struggles to survive they learn the greatest danger to their safety may be the other humans trapped atop the mountain.	14
...until you hear the entire intro to 'walk on by' you aint heard nothin!!!! how many albums do you know of that play for a full two minutes before you even hear the artists' first words?!?! and i dont care how shaky brother ike seems in his intro for 'by the time i get to phoenix' that is still some phat stuff... it might start slow, but ends tight as hell...'one woman' is good and erbody and they mama done sampled 'hypo..hippo...hypobobolistic....' TRACK #TWO!!!! (yall know what i was tryin ta say!)...but if you scurred say you scurred....	9
Khalil Gibran's book, The Prophet, has the power to transform the darkest feeling of pain in your heart into great release. What a blessing that it exists. Each passage touches on a deep and universal topic (marriage, friendship, etc).  The words, spoken profoundly and clearly from the mouth of the mystic and insightful prophet, who has nothing but words of wisdom to impart to those who gather around him, is a truly life affirming and transformative experience.  Please read this today. It will give you insight on the sacred aspects of all life choices and experiences that exist in the world.	5
I haven't used this a lot yet, but, based on my fairly small sample of experience, this product is a lot stronger than other mounting tape I've tried.  We used it putting up posters at a fundraising event and it did an outstanding job - even on a brick wall.  It gripped the wall and the posters very well.  It didn't take a great deal of length to hold bulky and moderately heavy posters.  Pretty much exactly what you're looking for from a product like this.	17
I've loved these flavorful almond flavored (apricot seed) aromatic cookies for decades. These inimitable Lazzaroni treats are delicious with tea, coffee, or alone, in cold weather or hot. They imbue an extra bit of pleasure to viewing the abundant delights ofTwo Fat Ladiesenjoying life and food with humor and gusto. The attractive Italian tin happens to be a very useful decorative object for goody-storage. We appreciate that these cookies ship well even in hot weather, and they arrive unbroken, protected by the tin. When you open the lid, a scent like amaretto liqueur wafts up. Enjoy!	11
The diaper champ is such a great product.  I keep it in my baby's bedroom in a corner and it has never produced any foul odors.  I love that I can use regular trash bags with it.  I only have to empty the bag once every 2 weeks (since most of the diaper changes happen downstairs).  But, even going that long, it does not smell.  I would never use one that required refills, what is the sense in that when this one works perfectly?!	3
"Got one of these mounted in my vehicle. Seems to have a quality build and a ok mount. Makes install a little easier, just remember that you'll have to get to this ASAP is something does happen so mount it somewhere you'll be able to get to even if you're upside down. ( Hopefully never ) This is just another one of those ""just incase"" tools that you carry and hope you never need. But better to have it and not need it, then to need it and not have it."	2
"Wow, this tv series on sci-fi is amazing! Love it, love it, love it! I ordered the third season on ""instant video"" because I was so anxious to continue watching it and couldn't wait but I will be sure to purchase all complete seasons on dvd. And I hope that there are many seasons to come. Excellent story plots, fantastic performance from cast, and amazing effects in addition to the scenery...Haven is a beautiful place even if these supernatural events keep happening...the panorama for all the scenes is breathtaking!"	0
Starting with the hope that comes when one possesses beauty and innocence, our character travels through experiences that slowly change her over time and bring out a wide range of emotions in those of us who are watching. The setting was dreary though and the times were depressing for all but the very rich. Tess exhibited courage, suffered abuse, rage, and tragedy. Was she a sympathetic figure or a villain? It's all there, beautifully produced and skillfully acted. It's difficult to watch this story without examining and reexamining the flaws and virtues of each character. I found this a very believable story as presented.	15
"I just finished watching this DVD. IT SUCKS! I thought it was the TV Special. It was Alice Cooper's concert for the album. The video is bad. So is the audio. The cover says it's ""REMASTERED"". If this is remastered. I'd hate to see the original. If you're looking for the actual TV Special, look for the one that is under 120 minutes AND does not include his hits from the previous years as this disc does. SHAME ON RHINO FOR GIVING US THIS CRAP!"	6
When I bought code: veronica i was an amateur with resident evil game, but after playing two discs of resident evil pleasure, i can beat any resident evil game. Gaming is my profession, so the game wasnt too hard to beat for me, but it would be, on a scale of 1-10, the hardness is an 8, for average gamer, so be resident evil experienced befor you buy this great game, but other than that, the game is excellent, so the $$ doesnt matter, the game play is worth it!	23
With all the tablets and apps out we don't really need EReaders anymore.  I am not exactly sure why I wanted a e reader.  I mean,  I have a iPod, iPad, Kindle, Regular Nook,  iPad Mini,  iPhone, Blackberry Playbook.I decided to sell my Kindle Fire and my previous Color nook tablet and upgrade to the snow nook HD and its beautiful,  it also has google apps on here now so we can get a lot of android apps, including the AHEM// Kindle app.I like the nook friends and borrowing books options as well as how clean the OS is.	10
Being a long time Star Wars fan, this was a hilarious film.  If you  haven't seen it I would recommend it to any one who has grown up with Star  Wars.This was well directed for an independant short film.  You can see  how all of the people in the movie could have been inspirations for George  Lucas.This is not a spoof of Star Wars, but rather a spoof of  &quot;Shakespeare in Love&quot;, with a Star Wars theme to it.I give  this one two thumbs up.	15
Duracell 9 volts are the only batteries I use in the wireless microphones we use for our instructional video business. We replace the batteries before every shoot and sometime run for up to 10 hours non-stop. Wireless microphones use a lot of power and we have found that the Duracell batteries can make it through an entire day of shooting, lasting about 25% longer than the less expensive generic types we tried before.We also use Duracell 9 volts in our smoke detectors at home. They might be more expensive than some, but they are worth it in the long run.Highly recommended!	12
I feed birds all winter and the sparrows, cardinals, finches, etc. - all come to eat.  In past years water that wasn't ice was the one thing they needed to sustain them.  I bought this to use in a birdbath so that my birds could drink, as well as, eat all winter.  It's very economical to use and the birds think it's just a rock at the bottom of the bird bath.  I'm very pleased with this item.  I would recommend it to anyone interested in keeping our &#34;feathered friends&#34; going over the winter.	18
Great Graphics and lots of options for display and play settings make this one a keeper.  Most other Solitaire apps are either very low graphic quality or paid app with too much excess stuff included.  This nice app has ads but they are on left side of screen where they do not bother at all on my Xoom tablet.  I got this app to replace a Solitaire App by &quot;Mobility&quot; that has now added some OBJECTIONABLE ADS for Dating sites, etc.  Luckily I found that  ODESYS has done a nice job with this app.	1
I don't bake much anymore, I live alone and am diabetic so making a batch of brownies (mmm brownies) would not be a good thing, since I could easily eat an entire batch myself in a few days. I do chop a lot of veggies, though and this thing works great for transferring them to the pot/pan without losing them to the floor in the process. It is a sturdy little thing, I've had it around 8 years and it's had many many trips through the dishwasher in that time and held up nicely. Highly recommended!	13
This has to be the best value in my shop.  I used two spiral 4&quot; connectors on the inside of the lid to connect to hoses outside. These spiral connectors let the hoses pivot.  I don't disconnect the hoses but use 4&quot; adaptors to hook to hoses from each machine.I've filled up a 33 gallon trash can three times and haven't had to empty the dust bags on my Jet vacuum yet.But, even better, I can vacuum up all those little scrap pieces of wood and stuff and not wince everytime they hit my blades.	21
"A friend loaned me this book and told me it was one of the best she'd ever read.  Then she said, in a voice just above a whisper, ""It's about the circus."".  To be honest, that didn't intrigue me at all.  But right from the start I was hooked and finished the book in two days, then re-read it a couple of days later to my husband.  This is a book I will read over and over again just because of the beauty of the characters and the fascinating facts about the depression-era circus."	5
I had this game when I was young and it has been around for years now. You could be forgiven for dismissing the game as a silly bit of fun but a large part of the point of this is setting up the game. This requires kids to test their dexterity, physical and mental, as well as consider some early notions of scientifc principles; logic, physics, probability etc.I think it's fab for developing young brains while the have lot's of fun and barely realise you are taxing their grey cells!	22
Pros: Works well as a battery, probably has enough charge to last my GalaxySIII through 2-3 days of extra charging w/o having to recharge the deviceitself. Small size/lightness makes it extremely portable/pocketable.Smooth and attractive exterior design. Feels sturdy enough in my hand.Laser pointer and LED light are both bright and have good range when tryingit out in a dark room.Cons: Its a bit tricky switching between battery on/off, laser, and LEDlight. Its not as intuitive as I would like (maybe its just me), but as a bundle device, it worksfine. The on/off button feels a bit flimsy.	7
Very, very funny, with the clever twist of having intelligent trolls that are a part of a functioning society.  My wife (whose Amazon account I am hacking since I do not have one of my own) starting downloading Tuttle's books on the Kindle and we are both in the process of flying through the entire catalogue.  This is one of the funnier books that I have read in a long time, set in a fantasy world that does not conform to the normal archetypes of the various creatures normally found in such worlds.  Get this story and enjoy it.	14
This is simply the best of the Jackson Five and then some! Ths set and &quot;Pre-History, The Lost Steeltown Recordings&quot; are all the J-5 you'll ever need! The unreleased material is quite good (better than most of what is actually released these days)! &quot;Let's Have A Party&quot; perfectly captures the atmosphere of a 1970s afterschool dance party. &quot;It's Your Thing&quot; (with the incredibly sexy female background singers) is amazingly funky! &quot;Can't Get Ready For Losing You&quot; sounds like a first cousin to Boby Womack's &quot;I Can Understand It.&quot; J-5 fans rejoice!	9
I purchased this crib after my son grew out of his Graco travel lite crib (at three months). My son is four months old now and fits in it perfectly and there is still a lot of room for him to grow. It is a nicely made crib and is worth the $80 that it costs. It is so cute and I love the fact that they sell a bedding set for it. We bought the malawi set for it, which looks adorable. I wish I would have gotten this crib from the begining.	3
I agreee with just about every positive thing previously written about this record.  This is a great album - a 'must have'.However, be warned.  The production is TERRIBLE.  Even on the remastered version it doesn't sound much better the Earthbound (the live King Crimson album on which the production was so bad that Fripp says he'll never reissue it.)  Since Crimson was such a powerful live band, other recordings of this period are preferable.  Recommended: The Nightwatch, The Great Deceiver, or others available though Fripp's private label, Discipline Global Mobile.	6
I don't understand why they can't take less filler in these products and add more product.  Why does it take 6 pills to equal 5gr Creatine?  This could be accomplished in 3.  So you think you're getting a deal with 180 pills when you're only receiving 30 days worth of product.  I've decided to seek my protein and creatine in one supplement.  A powder with what I want/need.  I don't think the price for a 30 day supply is justifiable in 180 pills.  Just my opinion.	12
I've used this to spray a lot of shrubs and trees.  It's a good size.  If it were bigger, it would be heavier than I'd like.I found that when this tank is completely full, one can't pump much pressure since there's nowhere for the air to go.  As it the level goes down, it gets easy to pump enough pressure into it.I like the spray handle.  It seems perfect for something this size.  I appreciate the low price at the time of my purchase.	18
With the fine threading it may be stronger but doubt that this feature will make a difference. The split washer is chrome plated which is a mistake as the chroming weakens the washer and a piece off the end cracked off when I first attached the ball to a hitch.The directions state that the nut should be torqued to 450 ft. lbs. which is likely to be an error. Hard to even find a torque wrench that goes up to 450 foot lbs. much less someone who could tighten the nut to that specification without a 4 foot cheater bar.	2
Now that I've gone back and started replaying Diablo, I realize how spoiled I've become playing Darkstone. Major improvements were made the the Diablo engine by GOD when they put this game out, and Diablo actually feels somewhat kludgy in comparison. Ability to change camera angle, the Previously Visited Places menu, that sort of thing. GOD/Take 2 did a good job with the patches, as well, not only fixing some D3D problems in the original version but adding playability as well. A fine product overall that's still got me banging away at monsters after months of single-minded playing.	23
This is Gibran's most celebrated work and it is so with goodreason.  It is a profound insight and expose into the human characterand the emotions that work within the heart and soul.  Humble words,seared with the heights and depths of love and of pain, this is a life-changing arrangement of words.  If I had to sum the book up in one word, it would be &quot;SUBLIME.&quot; If you're picking up this title, be sure to order Gibran's 'The Beloved' to go along with it. These are books that deserve a worthy and permanent place on your bookshelf.	5
The story of the game with it accompanying video sequwnces make the gamer feel as though they are almost playing a movie.  THis is just one of the great elements of Metal Gear Solid.  Another thing that makes this game unique is that instead of just running around and shooting every enemy that comes your way, you instead must rely on stealth if you're to be successful.  Finally, the most rewarding aspect of this game is it's near perfect gameplay, which is about as faultless as a game can get.  THis is one of the must have games for Playstation.	23
At first you wonder how the different story lines will tie together.  It is subtle and not shoved in your face, but with time the viewer sorts it out. Believable, tragic and hopeful story line.  The acting was top drawer. The setting is unusual and interesting.  Jennifer Lawrence plays the main role as a teenager and Charlize Theron plays her as a grown woman.  There is a bit of a Capulet and Montague family feud going on, which is actually understandable in this case, which dooms the young romance.	0
I was spending $25-30 every month for a very conservative bikini wax. Four months ago I spent $12 on this product and haven't looked back. It's very easy to use, nontoxic, and, best of all, very easy to clean up. Unlike wax, this just washes away with a wet washcloth. I'm not sure I'd want to home wax with a wax-based product, because I'd be worried I'd ruin my linens. Not so with this. I can see what other reviewers mean that it's so easy, it makes you want to wax it all!	12
This was my second disc from Audio Fidelity that I bought and I was blown away again by the clarity, sound stage and punch from this nearly 40 year old recording. I have bought 2 other discs by Music Fidelity and am very pleased with all of them. There is another company that has been remastering discs for a couple of decades which recently have been releasing mediocre remasters. I feel that Audio Fidelity is doing a far better job and they have a great selection of music. I will be getting more of these	9
For a two dimentional game, you won't find one better. This game has a great storyline, exceptional graphics, awesome sound effects, yada, yada, yada........you will not regret playing this game even if you don't play games that often. This game will hook you within the first ten minutes. The only thing that could prove me wrong is if you don't want to take the time to read what some of the articles actually do once you pick them up. You have to constantly decide what to wear and what to use.	23
Hemingway is one of the best known authors worldwide and with good reason. As someone with limited knowledge of European history and a complete ignorance of the events of the Spanish Civil War, this had me engrossed and wanting to learn more. It had me so engrossed that I nearly wanted to go join a rebel movement and dedicate myself to war a la Robert Jordan.This book has the vital ingredients of sex and war and mixed together with Hemingway's unbelievably creative writing style, makes for one of the best works of fiction of all time.	5
"I first won a 5-pound can of Nupro at a collie specialty show. The person who donated the gift commented, ""This stuff will grow hair on eggs!"" Funny. But I've used it for several years ever since that first can, and my collie's coat is gorgeous. This is a great product. My dog is 9-1/2 yrs old, looks about 4, and acts like a puppy. (You can see him at [...].) I won't stop adding this to his food."	19
We have sensors for temperature and humidity in our attic.  We found that regular batteries do not work well in the cold of Maine winters. Buy these Lithium batteries has made a huge difference. The extra cost is absorbed by their longevity.Here's my TIP on those attic sensors or transmitters: TIP: I did find it best to purchase and use &#34;Energizer Ultimate Lithium&#34; AA cells. Not only do these last longer but are not really affected by the hot or freezing temperatures found in attics (and you don't need to climb up there to replace batteries every couple of months).	12
O. M. G!!!!!! Ok, so, like I wanted to like, see if this thing like, actually, like, worked, ya know? So, I like, killed my brother, and I like, turned on the ghost radar thingy. And, like, OMG OMG OMG! It, like, only showed like, one dot thingy, and it was like, my brother! And, like, it showed all the like, words and stuff, and like, he was like, saying stuff like &quot;Omg&quot; &quot;Why&quot; &quot;Hate&quot; &quot;You&quot; &quot;You&quot; &quot;Did&quot; &quot;For&quot; &quot;Stupid&quot; &quot;App&quot; &quot;So&quot; &quot;Stupid&quot; &quot;Hate&quot; &quot;I&quot; &quot;cant&quot; &quot;believe&quot; &quot;you&quot; OMG OMG OMG!!!!	1
We bought a dedicated photo printer for our preschool.  Epson XP-600.  It was smallish and held photo paper in its trays.  It took us a while to dial in on the right paper for the Airprint from our iOS devices.  This Premium paper did the trick.  Ultra Premium was too shiny and did not look right.  Kodak and HP paper did not work at all.  Neither did the cheaper stuff.  When the price is right here on Amazon, stock up!!!	17
The Airzooka is a rather large toy that launches a blast of air up to 20' or so. We gave this to my son for Christmas and it turned out to be a surprise hit! The Airzooka was a little hard for my son to assemble on his own, but he was eventually able to get it.Everyone (young and old) had a lot of fun playing with this toy and the cats soon learned to go upstairs when anyone picked it up (Note: No animals were harmed in the writing of this review :-)Recommended!	20
"For the girlie-girl who loves imaginative play with fashion design, arts and crafts, etc. THIS is the toy for you!There's hours and hours of play here, producing all the fun little outfits that you can imagine you'll be wearing yourself. And, like all great projects, creativity begets more creativity ... and the sky is the limit when you get into that ""zone."" There's no end to what your imagination can produce.Luckily, the Klutz company web site can provide you with more papers for these great projects! Every girl I've given this to has adored Paper Fashions."	22
I used this during the day for a couple months in conjunction with the Q10 night cream and it seemed to help soften the wrinkles I had started to notice.  Doesn't aggravate my acne prone skin and I like this lotion better than the night cream since the consistency is light and absorbs well and the smell is very minimal (plain suntan/lotion smell).  Works fine under my makeup.  Would be great if they offered it with a slightly higher spf to last just a bit longer (since I don't reapply over my makeup).	4
"I bought ""Magic Rub"" by Sanford, White Pearl, also by Sanford, and these Mars erasers and tested them all on ordinary writing paper to see which would be best.  This removed the marks with the least pressure, without smudges, and left the least eraser residue.I also use tracing paper quite a bit to transfer images for soft-block carvings, and this eraser does an excellent, clean job.So while it is unfortunately the most expensive of the latex-free erasers I tested, it is the best and worth purchasing."	17
These are fine for standard, thin power cords.  We have had one in place that the kids have never dislodged despite two years of trying.  But they will not close over the heavy, thick cords like those for microwaves, computers, or power bars.  We finally ended up attaching ours to the wall with duct tape to cover those cords.I am giving this three stars because it does work fairly well for thin cords, and because I have yet to see anything better out there.  My advice?  Invest in duct tape.	3
"I bought this set for a 13 year old girl who is a friend of the family because she loves fashion. She spent the afternoon putting together a fashion line. The ribbons, sequins, beads, and ""fabrics"" (paper) come in such a large variety of lovely choices I couldn't resist joining in. This would be an excellent gift for an older child in the hospital, travelling, or simply to pass a rainy weekend. There is so much paper included and choices with the stencils that this book provides a great deal of playtime."	22
This product is totally amazing.  It allows me to extend the life of my adhesive bra so I get many more wearings than I would have.I don't like bra straps or strapless bras so i use these adhesive cups. After a few wearings the adhesive wears off.  I apply this adhesive to my skin and the cups adhere  without any pulling or stretching of the skin.  It''s also great for  your tops to keep from revealing too much cleavage.  The price  and the product is great.  I will certainly be purchasing more when I need it.	4
I loved this book.  The characters are quirky but lovable and the action is non-stop. Add in a satirical look at current culture, some funny references to sci-fi TV, and characters out of a Hiiassen novel, and you have a winning combination for entertaining reading.  I am so looking forward to the author's next book.Be aware that there are few errors throughout the book where the wrong words are used in places.  Finding these was a pain but the book is funny enough to make you forget these little miscues.	14
"These Avery labels do exactly what they're supposed to.They feed perfectly, are perfectly spaced on the label sheet, are easy to peel and position.For those not familiar with how easy these Avery labels work:You simply open a Word DocumentClick on Tools; then Envelopes and LabelsSelect Avery Label 5160Type in what you want on the labeland print.In a couple of seconds you have great-looking labels.  I use them as return address labels, because this size is ""taller"" than many and allows an extra line or two on the label.Really!--you won't be diaappointed--these labels live up to the Avery reputation."	17
I bought this because I thought I needed a heavier night cream, but its a little too heavy for my face as I have oily/combination skin.  If you are dry/combination or dry and need that extra moisture, this would be an excellent product for you.  I use it on my neck only and it works wonders for that, but when I use it on my face, I have a few whiteheads in the morning.  Still a good product as most of the Olay line has proven to be.	4
I generally do a lot of research and digging before I make a tool purchase.  This has allowed me to build a collection of tools which I am extremely happy with.  This clamp is the exception.  I bought a pair of  these based on the makers name and price.  I shouldn't have.  The  &quot;bar&quot; on these bar clamps is flimsy.  I bent one of mine the very  first time I used it.  I would never buy another one of these.	21
For the price, you can't beat it. Mine didn't come with any of the screws for the TV, but luckily I had some leftover from another mount so I didn't want to bother returning it. Also, not sure what they mean by tilt, but mine doesn't. The arm extends in and out as said, tv swivels left to right, but does not tilt up and down as was my expectation. Otherwise, can't beat it for the price as in Target/Best Buy etc., these are going for $60+.	10
Nick Drake's final album, Pink Moon, was recorded over the span of two days.  Unlike his first two albums, which contained backing of strings, woodwinds and keyboards, Pink Moon is stripped down to bone.  Mr. Drake's expressive guitar takes center stage and the bleak arrangements feed the depressive lyrics.  The title has become famous thanks to its inclusion in a Volkswagon, but it is only one of many stellar tracks.  &quot;Things Behind The Sun&quot;, &quot;From The Morning&quot;, &quot;Road&quot;, &quot;Harvest Breed&quot; and &quot;Rise&quot; all contain dark, brooding, deep and thought provoking lyrics that show a man with clear inner demons.	9
I own this book in paperback- and spent more than what the on line/download price that's for sure. And what they are asking for now is about how much I think it's probably worth.It's not one I re-read. The stories go by so quick, there's no time to get involved in the characters or feel for them at all. The one story I halfway got into- the honeymoon/castaway story- I ended up wondering how things work out for them- wished it was it's own book.	14
Having a top is just part of childhood.  This one is a great beginning top. I love the fact that the top piece pops off if it is banged or bent so that the toy does not break, you just put it back together.  Our 11 month old and 2 year old grandchildren both delight in playing with this toy.  It is not as popular as their trucks, they are boys, but it is a great addition that helps children learn about force and motion and color mixing since when the top spins the colors merge.	22
This product burns my scalp and doesnt get rid of my dandruff.Ive tried cutting down my use of this product so that I wouldnt cause irritation to my scalp but Im deciding to give up on it because I dont need to be in pain when I wash my hair for no results anyway.I have contacted the company because I am that unsatisified with this product. Its a shame because I really love nuetrogena products and this is the only time that I have had an issue with something they make.	4
OEM quality, as mentioned, made in Japan.  The only gripe is the OEM cap has Honda screws that are have washer locks on them to keep them on the cap and thus less likely to drop while removing them.  The replacement screws are separate.  The cap also comes with a replacement gasket.TIP:  Always replace plug wires one at a time from the old cap to the new cap in the same order/rotation you pull from.May as well replace the rotor and coil while you are at it:Beck Arnley  173-7988  Ignition RotorOEM 5100A Ignition Coil	2
I enjoyed the book.I normally don't enjoy books written by male authors but this one was good.I really enjoyed Paul getting into the dating scene with all the crazy ladies.It was surprising that he fell in love with a blind woman, but it really worked in the story.And even him being blind for a few days worked wel in the story as well.*****SPOiLER*****I am not sure why Christina had to die, that was just a bit too much for me.But I did not spoil the book as a whole.	14
I was trying to replace a peel off mask I had in college over 10 yrs ago but couldn't remember the name; it left my face soft and it was easy to peel off and it didnt have a strong smell, but this product is the opposite. This product is messy to apply and thick, and it takes a long time to dry and I don't see a difference in my face when I take it off. I left it in the draw with all the other products I don't really use because they do nothing special. I mean really!!!	4
I have read tons of books, and this is one of the best books I've ever read! Imagine the concept of a hitch-hiking serial killer being picked up by a serial killer! It's hilarious! I've read all the versions and prequels and sequels that Kilborn and Crouch wrote about these characters, and let me tell you they are all great! They have some really twisted minds, and I love that. Kinda reminds me of myself lol. Keep it up you two, because I want to read more of your stuff! And don't ever hitchhike!!!	14
I purchased a set of these pens at Target roughly a week ago.When I am writing with this pen it has an inconsistent flow of ink, half way through a work it &#34;dries up&#34; the next work it runs dark, and repeats this process. I have tried both pens and have the same issue. Regardless if I use more/less pressure, change the angle, write on different paper.The pen writes poorly. Would not recommend or purchase these.Still searching for that perfect pen...	17
This did lift my medium brown hair to a yellow blonde. Which I toned down with a purple toner and now it is a lovely blonde.I left it in for 40 minutes after applying it to my hair. It took me about 20-25 minutes to complete the application so some areas of my hair had  60 minutes of contact with the product. That hair came out completely blonde. Next time I will leave it on a little longer.Left my hair in great condition in comparison to other brands I have tried.	4
I adore these headphones! I'm really hard on them and use the things almost daily. They get shoved into my bag, ripped out, tossed around, and stuff like that. Other than the time I stepped on one of the plastic sides and snapped it (but superglue fixed everything!) they're just the same as when I got them last year. I tried using the blue tabs to adjust how tight they are but didn't have any success. Bass and sound quality is superb. Whenever mine break I'm getting another pair!	10
I bought this to catch dust from a sliding compound miter saw.  By itself it gets about 40 percent of the dust.  I built a catch-box out of 1/4-inch plywood that employs the Big Gulp Hood as a funnel into the central dust control system.  The catch-box, which works, is probably 10 times the size (in area) of the Big Gulp.  Nothing as small as the Big Gulp is going to be as effective as it needs to be at any stationary tool that kicks dust in all directions.	21
This is good to have in stock when you need food but really don't want to make a big deal out of making food. I liked the taste of this stuff. But taste is a subjective thing, so what I like you may not. I would get some higher priced versions at your local store and make sure you like the taste. Food has a way of exciting or terrorizing ones taste buds. But at this price, if you like the taste it can not be beat as a source of sustenance. Which after all is the point to eating.	11
I just purchased this device, and use it with a Motorola V365 cell phone (AT&T). Although the quality of the sound may not equal that of your land line phone, or maybe even your cell phone under ideal conditions, it is excellent.  The people with whom I have spoken say that I sound fine, and I am pleased with how they sound. There is absolutely no issue with the volume. Based on my experience, I am comfortable saying that for the price,  you will be very happy with the Blue Ant.	7
If you have not purchased the original version, you're in luck because you can now get all of the spectacular add-ons for the same price as the original game.  One of the best computer games I have ever played.  If you  like Warcraft or Age of Empires, you'll love Starcraft.  The aspect that  surprised me the most in this game were the scenario and video segments in  between levels.  Some of the best computer animated film I've ever seen.  Definitely worth the price considering how long the game remains fun,  original and challenging.	23
Has the usual (very slight) fade after 5 months, BUT it is not very noticeable I only mention it because I notice everything (live in SB,Cali and we get moisture/sun every day). The material is thick and sturdy...I bought this for my 48-50 inch grill so it would fully cover the sides and it is working out great. Cover would get 4.5 stars but I rounded down due to the color of green being slightly different, to me, that what it looks like in the photos. Will update after a full summer if it holds up and doesn't crack, then bump up to 5 stars.	18
It is what it says it is, does what it says it does. It is non-glare, which is important to me when I am flipping through a ton of pages. It is top loading - I don't actually understand why they would make side or bottom loading, I would think they would just fall out too easily. And, they are page protectors. This brand is fairly thick, does not tear easily in my experience, and I have purchased I think three of the 200 count boxes so far. I need more, and I will buy them again.	17
I find it hard to give Amazon my money when the shopping experience is so frustrating. The app can't filter by price, by free shipping, by ratings.. I can see my order history and tracking, which is good, but there's no link to the items so I can reorder or write a review. Clicking on the &quot;full site&quot; link sorta works, except as soon as you click on a link, it reverts to mobile. I usually give up and don't end up buying what I was looking for, so I'm calling this app a failure.	1
After surgery: a must have.On a hot day, getting sweat off after doing a bit of housework, or for washing off dusty feet or even mud on arms, perfect. It's not a shower, but sometimes this is the quickest and quite good enough.I've never heated them, but I may be this winter as am having another surgery and it will be a cold recovery in the winter in CA. Usually I'm in a much hotter year-round climate where I always have a package going.I buy them in bulk, so that rates 5 stars.	12
"This Book is funny and is full of B words, like ""big brown bear, blue, bull, beautiful baboon....""  Another B phrase is added each time so by the end it's a long phrase.  There is a surprise at the end for a sad Baby Bird.  (my daughter dictated that paragraph)This isn't Berenstain Bear family book, with Mama, Papa, Sister and Brother but is a celebration of an important letter.  It's fun to read out loud with a swingy feel to it."	5
Acting was good, but the plot was stale and the theme lacked attention grabbing effect. The &#34;theme&#34; gave just Too much detail with the &#34;problems&#34; of everyone!The personal crap got in the way of the plot and made the plot secondary.  If you ever watched a weekday soap-box show, then this movie format was an exact copy!  Very disappointing.  The actors were better than this and their talents never really supported the plot.  Very generous on my part with a &#34;3-star rating&#34;.	0
This book is so beautifully illustrated and easy to follow. It helps you to understand the Zoku better. It might have been even better if they made the recipe units for different sized molds. These recipes produce too much for a single mold unit. It would have been nice if they used a matrix for the ingredients like on a box of rice. I am just math lazy and bought a single mold Zoku. Dividing 3/4 of a cup, 3 tablespoons or 3 1/2 tablespoons is kind of dicey in my kitchen.	13
I totally agree with the Agitated Reviewer.Justin probably has only another 5-10 years of life left and this happens.What must Stevie have been thinking off? Back in 1973 when he made this album Justin had been doing this kind of stuff 10-15 years before him.Also the good thing about Justin is the way he keeps his young appearance. If I look like him when I'm 70 I'll be a happy man. I know this is all history now but its about time someone like the Agitated Reviewer told the true undistorted facts.	9
This did a great job of cleaning my cats. It isn't too thick, easily works into the fur, gets rid of bad smell, etc. The only issue is I am not smelling any scent from it, their fur just smells like cat. That could be a good thing, especially since it shows how well it is working at getting rid of odor rather than simply masking it, but personally I like my cats to have a fresh scent after a bath. I will continue using this though since it does work so well.	19
This game is phenominal to say the least.  It is very fun and was the first RTS game i've ever played once a friend introduced me to it.  It is so much fun to play and very addicting.  The only reason I sold it is because not many people play online, and the ones that do will take you out in a heartbeat and the single player missions go by pretty fast.  This game would be incredibly fun to play at a LAN Party but I never went to one yet.	23
In all honesty, I think this trap would kill any small rodent (squirells, chipmunks, small rabbits) as well as rats, so be cautious where you place this.  We have it in out well pump house - where we also store animal feed.  So far, it's taken out one - using the Tomcat Mouse Attractant gel as bait.  Super heavy duty trap, I would suggest wearing gloves to spring load the trap after placing the bait on the tray.  Might save some nasty bruising to your fingers if the trap slips what setting.	18
This was my first book by this author and I got to say that I loved it.I liked the chemistry between jack and Alex I really didn't care for the age diffrence jack really was a sweetheart.Alex was a strong heroin with a big heart.the romance for me was good.the characters really communicated in this book . Unlike other romances where the main characters don't really communicate and let misunderstandings stand in their way in this novel the romance is true,at least for me.I recommend for readers that like suspense,spice,and romance .	14
This is my first time experimenting with jojoba oil and I really love it. This oil moisturizes my skin and scalp without feeling heavy or greasy. It absorbs really quickly and I'm comforted to know that it is USDA organic. My skin also remains moisturized all day after putting this product on in the morning. I am very sensitive to product odors and this oil carries a very very slight smell. However, it is not offensive at all and disappears after applying the product. I would definitely purchase this product again and recommend it to others.	4
An item you can do without. Before i bought this i would sit covered over a bowl of hot water. The benefit to having this product is that you can turn on the steam as soon as you need it. Still takes like 5 min for it to actually start steaming. Once you have your face in the bowl mask you can feel a bit insecure because if that thing splashes water on you it will burn you. The battery operated exfoliating brush (included) is loud and cheap. I dont use any of these things as much i thought i would.	4
I have an older version of this model, but it works great.  I opted to use more heavy weight wall anchors that I got from Home depot.  2 hangers rated to hold up to 75 lbs each equals 150 lbs worth of peace of mind!  The hanger itself that I bought was used, so it was already assembled, so I can't comment too much on the assembly process.  I bought 2 of them, and each holds my precious basses with tender care and worry-free security!  And no, I don't own stock in the company!  :-)	16
Buzz, my Anna's male hummer who has claimed my yard and this feederas his own, seems to like this feeder.  I have two now, I rotate them each weekas I clean, refresh them.  They are a bit hard to clean, I use a toothbrush to cleanthe feeder part.  The newer one is a bit different than the one I got a couple years ago,the perches don't seem as good, seem a bit short, but, it works so far.  Price is rightanyway, especially if you only have one or two hummers that use it.	18
Still works same as when I first bought it.  It's not a high-powered blower, and it will go thru the battery pretty quick, but if you want to just grab a blower to blow off your patio or driveway without dealing with cords or anything this is great.  I've got a ton of concrete around my front and back yards and two batteries does the trick.  If for some reason I want something really high-powered I will pull out the old corded blower, but it's rare.  My common use is blowing off sidewalks after mowing the grass.	18
Residing in my mind are the words of a true poet.  I was given the book THE PROPHET by my best friend when I was young.  It has followed me through my life and has filled me with the emotions and practical thought I needed to guide me through the smooth and rough waters of my life.  I gave this copy of Kahil Gibran's book to a young lady with the hope she will enjoy it the rest of her life.  Thank you Amazon for having this wonderful work of art available to all.	5
Its obviously some synthetic material, not cotton.  It does fray if you catch it on something, then it just starts to fall apart.  It is also very thin.  Barely put a drop of CLP on it and it soaks the entire patch.  Not a huge fan of these.  Ended up buying these:Butch'S Twill Cleaning Patches (Bag Of 375)(2-1/2-Inch).Now I only use these to wrap it around a nylon brush when I scrub down the inside of the bolt area of the rifle (when the BCG is removed).  Works ok for that.	20
If you're looking for a product that is both inexpensive and works well, this is it. It does exactly what it says it does.It's sort of a longer term solution. If you put it on at night it'll last for up to 72 hours, but for me usually wears off around the second day. Put it on every night, you'll never have a problem with sweating.This isn't scented, so if you're looking for scented stuff- you can use something else to put on in the mornings. This strictly only stops the sweating, and it's good at doing it.	12
"I found Permatex at Advance Auto and have been very pleased with it's performance.I used to use Devcon bulb grease for many years until I finished the tubeand could no longer find it locally.Besides the many great used for automobiles, this grease resolves problems with light bulbsin the house being hard to turn and or breaking off in sockets, and is perfect for oven light bulbs.It only takes a tiny bit each time, about 1/16"" bead of grease spread on the bulb threads.A tube (.33 oz) lasts a long time. If used for household only, probably several years!"	2
These gummies are the most delicious I have tasted. Compared to their American counterparts, these are practically the real fruit. Their flavor is fresh and bright, and they taste just like the real thing, but with that fun gummy texture.Kiwi is one of my favorites because, unlike many other candies, this flavor is subtle and not obnoxiously sweet. The seeds add a fun little crunch, and the hint of tanginess makes it taste more like the real fruit...though it could be tangier. They go fast because they are so good--I definitely recommend them!	11
This game is fairly short and can be beaten in a matter of ten minutes on the easy route, but it does provide other secrets and ways to go about the game.  You can go through three main paths, but you can quirk the paths if you decide to or if you screw up on one part of the level.  You definitely will find yourself going back trying to unlock the different multiplayer modes and trying to up your high score.  The rumble pack is worked very nicely into to the title.  The voices are also a nice added feature.  Buy this game guys.	23
This is the finest sander on the market.Virtually vibration free and no swirl marks. The PC 505 simply floats across the work surface. I actually look forward sanding my projects. I can use it for hours without the fatigue I experience with random orbit sanders and get a much better finish. As another reviewer noted it lacks dust collection. I'm not to impressed with any of the dust collection systems I've seen on other sanders anyway. Buy or build yourself a sanding table, and sand away. This is far and away the best power tool purchase I have ever made.	21
Obviously, this is something you want to keep out of the reach of children and pets (not to mention quite a few adults). While mouse traps can hurt if they snap on you, this thing would crush bones.It's easy to bait and set, has a metal pedal (which is fine), and works.My only suggestion? Since all rat traps are pretty much the same, and you're paying quite a bit for the convenience of shipping here, if you have access to one locally (a hardware store, etc), it would probably be significantly cheaper.	18
Not sure why, but I'm surprised more grocery stores don't carry this stuff.  No unpleasant aftertaste, and very low calorie.  Although it's only 70% as sweet as sugar, I started mixing it with some Nectresse (monk fruit and erythritol).  Nectresse is a lot sweeter than sugar, but it doesn't have any aftertaste either.  1 packet to about 2-3 tablespoons of erythritol makes it pretty much 1:1 sweetness of sugar.  I'll be getting more of this stuff.	11
I own 4 (now 5) Forrest blades.  There are NONE finer.  High quality, American made.  I will never buy another Freud blade or Home Depot/Lowe's special unless I'm cutting wet lumber or suspect wood (with old nails in it).  Forrest cuts finer, smoother bottoms, and cooler.  What's more, there's actually enough carbide on the teeth to have them sharpened.  These are not disposable blades by any measure.  They will turn your $200 contractor saw into a true woodworking machine.	21
Just because I only gave the game 3 stars doesn't mean this is a bad game, on the contrary, I LOVE this game, the only problem is with age of empires 2 and age of mythology out, I find it hard to go back and get the original, but it definatly is a fun rts and extremly user friendly at that (not overwheelming like some rts's start out) recommened for beginner rts fans but I'd buy the second one or age of mythology before this game.  If you get this game, do yourself the favor of getting the gold edition with everything together.	23
I bought this charger not for a Motorola but for a Dell Venue Pro (just another micro usb device) and it works perfectly, charges when in use, etc...The charger lights up blue when plugged in which I kinda like, if that sort of thing bugs you then don't get this charger, although the price is great and it does what it claims to. Definitely recommend.In addition to the Dell Venue Pro I can confirm that this charges the Lumia 900, Lumia 520, Lumia 928, and my current Lumia 1020. I'm still using this charger several years later. It works very well!	7
the smell, the smell, oh my god, the smell!!!!!! ok i had read the other reviews and i thought, &#34;how bad could it be&#34;.... can you say brainbusting headache bad!!!!, i had to leave it in front of an air purifier for DAYS!!! and it still had the aroma of a toxic waste dump... but in all seriousness the smell went away after about 7 to 10 days, &#34;or i just got used to it, lol,&#34; and it has made one of the best  ipad mini cases i have ever used... and i have used about 100..	7
I used this to flavor vegan sausages and the first time, I used it according to directions - adding about an ounce to a big batch (about 3 lbs. after cooking).  Barely-noticeable smoke flavor.  Second time, I used twice as much which caused me to have to adjust the other liquid ingredients in the mix but I was going for that authentic smokehouse flavoring.  A bit better, but I'm going to have to move on and find something with a little more 'kick'.	11
The sound is good with these headphones and I use them to watch movies and You Tube.  My only problem is that after awhile the ear pads start to bother my ears and I have to take them off. It would be nice if there was an adjustment not only for size, but for width. It would also be nice if there was a little padding at the top. Otherwise they are good for the price and they are not big and bulky, which was why I bought them in the first place.	10
"Most of us remember Henry Winkler in the role of Arthur ""The Fonz"" Fonzarelli on Happy Days. I took a chance on this. He's an even better actor than I remember. The story is set during the depression. Henry's character reposesses furniture rented from him by various poor families. Instead of ghosts, he has visions involving the people he's left destitute. Not sappy like some Christmas Carol renditions are. I was favorably impressed by the story as well as the acting. Gerard Parks (Doc from Fraggle Rock) was also in it, as was a young Dorian Harewood. A nice addition to my Christmas Carol collection."	15
I got this game because I  like the game yachtzee, but it is missing the excitement of actually rolling the dice. I also miss having an opponent. The sound effects are ok. What I do like is the quickness of each game. It is helpful too when it gives you hints about where to put your score. Makes for less thinking. I can whip out game after game, but it takes away from enjoyment. It's a good game to play if you are just trying to pass a few minutes of time. Glad it was free.	1
I found this watch for my husband probably 10 yrs. ago.  He is really hard on his watches being a mechanic.  He likes all the feature, backlight, timer, stop watch, alarm.  The band is the best, it has a strap that goes under the watch that helps to keep the pressure off the pins. It's Velcro so easy to remove when needing to quickly.  I only have to purchase new when he either scratches up the face to much or loses it like he did this time.	8
I played the old Mousetrap with the little mice to move around the game.  The only thing that I can see is different now is that they don't have little mice with tails.  Instead, they have mice characters that stand up and look more like people walking.  Our kids love it! (9 yr old, two-4yr old girls).  The 4 year olds are able to put on all the pieces.  I always supervise them, however, because I want the game to last and it is very breakable.	22
Classic album. One of my favorite of all time. This cd is so good that i feel like buyin it again, i just cant get enough of it. Every song is off the hook. From my personal favorite Ambitionz Az A Ridah to the hit single California Love. Most two Disc cd's that i own are usually just ok, but this one is a club banger. Its a shame that pac went so fast, he could of been a even bigger force than he was. Overall, I give this album 5 brickettes.	9
It works and has a low profile so that I can close the cigarette lighter door when it's not in use - two things I like.  My Android phone warns me to use the (Verizon) charger that came with the phone or charging will be very slow.  This may just be intrusive marketing by Verizon because the charger seems to work as well as any other and it keeps the phone charged when using it for GPS directions.  I have not used it for a tablet or iPad which requires more juice.	7
OXO makes good gear and this set of tongs is both comfortable and built well.  The plastic handle keeps the end from getting too hot when stirring pasta or other work where it's exposed to heat for a long time.I use this for frying, stirring, turning, tossing, grabbing, and find able to handle it all.  I have used these types of tongs for years, and the plastic handle is a nice addition.  So is the locking tab that keeps them closed for storage.  The smart additions make this gadget even more convenient to use.	13
I bought this to replace a replacement cover. The old replacement cover was old, ripped and still smelled like the strong vinyl scent. This one is very nice. It is nice and smooth and feels good in your hands. It takes some muscle to install but once it is one there it looks good. It could be a tad cheaper but it looks well made. The stitching is solid and doesn't seem like it will come apart. It doesn't move at all once you place it on your steering wheel so you don't have to worry about that.	2
I bought a 32oz peppermint one based on Backpacker Magazine's recommendation.  The 4oz bottle in REI sold for close to $5 therefore the 32oz here for $15 is a super bargain!.I chose peppermint so that I can use it as face/body/laundry/dish liquid and tooth brushing.  A tiny little bit is MORE THAN ENOUGH to wash the face and neck.  For you superlight backpackers, this is a must have for the functionality, weight to use ratio, and biodegradability.HIGHLY RECOMMEND!	20
This is without any doubt the best sci-fi RPG ever (and I mean ever) made. And it's so scary that the first many hours you play it, cold sweat will run down you neck. It's in 3D, and it's (in my oppinion) the only RPG that  gets away with that. And the sound is so great and sooooo scary that some  times you wish you never loaded the game. Even if the game costs $100, it  was still worth the money.	23
This isn't the biggest, heaviest or sturdiest guillotine cutter in the world, for sure.  It's fairly small, and plastic-y.  But, it actually does a pretty great job as long as you take your time.  It's very lightweight, which is great if you need to move it around, but it's easy to make it shift around accidentally when you're using it.  But as long as you line up what you're cutting well and cut smoothly, and don't try to cut more than a half-dozen or so pages at once, you'll get a perfect, clean cut.	17
I have a quite a few knives in my collection, ranging from spyderco's, benchmade, cold steel, ka bar to name a few, and this sharpener puts an extremely sharp and fine edge on all of them. It even makes cheap Chinese made knives hair shaving sharp. The DMT is by far the best and most simple to use sharpening stone I have ever come by, basically no skill is required to sharpen a knife with it. And hey it's made in the USA right in Massachusetts so u get good American quality. Don't think about it, just buy it!!	20
UI is very refined and easily usable.  There are so many channels that it's going to take a long time to listen to them all.  Plenty of choices for everyone.The audio queues for connection and disconnection are nice when you don't have the screen on and wonder why your music stopped playing.  Doesn't seem related to the application at all because some of the channels were flawless and others disconnected quite a bit.  (Mostly those from across the world like Ukraine).Good app, thanks for picking a good one this time Amazon.	1
I ordered this to try because most body washes irritate and dry  my super-sensitive skin.  This does the trick, it is very mild, and cleans without leaving your skin with that tight stripped feeling.  Nice, effective product at a good price. It is not heavily scented or as fancy as some other body washes, no bright colors or gritty beads, just a light natural scent (no added fragrance, which is  a big deal because fragrance is a major cause of allergic reactions) and an effective gentle body wash.  I highly recommend it, especially if you have sensitive skin.	4
"Item was packaged well, and seems to be of good quality, based on my limited knowledge of vanilla beans.  Though I love pure vanilla extract, I'm new to using the whole bean.  I withheld one star just because the flavor, when using the entire bean (skin included), had a subtle ""grassy"" taste.  This may be normal, or due to my inexperience and/or improper preparation of the bean, but I thought I correctly followed the directions I had read elsewhere.  Regardless, I'm happy with this product.  They certainly smell incredible, and will make your storage area smell delightful."	11
I've been taking this every day for a couple of months now. I'm not 100% sure it's doing anything, but I like the idea of taking an antioxidant every day. Others I've tried in the past gave me noticeable side effects. This is the only one that hasn't, so I'll keep taking it.Can't speak to the skin benefits because I don't have a lot of wrinkles in the first place. My skin does look better overall, but I'm doing some topical things to it as well.	12
very overlooked album!Hardcore fans may not like it...they lost one of their band members and it sounds somewhat commercial at times and different than their past stuff...but I love it!  It still has a DM feel to it.Barrel of a Gun is perhaps the most experimental....you'll think &quot;wait..is this DM I'm listening to?&quot; Home is simply beautiful and breath taking...Its No Good is great and catchy...and from there, every track is fantastic...be sure and check out Freestate...another beauty...this may not be a sure fire classic like Violator....but its a great disc if your very familiar with the band.	9
I love Woodstock.  I must have seen the movie as a midnight show several times in the 1970's.  I bought this edition because of the promised unreleased footage, including CCR.  It is NOWHERE to be found on the two disc edition I received.  Apparently, there is a third disc containing this in some special editions, but NOT the one I got.  I am still glad I bought it, but cannot recommend it to others for this reason unless you know what you are getting.	6
Best radio app! Was wonderful on my phone, works beautifully on my tablet as well.Very large selection of Christian stations, which is sooo hard to find on most apps (sadly). Feature PACKED! Has customizable sleep timer, alarms to wake to any station, favorites, backup, bluetooth, search...and on and on. Can't find any flaws, nothing missing here! Got as a FAOTD, but one of the select few really worth paying for. Nice UI as well. If  you're looking for an all-around radio app, this is it!	1
This is one of my favorite games of all time.  In this game, there are 30 different levels that are mostly composed of the same 3D Crash levels that we're used to. Some levels, however, you get to use a biplane, motorcycle, or Jet Ski. Like the previous versions of Crash, you have to collect crystals and gems.  Now, you can also collect a relic for having the best time.  The music is fun, the controls are easy and it's just an overall great game for any age.	23
Pros:Keeps litter better contained. It falls inside the tent or right in front of the entrance, instead of all over the room.Gives the cats privacy.Keeps the smell down a bit.Cons:It's difficult to get the zipper closed.The litterbox doesn't fit out the entrance easily (and unzipping it is out of the question).It's difficult to reach inside and scoop out clumps that the littermaid rake missed (and it misses lots of clumps, so I have to deal with this problem 3-4 times a day).	19
This was given to my son as a gift. He is 22 months old, and figured it out right away. It may have been a little too &#34;easy&#34; for his age, but he enjoys it nonetheless. He really likes to put the shapes in OTHER containers and pretend they are coffee or monocles or something. I'm glad to have this available for our next little one, who is on the way. It's a simple, solid toy (oh, don't step on this, the spokes really hurt!).	22
I got this disc because the Aerobie Pro is made for big open spaces and I only had limited space to throw. This disc was perfect for the smaller area I had to throw in and is just as fun if not more fun than the Aerobie Pro.The only problem I had was that this disc broke within the first day of throwing from normal recreational use. Maybe there was a defect already in the disc but I was very disappointed with its lifespan.It is still loads of fun and will give it another try eventually.	20
I can't say I have ever read a book that was even remotely similar in plot or storyline. Water for Elephants is one of the most original novels that has ever graced my eyes. I felt all the emotions Jacob did as I read, and the story seemed to transition seamlessly between the present, and his memories without being confusing as some other books can be when they try the memory flashback thing. It's one of the few books that I read that I simply could not put down, stopping only to eat and sleep.	5
I think Mario is a  great game. Fighting Bowser is the funnest part in this game. The best part is when you see Yoshi. Yoshi gives you 100 lives. It's fun looking for Mario's cap when Mario loses his cap. The game is one of the first 3D and is very good game for N64. Even thoughGameCube has the best graphics, the game is very graphical game.The game may have many challenges, even after you get 120 stars. This Mario game is very fun for N64 and I have to say this is one of the greatest hits I've ever had for N64.	23
All right, let's get right down to it! When it comes down to intimate apparel, there is nothing that captures a man's eyes and imagination as thigh-high stockings!These soft and sexy stockings wear well, and stay up. So, you don't need to use a garter, but I do recommend one. (I don't believe in understatement in the bedroom.)I highly recommend these stockings to you - or for you men, buy them as a gift!(Review of Leg Avenue Women's Stay Up 3-Inch Lace Top Thigh Highs #1022)	8
well i'm not impressed because all it is,is a mini food processor, nothing spectacular as they all work the same. I did like the fact that I could get it in a different color which was blue. I thought I would use it more but I have only used it a couple of times. I still like my bigger food processor and feel I may have wasted my money buying it. it probably would be great for an older person who doesn't need the big food processor and only needs to chop up small stuff.	13
Dickies needs to start making these shirts in an athletic or slimmer fit. The shirts are wonderful and comfortable for working in, but the tails are too short and the excess room in the stomach area makes it both come untucked and bunch up way too much. We're required to wear these where I work, and tucked in, so the strange (boxy almost) cut makes it keep coming untucked. The bunched up look around the waist line is also very sloppy.If they made these in a slimmer athletic fit, I would but a million!	8
A coworker turned me on to this product years ago.  It works well...takes away bloat and basically cleanses your system.  I drink it in the evening when I know I'm going to be home the next day.  For me it works like this...in the morning I feel the urge to go and you might think that's the tea working.  Nope its after that...you better not be far from the potty.  We call it the bomb tea because well...you drop the bomb.  ;)	11
My children enjoyed tracing the letters at 3-1/2 to 4 years of age.  At 4-1/2, they have moved on, so I got about 6-9 monhts of use out of these.  The cards are high-quality, made on card stock with sandpaper-like material where the letters are.  I would hold their fingers and trace along the letters the first few times, then they took over on their own after that.  Using the cards was a good foundation to help them learn to write their letters later.	22
Maybe it was my buffing tool but this paste struggled with cleaning up my mags neglected through a Michigan winter . I have allot left before I run out so I will update if anything changes . This is a fine polish not really for cleaning from my experience with use and since they mags didn't clean up I can't comment on fine finsish polishing . Need something a little grittier to buff before using this as a final polish . I have had very good luck with simichrome but it is allot more expensive by volume .	2
Although the design of these is to wind the cord shorter, when a window is open and blinds are drawn the cord does get longer. I left a room for 30 seconds and came back to see that my son had pulled the cord down and had it wrapped around his neck. Terrifying. Although these do pop open easily, they most definitely did not pop open from the pressure of a child's neck which I find to be a SERIOUS design flaw. From a company named Safety 1st - back to the drawing board on these!	3
This started out pretty good, but by the end, I felt some of the leaps in the story were simply weak. It was a good read, with good character development, but it lacked complexity. Many people may not care, as it's a novella, but I felt it could have offered more in the way of filling plot holes instead of glossing over them for a pat ending... to be fair, I believe this is a prequel, but it still didn't offer enough to satisfy my need to know.	14
As a keen enthusiast woodworker, this is a great bit of kit.  It makes very smooth cuts and is surprisingly quiet.I made up a new zero clearance insert for it (3 actually, as its a Dado!) and It has been absolutely wonderful for boxes.It has saved me heaps of time.  I use it with my Incra box maker and it makes a tedious job very fast.My curse?  Not speaking Imperial.  Shame there isn't a metric version, no doubt it would be very popular.	21
"I haven't been taking these very long to post a review on quality and whatnot. I will say that the pills are a bit much to swallow. They are big, however they don't go down too bad. I have a hard time taking pills and when I opened the bottle I was like ""holy s***"" thinking that I wouldn't be able to get em down. I managed, but it does take me a minute to work up to it. So if you have any issues with swallowing pills, these are rather big, but they are softgels so I'm sure that helps."	11
I bought this so I could make a few projects with my Kreg pocket jig.  I never did, I had so many other things to do with my Kreg I never got to this book. But that does not mean I cannot comment on its content.  I have been wanted to make the clock for a long time, there are projects in here that a young person can manage.  the instructions are straight forward and easy to follow, anything to do with the Kreg jig is easy.  I will be using this soon, hopefully.	21
My husband likes this product and has been using it for years. The reason I gave it four stars is because the online usage instructions refer to this product as foam, which my husband greatly prefers, but this came in liquid, non-foaming form, so he is disappointed. The liquid tends to run, while the foam stays put.  It would have been nice, if the instructions had not been misleading and I'm sure others would appreciate if the seller would correct this . Otherwise, it is a good product.	4
I ordered this charger as a travel companion, so I didn't always have to pack my original charger.  It's been wonderful having one I can just leave at home and one that travels with me.  I've had no problems with this charger at all.  Be aware that this is a MINI-USB connector, and while it will charge my newer smart phones, it requires a Mini to Micro -USB adapter... and is not as fast as the new chargers. But it does just fine for an over-night charging from less than 10% to fully-charged.	7
posibly the best game i ever played !this game is great, u may think u should just rent it, but dont.This game is so long it took me bout 2 months to pass it.there is a great storyline.i played all of HL games and this is the best one.for example in half life 1 u get to a radio, and a soldier says there to retreat. if u play opposing forse ull see this guy saying same thing to abort and same voice.great story line, great wepons, great multiplayer.trust me ull never get tired of this game.GET THE GAME!!!P.S.: you wont regret this.	23
"The 8 ply Flexogen (5/8"") is a staple for me, I have one on the backyard hose reel and it's lasted many years.  So I decided to get another for the front yard. Since I was ""cheap"" I opted for the 1/2"" size; it doesn't have the pressure behind it that the 5/8"" has, so next time, if I ever replace it, I'll get the larger size. The 1/2"" size is fine for washing the car, watering plants and hosing off the walks, etc., but that's about all, I don't think it would be the best for pressure washing."	18
This product isn't really one to review but it does what it advertises. I use this in conjugation with a one spot and a boss daisy chain coming from my TU-3 (great tuner by the way). Starting to build my pedal board so I figured better to start off with a 30 dollar power source than to go and spend like two hundred on a T-Rex fuel tank, which I'm planing on in the future. Great adapter for all of your pedals, decent quality, and only ten bucks. Can't beat it!	16
This is a really great preschool toy. I bought one for my two year old and he really loves it. He will spend a whole hour playing with it. The chunky pieces and pegs are great for little hands, and the bright primary colors  and variety of shapes are great for learning. The pieces also work well for making a color shape matrix to go along with my kindergartner's math. This toy was a wonderful homeschool investment. The one caveat is that I have to watch my two year old and make sure he doesn't bite the pieces.	22
Just to further comment on the music licensing issues surely holding back the release of this brilliant show on DVD..I can think of a show that had practically no audience when it aired, had wall-to-wall classic rock tunes, and had a great deal of success on the DVD market. I'm talking about FREAKS AND GEEKS.Another brilliant show whose DVD success MORE than made up for it's costs to license the incredible soundtrack.Knowing that WKRP was considerably more successful during it's original tenure on CBS should be proof positive that this would be well worth the investment in releasing it with all original music intact.	15
It's a good kit for beginners because it has everything you need to get started.  I used this on my six month old Honda.  Since it's still new, there wasn't oxidation or anything like that.  Just normal industrial fallout that left a non-smooth feel when stroking the surface with the back of your hand.  Well, after claying the surface it's like someone finally gave the surface a real bath - baby smooth now.  I also used this on the glass and same effect.	2
This one is also a very tasty dish from Progresso.  And the chicken is the traditional one.  Lots of it.  My taster thinks there is a little too much herb (can't tell which one) it is.  I'm not an herb specialist.  But that's not a deal breaker.  And, of course, big, fresh dumplings are to die for.  Little ones are what you find in a can.  And these is it.  Nice quick meal when the mood for soup is in your head.  I like it.	11
I've been a huge fan of dunlop picks for a long time. I started playing 15 years ago, and used the slim, floppy picks for a long time. As time went on and my guitar skills grew, I needed a pick that was sturdy, and wouldn't flex to play more intricate and detailed songs.The tortex purples are my favorite, and they're the thickest ones I can find. I like the soft sandy feel of these. They don't slip out of your hand easily, and because they're so thick, they take a long time to wear out.	16
As my office goes paperless, the famous Bankers Box is an imperative to rid me of outdated paper files. There are four (4) boxes in this selection; each white cardboard box is 10  by 12 by 24.5 inches with handhold slots and black grips at each end for carefree lifting. An inner flap flattens re-enforcing the sturdy bottom of the box and then two (2) long outer half flaps fold over to act as covers to the box which are secured by black ties which then wrap around black buttons on each end. Now for shipment &#8230;..	17
Come on, guys. This is just about as good as you're gonna get nowadays. Yes, the ol' girl is past her prime. Yes the tenor is squally. But when will you hear a better cast? Not in our lifetimes, I'll bet! (Though try the Opera D'Oro CD with Corelli and Sutherland.) The production values are pretty good. Orchestra is fine. Most of the cast hit most of the notes. Let's just admit that we don't have singers anymore who can perform &quot;The Night of the Seven Stars.&quot; If you want to see this opera, this is it. Okay?	6
Been having trouble with both my PC DVD drive and video recorder in getting a good clean start and/or play/record. Put this in today and followed instructions and after just 30-45 seconds, removed the cleaner disc and tried some prerecorded discs that have given me trouble in the past. No problems now!!! everything I tried out started up lickety split and played perfectly. Probably saved me from ordering a new DVD drive for the PC. Should have had one of these discs months or years ago. Highly recommended.	10
I had a couple of problems with having to reset my device so it could read the sd card before.  I like to save any applications I can to it to save room on my device.  Worked great for a couple of months after that.  Then since yesterday, it just stopped reading and started saying damaged card and try to format.  I formatted it, and it still wont read the sd card.  This was a horrible waste of my money.  I am very upset.	10
For anyone who likes board games, miniature games or Sci Fi in general or Star Wars in particular, this is a great, fun, simple game that can be a beer 'n' pretzels affair or deeply tactical if you want it to be.The presentation and build of the models and included card stock pieces is first rate. The packaging protective and re-usable and the delivery I received from Amazon was super speedy.The TIE Bomber adds some awesome capabilities and characters to the game. The ability to leave nasty little surprises for those pesky X-Wings on your tail is priceless!	22
I bought the S107G because I wanted the heli that everyone seemed to compare theirs to. I now see why it seems to be the favorite of so many fliers. I bought the red white and blue one because it is so attractive to a patriot like me. Also, Amazon carries all the repair parts for Syma helis, although I might not ever need them. I have crashed the S107G many times and you can't even tell it. What fun for an old man in his 70's who is going through his second childhood1.	22
I love this tea the taste is really good and it smells good as well my husband and I are year around tea drinkers and also we dont even have to add any sugar ( well I use honey on some teas) but this one you don't need anything extra and I will say it really does work drink plenty of water threw out the day .... And usually in the am you will be cleaning  it out lol ... I didn't have any stomach pains or anything but I eat well also!! I recommend this to any and everyone!!	11
This product definitely provides unsurpassed protection. I have two small complaints. First, the plastic inner cover does not have a hole for the camera. So the pictures look blurry through the plastic. But you don't really have to put the plastic on, like the manufacturer suggests. Second, it is a little too bulky. But I'm getting used to it. All and all, it is a good product. One last thing, if you are looking at this particular OtterBox, there is another one by a different seller for almost $20 cheaper. I wish I had seen the other one. Oh well.	7
This is a pretty nifty little peice of software, espcially since that the graphics are so good, for the price anyway. To me the driving realistic enough to make you think that it's real, but not so unrealistic that you think that your driving on air through a stack of concreate blocks and moving plastic ones with no windows or headlights. The only complaint I have is that it gets pretty old after a while. I've had it for about two or three years and I have gotten tired of it. It'll keep you entertained for about two years, though.	23
I sweat if it's hot or cold!!! This is the only thing that works for me!!!!! I HAVE TOLD ALL MY FRIENDS!!!! Buy this!!! Just DO NOT use after a shower when you have shaved your arm pits it will bun you. At first it does tingle with applications but after a while your skin gets use to it. I did have a rash/burn looking after first application. But using it when I did not just come out of the shower and/or shaving it works best!	12
I ordered the 3/4-inch hot brush for myself and after experimenting a few times, liked it so much I ordered the 1-1/4-inch as a gift for a friend and she is very happy with it.  It heats super fast, has many settings for heat needed depending upon hair type, and after a few minutes of experimenting I was glad I bought the hot brush style instead of a regular curling iron.  The delivery was fast, the items were packaged well, and the hot brush works according to description.	4
"But in reality, for the price ""I got mine for $89.99"" it's hard to beat.It'll make 12-14 cuts in a 4-6"" oak branch before the battery gets low. Good enough for what I want.I have the later make as mine does not have the auto chain/bar oiler. Fine by me as again it's just made to trim and do small jobs so oiling the chain every 10-15 cuts is no big deal.Mine did not come with the allen wrench needed for the guide bar plate but no biggie here as I have tools from many different saws etc."	18
"Bambi is one of the greatest Disney features of our time. Every scene in this movie just fits perfectly together, including everyone's favorite scenes: the ice skating, the ""bird"", and of course, the death of Bambi's mother. I don't usually cry when I see this scene, but it touches me having lost my father at a point in my life. Bambi is obviously a cute cartoon character, and probably the cutest of the early generation of Disney films, next to Thumper. The story is influential, and even controversial. It's all amazing!Rating: 5 stars/5 stars"	6
"This is a basic basal thermometer which I use for NFP. I found out about it from the book Taking Charge of Your Fertility - a system which I totally love and recommend for every girl/woman. This thermometer works well and quickly. I've been using it for a few months now with no issues whatsoever. It is a good quality thermometer - and it has even stood up to my toddler's ""attention"" - when she finds it and presses the buttons a million times before I can intervene :)Very good product that can serve many purposes and definitely serves mine!"	12
I read this book many years ago, when I was 13. At the time I was into much younger books for younger readers, but my college aged sister introduced me to this one - and I was totally hooked. A love of historical fiction and gothic romance followed, and I read all of Victoria Holt's novels. There was no end in sight after that, and today, 27 years later, I often wonder where I would be without Victoria Holt. I recommend this book to all young adults. It will introduce you to a whole new world, one of reading.	5
I've been looking for a reasonably-priced antioxidant serum, and this is the best drugstore version I've found. As someone with combination skin, I don't generally use a moisturizer, however this product provides all the moisture I need. It has an incredibly lightweight/silky feel on my skin, and dries to a matte finish. I use it on my entire face, specifically around the eye region.The combination of B vitamins and amino-peptides is great for my skin, and I wear it under my sunscreen daily. As a man, I like that the product is fragrance-free, and just makes my skin just look &#34;healthy.&#34;	4
This is by far my favorite book ever.  I am sure many other people will lay out the plot for you in their reviews, so I will tell you what I loved about it.  I love the bravery and leadership of the main character Robert  Jordan, I loved how Hemingway used people such as the strong willed Pilar  and other characters to only make it seem more realistic, and I mostly love  how Hemingway painted a picture with Robert Jordan that is the example for  all people who want to see what bravery is.  No author could top this book.	5
We have two dogs and have had this petsafe wireless containment system and these collars for over 7 years.  We are just now, replacing a broken collar.  The collar broke because it simply got worn  out.  The collars are worn all day, every single day and are only removed at night.  The dogs have never, ever, once left the yard to chase the many types of wildlife that are near our rural property.  It's an amazing and reliable fencing system and I have recomended it to many people.	19
This is the one.  This is the first all-in-one keyboard cleaning kit I have ever used that really delivers.  The instructions are clear and the tools are high quality.  After using the cleaner for the first time I was amazed that my keyboard (a Logitech ergonomic) looked and felt brand new after I had used dirty fingers to pound out thousands of pages on it.  Don't even bother with searching for another kit.  There is one thing though.  There should be about twice as much of the cleaning solution provided.	17
We've all had guitar cleaning cloths and most do a good job. When I see the word microfiber I always think of those cloths that stick to your fingers when you are using them uck.This cloth is different it does not have the same feel as most microfiber cloths and it wipes away finger prints and anything else on your guitar body like nothing I've tried before. With no cleaning solutions needed it magically shines the surface without scratching it.This would be great for Any instrument or anything else you want to polish without having to use solutions.Reasonably priced too.	16
"...but I just couldn't.  Honestly, it stressed me out.  I wasn't enchanted or transported, just full of anxiety at the turn of every page.  I read a lot of books, and I review very few, but this is a book I really wanted to love and had to force myself to finish.  I was hoping for something more along the lines of ""Carter Beats the Devil"", but instead I got ""The Devil tortures Carter and his girl and Carter ends up alone in a nursing home.""  I just couldn't get behind this story."	5
I had a Presto 6QT pressure cooker that was stolen by a Bimbo.  I got an 8QT foreign made pressure cooker but I liked the Presto, missed it and decided to get another one.  The old one was American made and the Stainless Steel at the top seemed to be a bit heavier.  This one  has a heavier bottom due to the sandwiched in clad aluminum.  The one Drawback is that it is Made in Communist China.  It seems to be pretty stout overall.  I can't detect any difference in the way that it cooks.	13
My son loves this toy. He can't figure out how to get jack back in the box to do it himself, but luckily his 3 yr old brother also likes the toy and helps him. If you're getting it for a young toddler, expect to have to do most of the work with putting jack back in the box, or have a sibling that can help. Too complicated for young ones. But I will say, my son absolutely LOVES watching jack pop up at him, so its worth it.	22
I give these pencils 4 stars  because I had better. I bought these for my 6 year old daughter for school. The pencil writes fine and the lead is nice and dark. The pencil don't sharpen as smooth  because the  wood is lacking in quailty , but it get's the job done. The eraser on the pencil is crap, it  serve the purpose because it don't erase well and break of easily. We need to make our pencils in the usa and not over seas.  So I would say buy the pencil because it gets the jobs done.	17
"Suave Daily Clarifying shampoo is great for removing build up.  I use it weekly because my dandruff shampoo builds up after a while; my friend uses it daily because the many styling products she uses leave her hair looking dull.The bottle says for ""normal to oily"" hair, but my hair is dry and I've never had an issue with it drying out my scalp.This has to be the best bargain shampoo in the world.  If I didn't suffer from dandruff I would use it only a daily basis."	4
I bought a couple of these in different grits. They are really handy for keeping a keen edge on a working blade. My family is in construction, and I'm the only one who seems interested in doing much if any knife maintenance. I got this for my brother though so I don't have to resharpen the knives he uses as often, and it let's him keep safe sharp knives instead of dangerous dull ones. I may have to get a few more for other family members and then I might only have to sharpen my own knives.	20
Romance, love, eccentricities, violence and humor are expertly woven into this novel.  I loved it and I was sorry to finish it.  It was one of those books which makes it difficult to begin another book.  I cared about the characters, and the events lingered after I completed it.  That is saying a lot about a book for me; I'm a voracious reader and I usually begin a new book as soon as I finish the last.  I think it is a book which would appeal to a wide range of readers'	5
I have found these folders incredibly useful -- I tend to have a lot of odd-sized scraps of paper to keep organized, and the fasteners are an enormous improvement in security over plain manila folders. I like the cheerful colors which encourage me to be more organized than I might otherwise be. The only drawback is that I would wish the folders were a little sturdier; as it is (and given the odd-sized scraps I'm storing) I don't feel I can put more than 10-15 sheets in each folder before they get warped by the bulk and weight.	17
I really love these ostrim sticks - they taste like pleasant beef jerky and are in handy stick packages, and have a nice spicy flavor with a bite to it. They are nice and lean, which i like over actual beef jerky.Word to the wise, however; do not open these before you plan to eat them (or eat only half and try to save the rest for later). I guess once they touch the air, they start to change taste and eventually will mold, which I found out the hard way.	11
I was a bit skeptical even though the reviews were great, but I can say without a doubt these are awesome!  I used them with 2x8 to make my work area taller and it worked fantastic!  My back thanks them.  I am now going to turn these in to a workbench using 8' 2x12, 3' 2x6, and 3/4&#34; 3x8 sheet of plywood.  I have no doubts that it will make a solid work bench that I can take a part easily and move when needed.	21
This battery is just great. I ordered one for my HP laptop's remote controller. I would rate this battery A+++++, would buy it again. Although it has not shipped yet, so I am not sure on the quality, I can guarantee this is the battery you need for your HP Pavilion entertainment PC dv6915nr with Altec Lansing speakers. I know , because I did the hard ground-level research, opening the controller, finding the battery, removing the battery, examining the battery, finding the name of the battery, replacing the battery, closing the battery containment area, and so on.	12
Resident Evil Code:Veronica was the best selling game on the Dreamcast.  Luckily for the PS2 owners Capcom has ported a version for their system.  But it all started on Sega's system.  C:V was the first game in the series to feature highly detailed polygon backgrounds, tapping into the power of the DC.  This coupled with some of the deepest most challenging, frightening gameplay in the entire series, and you have a game that is a must-have for both Dreamcast collectors or those who need absolutely every RE game ever made.	23
My 15 year-old 80# mixed-breed dog had slowed down noticeably. I followed the directions on the package but didn't see much difference after 2 weeks. At the end of the third week of feeding these treats once a day Herbie started running again. At the end of the month, he is romping and playing with my other dog like he is a puppy. I just watched him take the stairs 2 steps at a time. It seems like these treats took longer to work but once they kicked in my arthritic old dog now thinks he is a strapping young man.	19
I back quite a bit, and this knife has significantly reduced the time that it takes to frost a cake, it's that good.  Between this and my Wilton Trim-and-Turn Ultra cake turntable, I can get a cake frosted in minutes.  The weight is perfect, the width and length of the blade perfect, and I like the feel of the rubberized plastic of the handle much better than the wooden cake knife I had been using.  It has also survived multiple trips through the dish washer and still looks new.  Very pleased with this purchase.	13
The characters were fun and had their various flaws. I hate that this show was cancelled before the writers could explore the flaws. Although the show seemed written around Renner/Tamblyn as the primary cop-couple, each cop-couple seemed pretty interesting and there was a lot to explore in their various relationships.In the end, I think my favorite character was going to be the recurring character of Marvin. The two episodes that he was in were fun and he was great as a sympathetic criminal. Too bad this show didn't get a chance to develop. Dumb decision makers!	0
I have naturally light brown hair. Sun In is a great way for me to go blond that is very easy. Just spray it on, and head out into the California sun. I also feel Sun In gives my hair nice body and makes it fuller. People have commented on my hair, thinking I was a natural blond.I just wish they made a product to just do the roots of your hair. To spray from the bottle just the roots is alittle difficult.But overall, a very easy way to go blond with a natural look.	4
I got this game for my birthday about 3years ago.I finally beat the game today.I could have beaten it when I first got it but Ikept puting it off.I got to say I was very impressed with it,It is probably one of the only games to ever make me jump.The puzzles were fun and somewhat chalenging.I also like the differnt endings to it but i wont tell about it if you have not beaten it.Over all a very good game and pretty good graphics for a ps1,so if you like surrvival horrer check this one out.	23
I read both Ellery Queen and Alfred Hitchcock magazines, and I greatly prefer the former.  Consistently strong entries from Clark Howard, Doug Allyn, and other short story powerhouses really make this magazine a pleasure.  I travel for business, and short stories are a perfect entertainment - well-written enough to really hold my interest, but short enough to complete during the shorter periods of time I have available for reading.  And, I particularly love that this publication is now available for the Kindle.  Fantastic.	14
This version is soooooooooooo much better than the polanski one that one was boring this Tess has much better acting and is much more interesting. One day I was in the mood to watch this with my hubby at the starting of the film my sister& mother & niece came over they(all of them including hubby who has never seen it before ended up on really getting into it my mom was even talking about it the next day( if you knew my mother she is not that type of person) it is really  a good movie	15
Two quick negatives about this machine:1. Documentation is terrible. You'll be hard pressed to find even the most basic instructions in the manual.2. Software is buggy and will cause your system to lock up on  occasaion.The player itself is very good. I would also suggest looking  at the Rave MP2100 MP3 player before you make up your mind.Though this is a  neat little machine, I am not sure that the USB option works as fast as  it's touted in the promotional literature. Recommended with some  hesitation.	10
This is a tough unit, easy to set and locks tight.  The materials are robust.In a home studio there is never a lot of room and I didn't want a big boom hanging off the other side of my mic stand.  This fit the bill perfectly.  On the package there is an illustration of this being used at the end of a long boom to hang a mic in the perfect possition, and yeah, one could totally do that with this.This is a simple device and no corners were cut in its manufacture.	16
I chose tiis moisturizer because it did not have SPF in it and it was advertised as not to clog the pore on my face.  I seems a little more pricey than Oil of Olay.  I have always used a moisturizer after shaving, it does a far better job of soothing the skin thanalcohol based products P.S. after about 1/2 of the bottle the pump no longer will pump and you are left with 1/2 bottle that you have to beat out with your hand to get it.... I won't make this mistake again of ordering this... Shame of them...	4
"There's much i could say about this amazing unrivaled classic, however i'll keep it swift since it's infamous status as ""Best FF game Ever"" is world-known.This is proof of Square's original ""GOLD STANDARD"" days, before they became Square Enix.Needless to say, the Final Fantasy Name is tarnished by recent FF titles that don't even need to be mentioned in this classica review, all in all, there beth not' another grand final fantasy since 1997, A hui kaua Final Fantasy VII."	23
Great for beach or playing in the yard all day.  Nice coverage, pretty easy to get up, not really a &#34;pop-up&#34; though.  Will not keep all bugs out but will keep most of them away.  Great for if you are working outside in the yard and the infant is playing or the baby wants a nap.  Then they can get fresh air and you can get some work done.  Also good for beach, travels small, but there will be sand inside and again, not a &#34;pop-up&#34; so if you are on a beach in the sun, get ready to sweat.	22
Once I started reading this book, I couldn't put it down! Grabs you from the first page, and doesn't let go! A fast-moving read with lots of action, and no filler. It has love, romance, mystery, murder, animals and history. All while riding a circus train during the depression in 1931. Cutting deftly back and forth from the eyes of an elderly man residing in a nursing home, to the days he spent traveling with the train circuses in the 1930's, this story is gritty, realistic, fascinating and highly entertaining. You won't be disappointed.	5
These are available at my local big box store at about twice the price. I have doubled up on my 36 gallon with two power filters, so I use more. I only need to rinse them every week and change them every two months now, so it's nice to have a good supply. Before I found these at Amazon I was cutting the filter bags open and putting new charcoal in to extend the usable life of the C filters. Now I can dispose of them as they were intended to be.	19
I love mine so much it's scary.The graphics are absolutely beautifull.The sound is crisp and crystal clear.There is a huge library of games for this system, so no matter what gaming genre you are a fan of, there just has to be something you'll love.the load times are quick, and on some games there is none.As if this weren't enough you can go online for some multiplayer action.This is the best video game system i have ever play, period.Buy this and you will not regret it, trust me.	23
When I first got it, the wrench did work, however, it was never that easy to use due to needing to be flared out first to fit over the filter.  At some point, I lost the spring (not sure why it could even detatch) and then it was rendered completely useless.  Ended up buying a couple of the large socket looking ones that come in three sizes to fit common filters.  They're a bit cheaper, but I had to buy multiple so they end up costing more.  But, they also work, easily, every time.	2
Avery has some of the best products, and this is one.  These labels are so easy to set up for printing your own labels.  I remember the old days of having to order labels from some company.  Now, you can do all that stuff yourself right at home.  As I mentioned, this is simple for anyone to set up.  The instructions are very clear on how to do this.Not only are these great for making your own return labels.  They are also handy for many different applications such as file folder labels, labels for kitchen items, yard sale price stickers, etc....	17
Although the idea of these ice cube trays is great the actual use and operation of them is not.  They can be very difficult to open up after they have frozen your ice cubes. Needless to say that is frustrating and it ends up making a mess all over with pieces of chipped ice and so on.  The internal surface of the lid sticks to the ice cubes making opening up the tray very difficult if not impossible and leads to frustration and a mess in general.I would not recommend these to my friends or family.	13
Bought 2 of these thinking they'd be be similar to traditional head cleaning tapes that might play for 5 minutes before a rewind is required. These dogs run maybe 30 seconds giving a possible 2 supposed cleanings before rewind. The 'cleaning tape' doesn't appear any different than 'video tape' and any improvement in video playback was mostly imagined. Went back to using a 20 year old cleaning tape.This product is a DOG DOG DOG and stink you'll stir up after stepping in this turd hangs around for weeks.	10
In a nutshell, this is NOT an OEM charger.  Although it has the Samsung markings, it doesn't seat well with a Samsung phone.  This means that it's either meant for another market or it's counterfeit.  With that said, I wouldn't buy this again.~~~~~~~~~~August 17, 2013 - UpdateThe seller tried to make amends by sending me three replacement chargers.  After using this for a while, it is still garbage.  It does not charge my phone and in fact, it drains the phone.  This must be a counterfeit product.  It has Samsung markings but it does not charge the phone.  DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT!!!!	7
Wow, I'm going to have to change my mind about romantic comedies being predictable.  While this one does end in a predictable way, the story is anything but that.  I'm not one who cries at movies, but I actually teared up during the sappy moments!  All the actors are great in their respective roles, and the story is funny and moving at the same time.  I was going to avoid this movie because of the lame title, but I'm glad I didn't.  I haven't read the books, but I will now.  Very nicely done!!	0
My only complaint is that I should have ordered at least two.  My kids argue whose turn it is and/or become impatient waiting for their turn.  Since the turns can be long, the impatience is understandable.  My kids are 4, 7, 10, 12, 16, 18, and 21.  EVERYONE LOVES THIS GAME!!!  The 4 yr old loves to set up the cars.  It's great for her in developing matching and spatial relationships between objects.  Then she moves the cars anyway she wants to win.  I'm definitely ordering the railroad and safari rush hours for my family.  Great game!	22
The actual fluid may very well be working - it's hard to tell.  My problem is with the motorized sprayer - it's more trouble than it's worth.  The alkaline AA batteries that came with it weren't producing any spray, so I replaced 'em with rechargeables.  This produced a sputtering short-range squirting.I may try John Casey's fix but honestly, I'd prefer to just pour the contents into an old squeeze-sprayer and try it that way.As to the fluid's effectiveness - well, *I* can't smell anything, but the DOG can, so he has added his own ingredients to the mix.  We'll see how THAT works out!.	18
"We had been using more conventional mechanical traps, which would occasionally leave a half-crushed, yet still living, mouse waiting for me in the morning. I found this very inhumane and looked for a trap that would always instantly kill. This trap is it. It's humane, it is ""clean"" in that it doesn't leave parts of the mouse stuck to the trap. I would say this trap is very good for indoor use (garage, crawl space etc.) but not the final word for yard use. Perhaps with suitable covering? This trap works as advertised for us."	18
I couldnt find a peel off face mask in dept. stores unless it was just a one time application.  I looked everywhere. I finally found this on Amazon and it was reasonably priced so I tried it and I love it.  My face feels so soft when I pull the mask off and it will come off in one big piece if you want it to. They make my face feel so fresh.  I dont get this sensation with masks that you just wipe off with a washcloth. I will buy more of this.	4
I love the crisp, clean look of my organized binder.  I used the Avery template with success but had a bit of difficulty navigating it.  You will have an attractive, neat result with this product.  The colors may not be suitable for all applications but they work very well for me with the organization of my graduate studies as well as the organization of the resources in my classroom.  In both instances the vivid colors are beneficial. My only concern would be in making the site more user friendly.	17
My son is breastfed and sometimes takes a bottle of pumped milk when i am away...the variable flow nipples seem to flow the same no matter which side you hold it on (I,II or III).  I have used the other nipples (1, 2,3) and the flow seems to be slower than the variable.  Milk just goes everywhere ....i think i will hold off on using the variable flow nipples until he is a bit older....great concept, they just didn't work as great as i thought they would.	3
I guess the coverage is ok, but I don't like the texture.  It doesn't feel creamy and glide on like I want it to.  It has a dry feel to it during application, but your skin doesn't look dry after you apply it.  As I'm applying it, it dries up too quickly, and then I have to get more from the bottle.  A little does not go a long way and I have to really rub to get it on.  It also looks streaky after I'm done.  It's hard to explain, but I just don't like it.  I prefer cover girl.	4
The Cedar Cove Series is written so anyone any age can enjoy the story.  Since I live in the Pacific Northwest I could relate to many of the area references.  The story held my interest because there are so many stories going on at the same time.  Unfortunately the TV rendition changed a few of the events and personalities of the characters and that to me detracted from the book rendition.  I read all 6 books and enjoyed picking up the story each and every time I left off and resumed the books.  Good writing and story telling.	14
The first episode has a youthful Chris Lee for the villain, involving robots, 15 years before BLADE RUNNER.  The second episode has Diana Rigg the victim of a crazy movie director; sunset blvd with murders.  The third episode has canadian donald sutherland back when he was doing a lot of british stuff, and also has an almost unreconizable charlotte rampling as a cowgirl!  It involves being stuck on the usual mysterious island, with the usual rundown mansion.All in all, not bad; the usual wit and stylishness of the show.	15
When someone asks &quot;what is your favorite Disney movie&quot; I usually reply, &quot;Beauty and the Beast&quot; or &quot;The Lion King&quot;, as do most people. There is one Disney movie, which almost everyone loves, yet always seems to forget, &quot;Peter Pan&quot;. This is one of Disney's most wonderfully brilliant and magical movies ever. It combines the joy of childhood with the seriousness of growing up. I remember watching it so often that I wore out my video. Anyone of any age can enjoy this film...and will.	6
Just tried this product for the first time.  Since I find I'm so sensitive to sugar (almost any tiny amount sends me into cravings mode), I have been trying to find one that barely spikes your glycemic index and has no calories, etc.  True to reviews, it's not quite as sweet as regular sugar but as suggested, you can mix it with Stevia to get a good balance.  I have done that and pre-mixed it in an airtight container and I am very happy with the results for my baking needs.	11
"This is one of those rare cds where every song is good.  u don't have to skip past nuthin.  This is a classic r n b  album with alot of ballads.  The songs speak for themselves.  I like the remix for ""Wrap Your body Tight"" better than the album version and I don't think it's availabe on cd. What else can I say?  Johnny Gill has that good love vibe of the early ninties, check it out and hear for yourself."	9
The Good:  I buy these by the bushel and give them out like candy.  There is no way to say enough about these bore brushes.  I have been using them for over ten years, both in military and civilian capacities.  I recommend them 10/10 times.The Bad:  The only and very minor complaint is the wire brush part.  After prolonged usage, they can bend on you and become close to useless.  Unfortunately there is no real way to right them back up.  Regardless however, even with them slightly bent, the product works great.	20
I have no doubt that this oil is good oil. I do however doubt that the 50-70% price increase above other high quality synthetic oils, is not worth it. I can purchase castrol edge with titanium, mobil 1 EP or Pennzoil Ultra from my local walmart for $26.00/5 qt. The cheapest you can find 5 qts of 5w30 RP is around $43.00, 65% more expensive. This might be worth it for a track car, but no way is it worth it in 99% of consumer cars.	2
The vacuum is light weight, and picks up dirt and hair quite well.  It runs for a bout ten minutes on a fully charged battery.I am not too crazy about the charger annd charging base.  The charging base is made to be mounted on the wall with screws.  I'm not going to put holes in my walls for a vacuum cleaner that will last a couple of years.  The charging base could be used for counter top battery charging, but it's designed for wall hanging, and it slides on the counter, and the shape is not made for flat surfaces.	13
The tubs works great for my 6 month son, but I could not make it work when he was a newborn... He was just too small for the tub.And yes... its almost as big as a regular sized bath tub, but that's one of the things I like about it... more fun for my son.Taking off a star because of the plug... it doesn't stay open on its own... it keeps closing, which is annoying when you are trying to drain the water while your little one is in it.	3
Simple and does it's job. But for my use it extends a little too far out. It would be nice if the arm was about the length of the width of a typical lamp housing for those who need the lamp closer to an edge then the center of the terrarium.Simply made, but not really CHEAPLY made. But they could have put a little more into coating the product as mine has already began to chip from adjusting it's height. Would also be nice to have more user friendly and adjustable cable ties/anchors.	19
I've long been a fan of Alison Krauss and her band, Union Station.  Their brand of contemporary bluegrass is unique and captivating.  This album is their best work to date. Superb quality throughout, including the  instrumentals. The title track is irresistable, and &quot;There is a  Reason&quot; is rapturous. Impeccable musicianship and superb recording,  along with Krauss's unique vocal style and virtuoso fiddle playing combine  to make this CD a must-have for fans of bluegrass. In a word, masterful.	9
Quality sound, easy to find music can be sorted by artist, genre, or song title.  Each genre seems to have a good variety of stations to choose from.  It is also easy to switch from station!  It is easy to use and you can leave it turned on while you switch to reading a book or a magazine.  This offers every type of music from classical to country.  There is nothing about this app that I did not like.This is one of my favorite apps.	1
This cd rocks! But I knew this was going to happen.On a side note, be sure to watch the song inspiration on the web which explains their process behind every song. It really provides insight on the album. There isn't a bad song here. Something Gone Wrong is my favorite. It is an acoustic, 12 string piece, good lyrics, and a classic Joe guitar bridge. With overall tempo which I prefer. I do like the lyrical message on Three and Half Letters, (I Need a Job). I can't wait until Chickenfoot 2!  Or Chickenfoot 6!	6
"I picked this book up out of curiosity and was very impressed. A few of the stories in the horror section were a bit too graphic for my taste, but they were very clearly marked and all of the stories certainly left an impression.  The first section of the stories involved characters from Mr. Konrath's ""Jack Daniels"" crime series.  The stories could be followed without any knowledge of the series and they interested me enough that the first book of the series is on my Kindle waiting to be read. I'll definitely read more books by this author."	14
This pad is perfect for our playard. I put it under the sheet and I have no worries about trying to clean the matress board since the material cannot come off. It is very soft, provides an extra layer of padding since playards are so hard, and it can be washed and dried in the machines no problem. Even when we go on vacation we pack it up with the playard. Great investment for your babies saftey, babies confort, your sanity (when trying to wash the playard matress), and what makes this even better is the price!!!!	3
After recording several critically acclaimed albums for the GTO and Epic labels that did not exactly set the world on fire, Billy Ocean signed with Jive Records and hooked up with producer Keith Diamond who masterminded this classic 1984 release that made Billy Ocean a true superstar. The uptempo dance numbers &#34;Caribbean Queen (No More Love On The Run)&#34;, &#34;Lover Boy&#34; and &#34;Mystery Lady&#34; all became huge hits but the title track was and is one of the most gorgeous ballads of its time and one which you can still regularly hear on adult contemporary stations throughout the country.	9
I am a freelance camera operator and sometimes I end up having to edit projects.  Since I don't edit often I did not want to spend lots of money on studio headphones but at least wanted something that would cancel out the outside world when I edited and this does just that.  I was so impressed I took it out in the field with me on sets and it's great.  I can't hear anything unless someone talks into the microphone going to the camera which is great.  I love these headphones.	10
I've been using Neutrogena Fresh Foaming Cleanser and Peter Thomas Roth Anti-Aging Cleansing Gel with good success for the last year.  I decided to try Alpha Hydrox Foaming Face Wash based on good reviews (see beautypedia dot com) and a sale price.The first time I washed I used way too much and took awhile to wash it all off.  After that I switched to pea-sized squirts and it foams up and cleans great.  My skin is dry to normal and I haven't had any of the problems reported by the low reviews.I'll continue to alternate the three products.	4
Between November's shipment and December's, Amazon tripled the price of this item with no warning. I got a shipping notice for TWO orders when I only have a subscription for 1 a month. THEN THERE WAS THE PRICE! These pads went from around $17 to $45! Now I don't know about you, but I can't afford an unwarranted price increase like this.From now on, I'll be going to the drug store and paying the regular price even if I have to stop by three of them to find this size.	12
Superior product. Should never be more than $5, do not get overcharged! Thick and concentrated, but not greasy. I apply 2x a day to my thighs and stomach to help improve my skin's stretching power. Also, I layer this over the Massage Lotion for Stretch Marks, as suggested. Smells good and moisturizes all night until I shower next morning. Make sure to apply when your skin is already moist,  otherwise will have no effect. Have gone through 4 tubes so far in my pregnancy. Highly recommend.	4
i'm sure it's been said already many a time, but this is an amazing, underappreciated album...the tracks can stir up so many emotions at once, fear, saddness, hope, congering images both intensely beautiful and horrific...it's sad to see &quot;emo&quot; music today, so much of it was copped off the louisville bands and just diluted...but this is real, this is raw, this is true...finding this cd a few years ago almost single-handedly restored my faith in music again...	9
I've always admired the Porter Cable build and this is no exception.  It is a great saw, but definitely invest in better blades.  I couldn't give it five stars because changing the blade is somewhat of a hassle.  Installing the blade, no problem.  Try to take the blade out, problem!!Also, Porter Cable needs to offer a better warranty.  The fact that they only offer a 1 year warranty concerns me.  To me, it means that they are not confident in their product.  Milwaukee on the other hand, offers a LIFETIME warranty.	21
"One of my child hood favorite G-films released on a DVD of incredible quality. This DVD has even more special features than ""Mothra vs. Godzilla"", with an image gallery included. This time David Kalat was the `G-expert' selected for the commentary. I think he delivers an entertaining performance as he mainly focuses on the evolution of Godzilla from a serious villain to a campy and comical hero. He tells us his opinion on the matter and how it really affected the original series. The image gallery has some nice photos with captions and in the end another great classic media release."	15
Apron seems to be durable and is comfortable - I like the material.  I read a complaint from someone about sawdust in the pockets being annoying.  I ignored that as being &#34;picky.&#34;  Lable me &#34;picky.&#34;  I don't like it either.  I keep a remote control in one of the pockets to turn shop vac and dust collector on/off.  I don't like the accumulation of sawdust around that - nor in the pockets in general.  I'm looking for a similar one with a better design.	21
This tape is definitely useful in a lot of ways.  Picture hanging (if it isn't too heavy or fragile), securing items to shelves so they don't get broken, I also used some to keep a shoe holder on my closet shelf from sliding.  There are so many ways this can be used, the limit is your imagination.  Keep in mind, though, that this isn't like Command strips...you can (and probably will) lose some paint or do damage on finished surfaces when you go to remove it.  As long as you're not worried about it being permanent, I highly recommend it.	17
"Just a few anecdotes---in the 60s and in Germany, the only Coke product available was ""mit limonada"", lemon flavored Coke--I switched to the other cola for my Army tour and didn't die or lose my teeth.  Then as a college student in Iowa, Coke in cans was not sold there and one fellow student had his folks mail him two six packs every week,  he became a good friend to share pizza with.  I do miss the 12 and 16 ounce returnable bottles that are not generally available in the US except for the Mexican coke at a buck a bottle."	11
Quick and easy setup -- no installation required, even though it comes with screws. Mine fit perfectly on my linen closet door with no securing necessary. At long last, i finally have my multitude of brooms/mops/swiffers/dusters/dust pans OFF the floor and out of the way every time i open the closet door. A great investment for an organized utility closet! Shipment was fast and product seems of good quality, nice and sturdy. I like that it is white so blends in with my white door. Highly reccommend.	13
"Great in the sense of being very good, that is, but it also has a wide variety of items.  Sad (Penny Candy, Guess who I saw Today), funny (no synonym starting with s), satirical (Boston Beguine), sensuous (Eartha Kitt at the start of her career, with the memorable ""Monotonous"").  Foot-tapping melodies like ""Lizzie Borden"".  Enjoyable singing and dancing.  All set within a minor but very funny skit.  I repeat, great variety."	6
Robson Green and Michael Kitchen as two-thirds of a love triangle! I so enjoyed this production for so manyreasons. It's an intelligent and witty romantic comedy. Well written, well acted, well designed. I certainly enviedFrancesca Annis being fought over by two such extraordinarily appealing leading men. I bet if anyone asked her,she would remember this film series as being one of the highlights of her acting career. I only wish that bothRobson Green and Michael Kitchen had been given more opportunities to show this side of their talent.Great fun.	15
This overrated album doesn`t do much for me. I don`t really see what`s so special about it, and I believe it`s the band`s worse record. The title song is a good opener, and &quot;Karmakoma&quot; is a great moment as well, but after the third track, &quot;Three&quot;, it all goes downhill and turns into an average and bland trip-hop/ downtempo record. The last song, a cover of &quot;Light my fire&quot;, is particularly weak and just puts me away.A disappointig and souless album, &quot;Protection&quot; is alright as background music, but not much else.	9
This is very similar to what we called freezer tape growing up. It even has that same yellowish tint. So far it has come off the roll cleanly and we have not had any issues with splitting. My daughter has developed a habit of sticking toys (little plastic balls mostly) into spots where they don&#8217;t QUITE fit, and this tape has come in handy for helping to remove the toys. It isn&#8217;t quite as sticky as some types of tape, but so far it hasn&#8217;t left any type of residue on the toys.	17
"I ordered the 75-822 in May of 2006.  The receiver went ""deaf"" in August and I returned it to Midland for warranty repair.  They sent me a replacment in September, and by November the receiver had failed in the new one.  The radio will not pick up anything even with the squelch all the way down.  When the radio would receive signals, the audio was so distorted that you could not understand what was being said.  The transmitter in both units still worked.  Don't waste your money."	10
We are very satisfied with this product. It just has psyllium husks - no additives, no sugar, no sugar substitutes, like all store and drugstore brands. It works great, it cleanses your intestines, gives you more energy. I know it also controls cholesterol, treats constipation and diarrhea and can lower your weight. However, my reason for taking it while being on anti-candida diet together with Candida clear, garlic, pau d'arco tea and grapefruit seed extract.Thank you for making this product with no additives (can't take any added sugar)	11
The product is good quality and the idea pretty handy.  But adding labels individually to a tab is not really that stressful for me.I would like to see the dividers made out of thicker paper or a cardstock. I use these kinds of dividers at work and flipping through them on a daily basis wears them out very quickly.  The 3 ring binder with the labels is a nice addition and fairly stout and should last a while.If you like the idea of printing your labels out and applying them in a strip, this product will work.	17
I loved this book. It's about an lonely old man in a nursing home who's memories are sparked with the circus comes to town. He remembers back to his youth when he left veterinary school because of his parent's tragic deaths and joined the traveling circus. He details his unique experiences in the traveling show and of all the colorful people he became friends and enemies with. As mentioned in the title, there is an elephant, but the story is really about a young man's experiences as he struggles and learns his place in the hierarchy of circus and in life. Highly recommended!	5
This was a mildly interesting, slightly humorous, day-to-day chronicle of a very boring guy's life. I found the historical insights engaging, and some of the daily activities of people in those days interesting. I wish that there had been a little more about the wider events that were happening beyond just the writer's activities. But, then, that would not have been in concert with the title of the book. The author certainly believed in truth in advertising. The title of the book says it all. It's a quick read and never complex.	14
"My husband and I bought this changing table in the ""cherrywood"". It wasn't hard to put together--my husband put it together in a 1/2 hr or so.  It provides ample space for diapers, burp clothes, blankets, and other items you may need on it.  The table comes with a simple foam mattress, which is easily wiped off with a cloth.  We've been using it everyday for nearly 16 months, and still good as new.  No problems encountered at all."	3
gloves very comfortable and kept my hands warm for the most part.  The day I used them was the coldest day of the year and it was an early morning run and my fingers at the end were so cold my fingers felt like they could fall off.  I saw them in a running store and mentioned this, the guys in the shop said it must be because my hands didn't sweat.  Apparently they are really good gloves.  I will use them again but the next cold run will have another pair of warm gloves on top.	8
I'm not a huge electronica/dance/techno/what-have-you fan, but I do dabble.  If that's you, you might like this album.  The songs are reasonably catchy, and you may even find yourself humming them the next day  (I'm thinking &quot;Da Funk&quot;).  However, I found the album over-long  (I start losing interest around &quot;Oh Yeah&quot;) - fine for the  dancefloor, not so good for your living room.  Also, the  &quot;shout-out&quot; song, which is a quick (?) litany of people who are  &quot;in the house&quot;, is particularly annoying.  But for the most part,  it's quite listenable and fun.	9
I've tired imitation Merrell mocs in the past.  They fit just fine and lasted forever, but the comfort wasn't even close.While an imitation isn't uncomfortable it doesn't have the arch support or contoured sole that the Jungle Mocs have.I normally wear a D-E width shoe and these.  I did buy the D as I though the EE would be too wide.  The D does run narrow. If you are on the wider side I'd suggest going to the EE.  Other than the slightly narrow fit, great shoe.	8
Well, with a million reviews already, this makes it even easier for me. One of the original and best action/adventure games for the PS, you can't go wrong with Spyro (and the proceeding sequels). Owned the game a while back but my nephew somehow lost it. I completed it fully, an I'm about to play through it again, even though it's been like 8 years. Never got the sequels but I'm getting them from here now. Got 5 more PlayStation classics to go, including Spyro 2 and 3.	23
I can not say enough about the quality of Victorinox knifes.  Owned Spartan since November of 1978.They have never disappointed me except once when I drop my Explorer and the scale cracked.They would no longer send you a replacement scale you had to mail the knife in.I had a similar problem in 1988 and they just mailed me the scale and a new spring for my mini-scissors after we talked on the phone.If you need a tougher knife just get the Silver Alox type, limited styles no toothpick or tweezers but they are great.	20
My cat has gotten tape worm a few times now from being infested with fleas (when a cat gets a flea in its mouth that is infected with tapeworm they get it) and nothing worked! I tried a few different tablets and the only thing I found worked to get rid of them was taking my cat to the vet for a shot which was pricey. Just from taking 1.5 of these pills, my cat's worms were gone and for a fraction of the price of taking them to the vet! Would definitely buy these again if needed!	19
I bought these, but there not as strong as Binder Clips, that I bought at the stationary store, and the binder clips are alot Less money, and you get a box of them, not just 4...I don't keep a bunch of junk cliped on my refigerator, so I kept these OX0 clips in the drawer, they also take up more space then the Binder Clips do...I'm not impressed with these clips.But I gave them a 2 star for color!!! Big deal lol...	13
This one totally bites.  Unless you were born in the 40's this one is completely out of date.  No bite no bang and way too much buck.  The music is so annoying my girlfriend had to leave the room.  Hippy dippy elevator music with big bad bikers.  Everyone in this movie is an idiot and none of the chicks are hot.  If you are into biker flicks check out Hell Ride.  That's a biker flick.  This is yet another example of how phony the 60's were.  Save your money.  I wish I had.	15
I was not disappointed, sometimes sad, sometimes happy but always keeping you turning the pages, I most definitely would read more of this author.You need to realize that it is set in times past, but that only sets the stage for how grateful we should be to live in the here and now.wonderful tale. a keeper.The English OrphansI went to kindle store and downloaded several more of her books and can't wait to start on them. (I went for the freebies so don't know how the 3.00 plus books would be.) formating,english etc. may be better.	14
I have gum recession from using a regular toothbrush.  I was told by a hygenist to brush my gums, it would keep them healthy.  BAD idea.  It caused them to recede and I wish I had never listened to her.At any rate, using these heads has prevented that from happening anymore. They are soft and by using an electric toothbrush I can hold the brush head against the tooth itself, avoiding the gum line, let the vibrating bristles get my teeth sparkling clean and keep my gums healthy.Great find.	12
"Annie Lennix: On word---HOT! Her velvet voice sears in this DVD with The Eurythmics videos. Includes ""Sweet Dreams"", ""Who's That Girl?"", ""Love is a Stranger"", ""Here Comes the Rain Again"", ""Right By Your Side"", ""It's Alright, Baby's Coming Back"", ""Sexcrime 1984"", ""Missionary Man"", ""Would I Lie To You?"", ""There Must Be an Angel"" & many other great, great hits.VERY recommended!"	6
Of course, I am an old man, so this is how I am supposed to smell.  The crisp, clean burn of application is followed by a whiff of olfactory Heaven.  Think Barber Shops, where working men wait for a trim.Disclaimer:  If you have ever thought of yourself as a &#34;metro-sexual&#34; then this is not the aftershave for you.  If you are into Sky-diving, scuba, mountain climbing, hunting, fishing, rappelling, and sword fighting, then splash away!	12
My hair get's a REALLY ugly red in the summer when I'm in the Sun. I have to use an Ash Color This toned it down a lot. I had to do my end's for 10 minutes and then all over for another 15-20. My hair tend's to not dye evenly if I don't do it this way. Even when I pay A TON of Money at Salon's. I'm very happy with this color. I have been dying my hair for 30 year's and  have tried almost every color. I used to use Feria, but I'm sold on this now!!!	4
Fun app, I wish the vox mode would still be scanning while I look at the radar, so that I can compare the two to see what's the ghosts intentions are.  I started wearing clothes aroused the house because the ghosts were making me feel selfconcious.The first word that came out for me was not fart, but it was the second.  Some eerily accurate words.  It said the word power right before I unplugged it from the wall.Fun app, solid, entertaining, HTC EVOthe nudist	1
My Mom always told me horror stories about pressure cooker, but I really wanted one after listening to my friend's successful experience with it. I got this 4-quart one several weeks ago, and I am super happy with it!!  I have been pulling an entire beef top round and pork shoulder straight out of FREEZER to cook in pressure cooker, and I was able to serve dinner in an hour.  It's perfect for a poor planner like me.I did read the manual over and over to make sure it is safe, and yes, it is safe!	13
not so long ago there was an app called &#34;tune in&#34; radio. it was a simple app/ easy to use and do what it was supposed to do, play radio stations. i had it on all my devices and it worked well. then one day the app decided to upgrade itself. where once things were simple, now i wander through the app trying to find my favorites. i don't care about emailing everyone what I'm listening to. i don't care if the makes my coffee in the morning. sometimes less is more	1
I love, love, love Kiera and Gabriel's story! It had a lot of action, suspense, and wicked romance!! I am really getting into these characters and their lives and enjoy hearing their stories. If you like a little bit of it all, werewolves, vampires and fairies, this book has it all!. If you get a chance start reading this series, it is a little slow at first, but with each book the author makes them all come more alive. Looking forward to the stories of some of the new werewolves that have entered into this series. Great job!!	14
This is probably one of the most interesting tools I have ever bought.  I learn something new with it everyday.  Very easy to setup and use.  The only thing holding me back from a 5 star review is the design.  It pretty much requires exclusive use of both plugs (due to the shape) in a standard gang outlet box.  So I highly recommend getting a short jumper cable (they sell all kinds of them for plugging AC adapters ... aka wall warts ... into power strips) just get a high quality one that uses lower gauge wire and you shouldnt have any problems.	7
I purchased this for use on our play yard where our son slept when he first came home. When I received it the size was appropriate, and I was able to attach it to the side of our play yard. However, I was very disappointed in the quality. The plastic it was constructed of was thinner than I hoped and that made the unit somewhat flimsy in my opinion and certainly not as sturdy as I had hoped. When I filled it with supplies, it looked as if it might break. I ended up returning it.	3
"An incredible effort of the utmost grace.  Each piece is thoroughly thought out and the timing is simply impeccable.  The soprano's voice touches on the divine - it is not at all melodramatic but simple soaring gorgeousness.  My one mild complaint would be that I find the alto's voice much less beautiful - and her diction is heavy (e.g., ""get thee up to the high mountain"" becomes ""... mounthain"").  Aside from that, this is simply stunning.  The rendition of ""I Know That My Redeemer Liveth"" is absolutely shattering in its austere beauty. Wow!!!"	6
This plugs directly into the outlet, and the appliance plugs into the Kil-A-Watt, so unless your plug is really high, you're infor a bad time because the display turns off immediately when unplugged. The interface isn't what I'd call exceptionally intuitive. It does what it's supposed to, and gave me the confidence to tell the power company they lied on my bill. They actually estimated my electricity consumption instead of reading it like they said they did. My bill leveling was readjusted & I didn't pay the 3x price they tried making me pay. Three months later & still am right!	7
Don't get me wrong the H3 looks good and sleek but it gives too much feed back. What I mean by that is that when your on the phone, the other party hears an echo.  This happend on all the calls. The only thing that kept me from returning it was that I lost the receipt and i threw away the box!  I don't recomend wasting your money on this. One you may try that has worked for me is the H500.  Cheap looks ok and best of all, it works!!!!  Oh yeah my Razor had a hard time linking to the H3.	7
I agree with another reviewer that the included screws strip much too easy.  I purchased a set of these strap locks years ago, and I dont recall having this issue, so I'm thinking that Dunlop changed the screws at some point.  I was luckily able to get the screws in with some muscle, and the locks are secure.  However, due to this issue, I'm considering other alternatives for another guitar of mine that could use strap locks.  I hope Dunlop fixes this issue soon.	16
I have heard many times that this isn't good for your skin because of the tiny sharp pieces used to exfoliate.  However, I only use it about once every two weeks for a &#34;deep cleaning&#34; and am very gentle when using it.  It just seems to do a much better job with the deep, penetrating exfoliation than anything else on the market that I have tried.  Other brands have the round pieces which seem to just roll around on my skin instead of gripping or scraping off the dead skin.  My skin doesn't feel much different after using other brands.	12
This series was originally suggested by a friend.  I found myself hooked after the first episode.  It's a totally unique premise about aliens invading our society and the repercusions associated with both 'good' and 'bad' alien influence.  The action and all around 'feel' of this series is excellent.  I appreciated the character development and interactions of the people starring in this series. I also appreciated the minimal special abilities of the aliens.  I find it to be very believeable.  Highly recommended series.	0
"This is one of the best jam bands ever at their peak.  Sadly they broke up after the DVD was done and never played with the original lineup again-which is a pity.  Steve Winwood and Jim Capaldi made great music together-not that Capaldi has passed on, this DVD is an opportunity to see them perform.  The obly drawback to this DVD is that the cinematographer did a ""psychedlic"" shoot for part of the DVD, with swirls and other such remnants of the era. If you are willing to overlook this stupidity, then this DVD is worth it to you."	6
I have found this throne to be comfortable for studio use and it seems to be solid enough for everyday use.  It is sturdy and heavy enough for the average player and the price is definitely right.  The padding is just about right and feels good and comfortable for the session times for which I have used it.  I don't know how it would hold up for touring or constant use, but it is perfect for my needs, as I am a guitarist who plays drums for demos in the studio.	16
I acknowledge that this is a minority opinion - perhaps I just had bad luck with my unit and the attempts to repair it afterwards.  But while I loved the sound and functionality of this wah-wah pedal, it would literally last me a few months at a time before it became unusable.  I suspected that the potentiameter was shot, so I had that replaced, but the same problems reoccurred.  Like a horrible static noise as soon as started using it.Good product, but hopefully they make them more durable than the particular unit I had.	16
Bought this despite the poor reviews, figuring maybe since most of the reviews were older that they may have improved the towel since then.  Nope.  Quite possibly the worst towel I've ever used.  It basically just pushes the water around on my car and soaks up some of it, but doesn't really DRY the car.  It just smears it around until the water evaporates into the air.  My old beach towel worked 100x better.  And I thought Meguiar's was supposed to sell good quality products.  Live and learn, I guess.	2
The Diaper Champ has been wonderful in our home!! It locks away the smell so wonderfully that we purchased a second one for downstairs. I originally chose this one, because it doesn't use costly refills. The lid is quite heavy, so you do have to be careful of your fingers when changing the bags, but that's the only concern I've had with it. When you do open it to change the bags, you may want to do so outside. You'll quickly see just how well it locks the odors in.	3
I have suffered bad skin allergies and eczema for years.  I only use aveeno to soap my body with.  I don't think I am allergic to scented soap, but the benefit I know I get from Aveeno is that it keeps my skin moist (but not greasy), which is really important if you have eczema.  I also use Aveeno's eczema lotion to pair with this soap and together they keep my flare ups at bay.  I would give this a sixth star if possible because of the price here on Amazon.  It is nearly half the amount than the regular store!	4
When rooted, this is an amazing device, with a powerful CPU that can be over clocked past the normal over clock speed of 1300 Mhz and way past the typical 800 Mhz speed with only less of a battery life and no other ill effects. You will have to download the typical angry birds and fruit ninja games as apk files, but when you do, this device will shine. Other recommendations are tank hero, and Jet Car, and Jest Car Lite (the Lite version has levels that the full version does not even have!).	10
Members of our family enjoy Settlers of Cataan and other such games, but they do take a long time to play.  Citadels takes about an hour and isn't nearly as complicated.  I really like it.  Other members of my family are not as enthusiastic.  One thing I like about it is that it doesn't completely depend on luck (although that is a large part of it).  It might seem a bit complicated, but it isn't.  There are variations and it can be played by anywhere from 2-7 players.	22
I own a Compaq desktop, model 5686, &amp; a HP Pavillion laptop, model ze5170.  Both have Windows XP.  I tried installing the game from 3 different CD Rom drives, 1 of which was my CD burner and the other a DVD/CD drive.  None of them worked.  The disk kept getting stuck on the Maps/Mission_10.wot file.  I may have just gotten a dud, but I wouldn't try buying this game again unless I knew for sure that it worked on at least one computer that I own.	23
This works anywhere from AMAZING to pretty okay depending on the material. I was a little skeptical when buying this but now I'm glad i did. I recently bought a cat tree, my cats loves it and has already started shedding on it. This works great at taking all the hair out and handles all the corners.The hair lifter is slightly bigger than I expected and my hands are on the smaller side so I had trouble really grabbing it. I cut it in half and it works just as well.I've only just started using this so I will update*	19
"This is a classic little gizmo. We've used one since the late '90s and, even though the OFF button has long since worn through, it still works like a charm.I've purchased others as gifts for bewildered friends and once they've spent a little time with it they love it.Target and other stores have stopped selling them as off-the-shelf retail, but I hope SONY continues to make this little C-battery shower radio and doesn't screw it up with any ""improvements."""	10
For the price, it's a good product. The non-waterproof version smears like crazy on me, I can't even wear it, but this waterproof stuff held up even through major sweating, so I'll give credit where credit's due.  It doesn't thicken like crazy, it doesn't lengthen like crazy, but it just gives you a nice, solid lash line.  For a regular makeup-wearer, this is a nice casual, weekend, no-makeup look mascara.  For my day-to-day mascara, I prefer something with a little more oomph, but for casual weekend wear, and for the price, this is a good value.	4
The Soviet Union brought a holocaust upon its own people through the imposition of Communism, and caused untold harm to other neighboring countries as well.  Although Stalin tried to get in bed with Hitler, with whom he had much in common, Hitler had other ideas and only then did the Soviet Union become allied with Britain and America.  This alliance of conveniences has caused many in the West to forget that Soviet Communism was just as vicious as German Naziism.  This film tells the unvarnished truth about the old Soviet Union, an institution which Russia and the world are well rid of.  RJB.	15
I purchased this to try to remove the adhesive left over from the Lamin-x on my headlights.  Luckily i tried this on a corner of the headlight before i doused the entire thing.  Within a few seconds, it had turned the clear lens a cloudy white.  I ended up having to use a restoration kit and sanding away the white part.On the other hand, I used it to clean an area before I applied some double sided tape and it worked very well!  Just before you use it, test it on a small piece first.	2
This is a great girlie knife.  It has the same tools/functionality as the classic Swiss small army knife but looks much nicer.  It is clear medium pink translucent with opaque pastel pink and medium lavendar color camo spots.  I have not kept it in my pocket, so I can't comment on how the design holds up while rubbing against keys.  I keep it on my desk to open boxes or use the other tools when needed.  The knife is super sharp, at least when new.	20
I came into the book expecting it to be great, and I was surprised that it exceeded even my own inflated expectations. I've read many of Jules Verne's works, and I can sat that I was thoroughly amused the whole time I was reading this book. I've come to the realization that very few writers today even come close to the marvelous works that were wrought by hands such as Jules Verne. Would I recommend it? YES! If you enjoy a little bit of Sci-Fi, a lot of adventure, some laughs, and some good time well spent you'll love reading Jules Verne's &#34;The Mysterious Island&#34;.	14
My daughter is 19 months old and loves Sesame Street. But we were disappointed that she didn't like this DVD. She found the rabbit/bellhop character annoying and a little scary. He's kind of ugly and mean, and unfortunately he's the main character after Ernie. And her favorite character, Elmo, is only in one vignette. It was also too slow to hold her attention without more of her favorites like Elmo or Cookie Monster in it. She's learning to count just great without it anyway, so we'll probably just give it to someone else.	15
This masking tape is oversized and is 1.5 inches wide by 60 yards (2160 inches) long. It is a premium masking tape that works perfect for automotive work or even masking trim when painting your house. It stays where you put it and doesn&#8217;t try to peel off at all. When you are ready to remove it removes in one piece and usually doesn&#8217;t rip apart during the removal process. This is the tape that I will reach for when working on a project that requires masking. Especially for auto work because one tiny mistake can be a disaster.	17
My first Buddy Guy album.  I think it is pretty good.  I like the title track.  I find the blues classic &quot;5 long years&quot; interesting -- quite different from the BB King and Eric Clapton versions.  I usually don't like the Fender tone -- it is can be a little too thin or piercing for my tastes, but Buddy has a tone that is warm by Fender standards.  I read somewhere that he uses a Fender Stratocaster and Fender Bassman amplifier, perhaps he plays with his fingers rather than a pick - well, whatever it was sounds &quot;right&quot;.  Buddy is a blues icon.	9
Let me just say that i think mario 64 is a okay game as far as gameplay and graphics goes but, every level get's harder and harder it's so hard it would take you months to beat it and by the time you do you would be white as a sheet from staying inside all the time and 50% of your muscles would atrophy. also the ending really sucks it ends by princess toadstool saying let's make a cake for mario then it's over so don't waste your time with this game.	23
Unfortunately I am gluten intolerant and these have wheat flour.  I read reviews before I purchased them and someone listed the ingredients but they didn't mention the wheat flour.  These are VERY mild in flavor, not much zing to them at all.  Pleasant to eat and I would have enjoyed eating them but could not .  My husband will eat the whole bag I am sure!  As for me, I am on a continued hunt to find Wasabi Peas I like that have NO WHEAT in them!	11
For anyone who likes board games, miniature games or Sci Fi in general or Star Wars in particular, this is a great, fun, simple game that can be a beer 'n' pretzels affair or deeply  tactical if you want it to be.The presentation and build of the models and included card stock pieces is first rate. The packaging protective and re-usable and the delivery I received from Amazon was super speedy.The Shuttle is not speedy, but again adds some nice abilities and characters and the support role it can add to a fleet is quite a lot of fun	22
Zelda &quot;occarina of time&quot; is much like the rest of the Zelda series... it doesn't disappoint! With really cool items to collect and using your songs/spells to warp around, the entire game offers whole new dimensions.Things such as a horse you can call and run about the world, play carnival-like games to win power-ups, collect hard-to-find items such as the two-handed sword (which is better than the master sword, but you can't use a shield), magically powered arrows, and more!This game is fairly easy to beat, but finding everything will take you much longer!	23
I still prefer my Rio 500 and have yet to &quot;upgrade&quot; to any of the newer MP3 players.  It is light, smaller than a deck of cards and easy to use.  I used it primarily to listen to Audible (audio books) while commuting and it has been flawless [with the exception that one time it refused to boot up properly, with a checkerboard screen].  A quick search at Rio's website (rioworld.org) revealed a recovery utility, which I ran and recovered my Rio's firmware.  Whew!	10
Overall, it's a pretty good game. 1 star taken off because it does not feature the original soundtrack, and because of this many levels are silent or have different music. another star taken off because of load times, the graphics, lag (come on, no amount of enemies should make a game like this lag), and the censoring of some levels. Also, no 2-player Co-op, only online which is stupid. If you simply MUST have it on PSX then you'll enjoy it, if not then just buy the PC version.	23
Salad spinners have now been with us for 30 or more years, and if you're going to buy one, the Oxo, like almost all Oxo kitchen tools,  is among the best. But for the cost of an Oxo I can buy a crate of kitchen towels, and it doesn't take any more time to lay lettuce on a towel than it does to get out the spinner, rinse it, spin the lettuce, dry the spinner and put it away. Buy a dozen towels and just toss each one in the laundry after use.	13
I got this compact hair dryer to replace the same model, which I'd had for a decade or two but the cord started to wear. I found my old one to be very reliable and with a surprisingly strong air flow for the compact size of the dryer. I'd taken it on several dozen trips and used it at home often as well. This new one seems to be of equally good quality and has all the features I'd liked on my old one. I was so glad Conair still makes it!	4
Duracell Coppertop Duralock D batteries are premium quality batteries, as reflected in their price.  They seem to last longer than every other kind of battery I have purchased.  Although I haven't actually done any laboratory testing, they have been in a particular flashlight I have and have been in there working for about 10 years.  In a crisis or long duration power failure event, these are my first choice for survival.If you are looking for the best battery on the market, I think these are it.	12
I finished this book only because I felt like I had to. I suppose it was well researched and written because I felt the same way about reading it that I feel going to a county fair or local carnival: a little grimy, a little ashamed, a little grossed out. It's not a glamorous life and it wasn't a good time, economically speaking. The writer definitely gets that across. The content was just a little disturbing to me. But for those who like a dark and somewhat gritty story, this is probably really enjoyable. Just not for me.	5
I have had my Palm IIIx for almost 5 years now, and it is still working as well as the day I bought it!  I am more than satisfied with Palm products, and am currently looking into a Tungsten as an upgrade.  The Windows based palmtops are nice too, but they cannot beat the Palm's reliability and ease of use.  The software is also very stable and easy to use.  This is the only device of its kind I own that has never lost data or become corrupted.  Reliability goes a long way with me, so I give it 5 stars!	10
I started using this stevia about a year ago and was really impressed.  I just finished my last bottle from the old formula and started this new one I had just ordered - YUK.  It has an aftertaste like aspartame (and I should know, I've used artificial sweeteners for 40 years).  The only thing I would recommend about this product is for Nunaturals to change back to their old formula.  I'm already looking for a new brand to try and won't wait until I finish this one which was a waste of good money.	11
I bought this to go in my '05 Subaru Impreza OBS, since I needed a new one to replace one that I bought 10+ years ago. This one totally puts that bag to shame, as lame as that may sound. The elastic top keeps the trash in, and the rolled bottom makes releasing the trash very easy. I appreciate the way that it hangs as well, keeping its top frame from being too cumbersome and taking away any of my valuable space inside my compact car. Great purchase, and for a killer price.	10
I've owned this game for a couple years now and must say it is a great game with good strategy and re-playability.  The graphics and card quality as usual with Fantasy Flight Games is excellent.  The only drawback is that with the cards having a black boarder they are showing some wear and tear with color fading, but as i said I have owned it for a few years and has been in the rotation of the regular games we play that whole time. Overall definitely a card game I would recommend.	22
These are by far the BEST burp cloths around.  I got several different kinds at my baby shower.  I ordered these after reading the reviews because the ones I received at the shower were paper thin.  These are fabulous.  I buy them for every baby shower I go to now.  The middle panel is very thick and helps with a newborn that spits up a lot and those breastfeeding blunders that happen to a new mom.  I highly recommend them.  They are worth the money.	3
I love having a stripped down version of the game for the kids or new players that get intimidated with how crazy the original can get with new rules and Creepers.  My kids love it and they don't need to read the cards as much as the pictures are fairly self-explanatory.  This might also make a good large expansion to throw in your original Fluxx game, though it might make some of it too easy and some of the new rules don't won't make sense unless you are playing with your family.	22
Although I have had the opportunity to use other brands through the Vine program, I am still very pleased with the price and performance of the Avery brand of labels.  I have never had an issue with these labels smudging or jamming in my laser printer.  I use these not only for address labels, but also for frequently used notes on packages (e.g. Fragile) and to label file folder boxes as well.  The templates to use create the data for the labels are included with Microsoft Word and make easy work out of getting them printed properly.	17
This soap is AWESOME! I first found it at a discount store and the single bar lasted 8 months. I wash my face with it twice per day. Olive oil is the perfect for any skin type. Its nature's perfect moisturizer. The bar itself is extremely large so that it will not fit in a normal soap container. I was tempted to buy two just in case but its so large I will have it for awhile. Now that I think about it, I will buy more at the current price. You never know when it might go up in price.	4
The good news is that this is easy to spray on and wipe off. The spray handle gives a fine mist that covers a good area. The spray wipes off easily. The bad news is that the shine is not much better than if I had just washed it and left it. Maybe it will get better over time as the coating builds up. It also streaks a bit but this is minimized if you use a good microfiber cloth.  It's good stuff but doesn't give me the kind of shine I would get from a regular wax job.	2
"There's not much to say. This is double-sided mounting tape, and it holds tight. It's easy to apply, and works for most lightweight mounting jobs. It is labeled as ""permanent"", so I wouldn't recommend using this on anything you want to eventually remove it from. It's not coming off without some effort and residue left behind.My only complaint is that it's a small roll, but that's to be expected.There's really no competition. 3M basically invented this sort of thing."	17
Interestingly, these do not keep your hands warm...they just keep them from being cold.  When you are hiking, running or doing other things in the cold your hands tend to get cold and can really ruin an activity.  Gloves, however, can make  your hands overheat while doing physical activities.  These just keep your hands at a normal temperature so you do not even think about them.  They are knit and gripping is pretty much non existent.  But for running, walking, or hiking out in the cold, they are great.	8
I bought this for my 4-month old son. He is very fussy baby but when I played the music on this cube, he loved it. The best sounds he liked were the flute, piano and the Orchestra. The Best thing about this Music cube is that you can play one instrument at a time and then the final orchestra one to kind of show the music-mix.I believe it will help develop my baby's musical skills.Cons: The battery didn't last long. We used it for 30 days, for about 10 min each day and the battery died down!	3
Nick Drake's debut album Five Leaves Left is a hauntingly beautiful album.  Mr. Drake's folk music is backed by the baroque sounds of chamber music.  This provides a lilting background to his deep, introspective lyrics.  Mr. Drake had problems with depression and there is a sense of melancholy that permeates the album, but not near the degree of his later album Pink Moon. &quot;Fruit Tree&quot;, &quot;Day Is Done&quot;, &quot;The Thoughts Of Mary Jane&quot; and &quot;Way To Blue&quot; stand out amongst an album's worth of stellar music.	9
I bought this based on the reviews. Though it seems to condition the leather, it didn't really seem to buff up the finish and restore my leather to its' original, or near new condition. After cleaning all the floors in my home, and all of my car's leather interior, I followed the directions on the package for conditioning and protecting the leather seats in my car.  While it does make the leather more supple and soft, it doesn't buff up to a shine, or even satin finish, Instead, it seems to leave a dull, chalky finish.	2
I've used several different kinds of guitar cables, and I've finally settled on planet waves cables. From patch cables to guitar cables, I simply trust this company. In most cases the difference between guitar cables is the same difference between an iPhone and an Android, there really isn't one - it simply comes down to user prefrence. So in that regard, I prefer planet waves cables. I snagged this cable so I had the one right angle for my pedal board and the other end for my guitar. Highly recommended!	16
Okay, this is a perfect app for Halloween! My little nieces and nephew will get a kick out of it. Wanna know why? Because anyone thinking that a 99 cent app with actually detect real ghosts is insane. This is a funny little app that I rank right up there with the Magic 8 Ball. A cool bit of fun for the holiday.Those of you who are whining that it doesn't work for &quot;real ghosts&quot;? Stop it. Either call those ghost dudes on tv, or better yet use that money for therapy. You're welcome.	1
Only gave this four stars because it's only supporting a 32&#34; TV. I think I would be scared to mount a 55&#34; TV on it. If you sprang for a 50&#34; or bigger TV, spend a little more on a properly rated mount. As with any TV mount, make sure you're hitting wall studs with the main screws, don't just use anchors in drywall or you're asking for trouble. LOTS of hardware included in the kit, so mounting any style or brand of TV shouldn't be a problem.	10
Bought this stapler at a local office supply store and love it! This stapler is just perfect for a large or small office. And I have found that I use this as my dependable, everyday stapler. Most of the time, I just have to staple less than say six sheets of paper together, however, I recently tried this with a small manual that I printed that had 17 pages, it stapled it very well.And since this stapler does not jam, and it is of superb quality, this is the best stapler I have used ever!Highly recommend this to all!	17
"This book confused me from the beginning all the way to the end. It starts without any pre story. You dont know anything about any of the characters, all you get is this woman who is scared of men, these two ""hot"" guys that work with the girl a best friend who sets something!!! up, it doesnt really say until it gets hot and steamy. So its 0 to 10 in all of 3 seconds. This book lacked details that developed the characters and not knowing details made it seem very unbelivable."	14
Recently took advantage of a Porter Cable combo set--buy their biscuit joiner and get their 1 3/4 HP classic router free. Good buy. Had one of these routers years ago, gave it to my son and have missed it ever since. Problem is it came with a standard two-handled base. Outfitted the router with this D-handle-- which offers great control. Only problem is the router  has a long cord which has to be bundled up when using the D-handle to keep the cord out of the way. Pricey but worth it.	21
Bought these because the 2x2's I was using were old and splitting.  They work as anyone would expect a plastic pad to put on the ground to stabalize a trailer to do. They're not very tall...because they're flat...so depending on how high your trailer is after you level it with the Camco 44412 RV Wheel Chock you bought (because you need to be level before your stabilized) you may need to put a tree stump or something underneath of this, or buy more of these and stack them.  They seem to interlock rather well.	2
Sara Gruen's gorgeous new novel, 'Water For Elephants,' unfolds as a dual narrative, alternating between Jacob Jankowski's life as a nonagenarian, and his time spent working for a ragtag Depression-era circus as a young man. The plot is captivating (I missed two meals because I didn't want to put the book down) and Gruen's writing, as always, is transcendent. She deftly evokes a fascinating period in American history that deserves to be revisited, and her characters--human and animal alike--will stay with you long after you turn the last page.	5
I have been practicing with these bolts for several months now and have had only one lose its fletchings and that was because it went through a wood fence. None of the shafts have splintered or broken and all of the nocks are still good. Only one thing but its not a negative; the Amazon picture shows the bolts with green and black fletchings and all I have received had red and orange fletchings. I like the Red and orange better because they are easier to spot in tall grass. Excellent bolts. Don't pay more.	20
I've used many different types of hose nozzles.  Some seemed to start out ok, but failed after a short time.  This BonAire nozzle is very ruggedly constructed with a smooth adjustment mechanism.  The spray patterns are very even, though you won't get a really hard, narrow jet out of it.  What I like is that it will stay in the position I set it at and that it will shut off in either direction.  I expect to be using this nozzle for years to come.	18
There's a reason why these guys have been around for years.  Their quality and price have made them the best value there is for cotton swabs.  They do the job, however interesting that that may be, and come back for more.  They're indispensable if you have a baby or young children, but they grow with you into adulthood as well.  There's some things you shouldn't buy the generic and this is one of them.  They've been around for years and for good reason - they're great!	4
"Like his idols Marvin Gaye and Teddy Pendergrass, Johnny Gill proved equally adept at handling hard-hitting uptempo dance/club tracks and romantic slow-tempo ballads. The Hip-Hop flavored ""Rub You The Right Way"" was the big hit but the poignant ballads ""Giving My All To You"", ""Lady Dujour"", ""Just Another Lonely Night"" and the Quiet Storm classic ""My My My"" are this CD's real gems. Johnny Gill was simply one of THE best male R&B vocalists of the 1990s--as well as one (thankfully) NOT afraid to showcase his Gospel and classic R&B roots."	9
I've seen it, and I like it.  The tunes are great, and this sort of thing was what every kid who picked up a guitar in the 80s dreamed of (fame, money, girls...okay, mostly girls, and lots of them.)  My only real problem  stems from one thing:  Why weren't Eric and Bruce allowed to have a little  more camera time?  I think they were in the thing for a grand total of 3  minutes.  the other 80+ seemed to be devoted to Gene &amp; Paul being  silly.  Good shot, but not quite a bull's-eye.	6
These see mto be the best spark plugs for my Tiburon GTI love them. as soon as i installed them i noticed some throttle response improvement and it only increased as time went on cause of ECU adaptation. I also checked long term and short term fuel trims. prior to the spark plugs my LTFT varies from +8 to +12 which is not good at all. it's been a couple of months since i bought these plugs and i checked the LTFT yesterday. it was +2.2 to +3.4the car runs much better now. highly recommend these plugs!	2
The interactions between your character (you can chose between three types) and the enemies/allies is very funny and entertaining at times.  I got a bit bored with having to go back and forth between levels at times -- the goat guy and his special item isn't really worth going back for.  Clearly the ending of the game is set up for continuation of the basic world/plot.  I was anxiously awaiting the next edition after I won this game a few times.  With it had a balance of male to female characters though.	23
Anything I every purchase by revlon was cheap and works great as high pricey products. Packaging was great as if it was just light books were inside and delivery was perfect timing for me.  If you haven't tried anything by revlon then I really recommend all there products and purchasing them from this seller when needed to. It's really worth every cent you worked for and heats up in seconds when your on the go. I really have to complete the whole entire set by getting the other size barrels by revlon that works wonders on any type of hair.Thanks!	4
Unique product offering new kind of protection from fingerprints, dust, oxidation, squeaks, or &#34;gummy areas&#34;. 2 or 3 drops on a cotton ball and treat several guitars. This is a thin viscosity lube that shines your woodgrain better than new. I don't like greasy feeling products on my guitars so Dr. Duck 2080 Ax Wax is designed for my needs. I threw  out my Gibson spray. Too oily. Dr.Ducks Wax is worth the extra $3. This bottle will last a lifetime. You could use it on your Johnson if you wack off the finish.	16
There were some really hard words on the easy mode, so I can't imagine what words they have on the hard mode. I wish it could give you some clues, at least. It's annoying how in like six missed letters, you loose. One time I played alone and got 3-28. I was getting owned by my own Kindle Fire! This app is certainly not for kids because it's too hard. The time might come when you stop trying and you're just pressing random letters... Very annoying.	1
I drive a CLS 550 AMG Mercedes which is high maintenance.  Once a month I flush my tank out with this.  If I have any left over I put it in my brother's truck.  Both vehicles run like champs.  I notice a significant performance increase when the gas has the Techron in it.  Not just for high performance vehicles, but any vehicle can benefit from being cleaned and flushed with this product.  If you don't think so, buy a bottle and prove me wrong (unless your vehicle doesn't have an engine, then I'm wrong).  :)	2
The fit is good (feels good on my flat, hairless face) and it functions well.  The straps aren't the best and can slip a bit with use, but you can make your own or use a set you like from another/other mask.  In the deep south heat it can get pretty wet inside the mask, but it won't effect the mask to much (and it is the same for all masks).  Can't beat it for the price.  Cheaper than the big box AO paint masks, or 3M masks, but you can't find replacement filters as easily either.	20
They are soo freaking annoying!!  Why?! You spend all this time, da*n near breaking off your fingernail trying to separate these li'l buggers, and when you do finally get them apart, you accidentally hold your hand in a certain way or angle and they snap right back together again with reckless abandon!  So yes, annoying, but that's only because they are soo good at what they do.  You too will be happily annoyed with your purchase.  I'd stick my reputation on that statement... with these magnets!	21
An eReader without e-ink? Really?eReaders are devices dedicated to reading, and thus the main inconvenience they should avoid is eye-strain.By introducing a backlit eBook, B&N; removed the key point of eReaders.If you need a device that has a backlit screen (and can afford a $283 device), why wouldn't you pay the extra $200 to get an iPad, which does the job much more efficiently?Please, correct me if I'm wrong, because I really don't get the point of this device.Thanks.	10
I bought this to connect walkman type gadgets to my car stereo.  It worked well at first, but the wiring quickly started having problems.  The sound would cut out and I'd need to mess with the cable to find a position where the wires inside would be touching correctly again.  After 8 months, the wire is now completely detached from one of the plug ends.  Maybe the heat of my car played a role in the breakdown of the cable, but if that's how you're planning on use it, don't be surprised if it starts shorting out on you too.	7
I have owned this 510 for almost four years and have worn it nearly eight hours every day.  I have been very satisfied.  The cons for this ear piece are it does not block wind and background noise very well.  My ear buds are getting very loose after four years, so I am ordering another set of those.  I also ordered a new pro plus headset after watching the product demo in the wind tunnel.  Very convincing.  I will rate the new headset after I try it out.  At any rate, you can't go wrong with  the 510.	7
I've had a bottle of this in my garage for years, and it is great to put on threads to keep them from seizing.  I put it on basically every bolt that I might ever have to remove again.I only wish the package was better.  The brush is very messy.  I always end up using my finger, but a fine tipped squirt bottle would be perfect.Other than that, its a great product.  Also, unless you are a professional mechanic, 8 oz's will last a lifetime.	2
I liked this one. It wasn't all about the sexy times together. It was really more of a story, which I enjoyed.Christina doesn't trust men. Her father is an abusive alcoholic and her brother turned out exactly the same. So, she left but it's left her scarred. She wished more than anything her mother would leave, and can't understand why she doesn't. You sort of knew what was going to happen but it was a bit more surprising than that.I liked it. It was sexy, sweet, and enjoyable.	14
"Althought it started out slow, the story picked up enough to capture my attention and hold it through to the end.  I like how he was able to prove his story to at least one person important in his life to give him the chance for a ""home"" that doesn't turn out to be an insane asylum.  The character development was basic, but adequate enough to show hints of other, less obvious relationships that I'm sure will  be cleared up,inlater episodes.  Overall a very good possibility for my interests, so I'll be watching."	0
This is a really nice item and I got two of them.  Unfortunately one of them did not thread properly into the base and I had to force it which has created a little wobble.  That's the problem with mail order. Sometimes on a cheap item its not worth the time and expense to exchange it. Oh well so far its working OK with the my old classical (beater) guitar I have hanging on the faulty one.  The other unit seems to be rock solid. Oh and by the way these hooks are too skinny for a classical guitar.	16
We live on the beach in Italy for a good part of the summer each year, and the kids spend all day in the water.  I know for me, nothing can be more frustrating than leaky goggles, so I'm sure it's the same for the kids.  If you have never tried an Aqua Sphere product, adult or kids, you should.  I have never had a leak, never had fogging issues, and they are comfortable for extended wear.  I have had my set of tinted Aqua Sphere goggles for 3 years, and look forward to the same quality for the kids.	20
Wow! After watching all of MJ DVDs, I now know why Michael is the greatest entertainer who ever lived or will ever live. No one even comes close to his level of artistry. And each of these videos is a masterpeice. Childhood, Stranger in Moscow, Smooth Criminal and Earth Song are just astounding. You can watch them again and again and never get tired of them...they're candy for your eyes. You just don't see many vidoes on this caliber. And the MTV video music award performance is unparalleled. Would highly recommend this!	6
It will do a decent job or stuck surfaces.  The brushes used are reasonably aggressive.  It isn't a scouring pad but it takes care of normal pans with panache.It is FAR easier to keep hygienic.  I first got the plastic scouring pad version of this dispenser/tool.  That was a bear to keep clean.  It also won't wear nearly as well as this unit.  The pads are softer and wear and lack this ones aggression.I am very happy with this unit.  It is better working than the normal tools we use on pans or dried dinnerware.	13
This debate just goes on and on...i don't know which is better. I have RP running in my transfer case and Amsoil in my tranny. Can i tell a difference? NOPE! They both seem to have great specs on paper with Amsoil has a slight edge on the viscosity around 100C degree, other than that, they are pretty much the same. Both are synthetic.  The only difference is RP is actually purple in color and you can get it off of Amazon. Amsoil, you have to buy direct.	2
I tried the Sweet Leaf stevia a few years ago and found it had an aftertaste that turned me off to stevia as a regular sugar substitute in my diet.I am GLAD I paid attention to the other folks who bought this brand of Stevia!!  It's wonderful!  Has absolutely NO aftertaste even straight out of the packet on your finger!Now I will use stevia since I can handle a good tasting stevia any day!!  Highly recommend this product if you don't like an aftertaste in your stevia.	11
I have many copies of this movie. I pass it on a lot..I use it in teaching religion classes all the time..Jesus is not a solomman who walks around in majesty...He is a person who loves the people he heals,he laughs,he is charismatic,he cries...he isGod....He is the Jesus I always in visioned.....If you aren't afraid to take Jesus off his holier then thou shelf and placehim in the human world of laughter,love,and pain...and still be the Son of God, I suggest this movie.	15
By 1977 The Commodores became known for songs like&quot;Easy&quot; and &quot;Zoom&quot;,both mushy ballads to be found here.On theother end &quot;Squeeze Th Fruit&quot; and &quot;Funky Situation&quot; lean too farinto funk-by-numbers stylings and don't stand out as much morethen album filler.This is where The Commodores funk tunesbegan to become songless album tracks,bar the bands stunningtheme song &quot;Brick House&quot;,clearly the best thing on the record.So I baught this expecting a consistant album on a par with&quot;Brick House&quot; and ended up with an uneven collection,but that was a vinyl LP with a poster.So why would you want the CD?Because it's available I suppose.	9
i'm a professional dj, and i've been using my mdr.4700dj for almost ten years.  they're the best dj monitor headphones i've owned.  i know many new products (such as the popular pioneers) have come out since; and to be honest, i haven't tried many of them; but these sure beat all the cans i used in the past.  when you first get them, you might get confused about how to fold them back up. i think i was confused for a little, but maybe i'm just not that bright.  the sound is great, and the construction is definitely solid.	10
"As another reviewer mentioned, the iphone adapter becomes stressed and breaks over time. Mine lasted about 6 months, and I'm very gentle with my electronics. The plastic release tabs on the side both broke, and then the main clamshell came apart. I really like the CallPod because it allows charging of our Blackberry, cell phone, and iphone all at the same location with only one plug in the wall. But the quality of this adapter isn't that great.Written by Arthur Bradley, author of the ""Handbook to Practical Disaster Preparedness for the Family."""	7
installed on my kindle fire with no problems. very straight forward to operate. input your city and what you want and hit search. tried to find the number for our post office. gave mailing services in another city. tried usps still gave commercial mailing services in two other cities. our city has two post offices.  do not think  I will keep this due to it's unreliable information.Update. I just deleated this app and installed superpages which not only found my post office but also gave me a map to get there.	1
CA is under severe drought this year. Several neighborhood cities have enforced water usage restrictions already. I am cutting down the frequency of  watering to my lawn. And I am using this aerator to improves water usage efficiency for my lawn as it helps water to go deeper into the soil through the holes on the ground.Though this aerator is sturdy and it's easy to use, however, it's a manual process. So, I think this aerator is more for a small area. To cover a large area, I think power aerator is a better choice.	18
ONE STAR:The Maxell LR44 10-pack photo shows the new hologram packaging, but I received the old orange & black packaging.The batteries are stale. Lights powered by them are semi-bright, and only last a day or so.The orange & black pack rates 1-star.FIVE STARS:From the same supplier, MyBatterySupplier, I ordered the50-pack, which did come in the new hologram package, and the difference was dramatic.  Lights powered by the batteries were brilliant, and I expect them to last much longer.The new hologram pack rates 5-stars.	12
What can one  say about an expanding file? I think that the file itself is fairly heavy duty, I've had files with thinner outer walls, so I think that the quality is good, the walls on the inside of the file aren't heavy duty, but I suppose it's not needed there and the flap is not thick. But really, the file feels like it will last through any abuse I put it through for the next few years.I say that it's worth it and I'd recommend it.	17
"Brian Regan, IMO is extremely under-rated! It seems just about anyone I ask if they've ever heard of Brian Regan, their response is: ""who""??? well, I wish more people knew of him because he is just ""laugh-out-loud"" funny! Excellent CD, by the way... I saw him Live recently and he did a lot of jokes from this CD... buy it! it's hilarious! and one more addition, he's a ""clean"" comic, so your kids can listen to this CD too!"	6
All the other sauces were hot, but we wanted to try this one.  We used 9 drops in home made wing sauce (about a cup of wing sauce).  This is powerful, using as directed is a must.  We started with one drop and worked our way up to 9 drops in a cupfull of wing sauce.  9 drops are perfect for us.  This most definitely has a heat and kick of it's own kind.  If you like HOT and I mean standing on the sun hot, this is for you...but do use it as directed on the bottle and start small.	11
"""The Phantom Tollbooth"" is the magnum opus of all involved--that's saying a lot--considering it is co-directed by animator Chuck Jones and stars the very talented Butch Patrick (who was featured in ""Pressure Point"" and ""A Child is Waiting""; as well as a regular on ""The Munsters"").""Tollbooth"" is not only a film for the whole family, but is actually GOOD for the entire family.  Some features will teach children that academics are important, this piece of entertainment goes beyond that and teaches that being a human being is important.Despite what some critics have written--the songs are awesome and the storyline is very entertaining!"	6
We have really enjoyed having this since my son was born.  We do not use the heartbeat or music setting, but he seems to like the other two settings which are more 'nature oriented.'  I love the automatic shut-off and the voice-activated modes.We have gone through one set of batteries already, but it took seven weeks to do so.  (That includes a few nights/naps that I forgot to press the automatic shut-off)  Overall this is a great product and very useful.	3
I just received this for my birthday and I love it!  The color is great: very feminine but not 'fru-fru'.  It's so light-weight and comfortable.  I'm not too concerned about durability because I'm not hard on things.  But if it ever starts 'falling apart' I will be sure to update my review.  Two months later I still love this watch - light-weight and comfortable - wear it day and night but remove it to take a shower.  Overall a great value.	8
Got this bra in my regular size, (38DD) and I love it! I have VERY dense breast tissue and full breasts so I have a hard time finding sports bras that are supportive enough (I tried the donna karen full coverage underwire and the material was too thin to support my breasts) I love this bra, it comes up high, is super supportive and comfortable so when walking/running/exercises they dont giggle like usual! Next to try, the Wacoal Sport underwire bra, I hear that is fantastic as well!	8
Niacin is quite effective in reducing bad cholesterol in your blood, especially in my case. I am sensitive to most statin drugs prescribed by doctors.  The usual downside to it's regular use is flushing from dilating the blood vessels while it is being absorbed.  Slo Niacin has an enteric coating that slows the absorbtion, so that the &#34;flush&#34; is not a problem. It is important to watch the date on the product, as the enteric material loses some of it's effect with time. Slo Niacin is also much less costly than statin drugs.	12
I love the drop in system bc although you have to buy liners, it's easy, sanitary and really helps reduce air intake. My only issue is when I put the liner in and use the bottle to measure- it's slightly off so I have to pull the liner out and check the (example) 6oz mark and I am using the bottles that are made for expandable liners so something is off and I like to be as precise as possible... It's  not that big a deal but I wish the bottle lines and liner matched perfectly.	3
Yeah, I let my kid watch this show. And it's fine. It keeps him occupied for about twenty minutes, so I can try to relax. But if I am anywhere near the TV while it's playing, I pretty much want to kill myself. The songs, while occasionally creative, are brutal to listen to, at times. And once you've heard them, you will be singing them all day, whether you want to or not. So just be sure to press play and then clear the room.	0
To be honest, I wondered if this makeup was going to be good, because it was sold at a MUCH lower price than I paid in the store, but the ONLY difference was that it did not come in a box or package (except package it was shipped in, lol). The makeup itself is exactly the same. I like this L'Oreal product, it works very well for making my skin tone look even, and it lasts all day. I definitely recommend the seller, and will buy again myself.	4
We have a severe problem with deer at our house, which is in a heavily wooded area. Deer would come in and chew on many of the plants, even those that deer are not supposed to like.  We have tried many kinds of deer repellent, with poor results so far.  The Havahart Deer Off, applied to some plants that the deer seemed particularly attracted to, did reduce grazing.  I see that some people complain of the smell, but I didn't really notice anything.  The primary ingredient is eggs.The battery-powered sprayer worked well, though the assembly instructions were not as clear as I would have liked.	18
"Bypass are being used to cut anything "" green"" within it's cutting capability, and because when you squeeze and cut, the handle you pull up also rotates to reduce figer fatigue, you might lose grip when wearing gloves, so remember to use this line of pruner bare handed, cuts great under normal posture, also with palm down position, not so when palm facing up, so you switching hands to do the job, and that's when you will find out the power gear handle only rotates clockwise, and the design is not useful in your left hand, so left hand user beware."	18
Kindle can lose one's place in a book, making it necessary to page through perhaps many hundreds of pages to get back to that point. Perhaps this was an exceptional once only event.  Normally it will automatically go back to the point where one was last reading.  It is also not possible (or at best extremely difficult) to work from different points in a book in random order.  This book is one which is likely to require that facility.  This makes the Kindle unfit for certain purposes.	14
I really enjoy this device--being able to check email and blogs and send IMs while out and about is really nice. However, it's kinda huge compared to a regular cellphone, and I found that to be a bit of a drag. My service agreement seemed kind of pricey,  and the coverage was poor (I couldn't get a signal in my own kitchen, and I live in the middle of a big city, not out in the country) and in the end, I've shelved this phone for a smaller one with a cheaper monthly fee.	7
Don't laugh. My wife has been using this for years and I tried it on my face for my drying skin.  Later I used it on my hair as a conditioner at night and the hair is not dry after shampooing and drying the next morning. Amazing. At Amazon prices you can do this. If I were buying from retailers the cost would be a little too high to do this although I still might since it makes hair shinny and easy to control without being greasy.  I know I sound like a girl. So be it.	4
"I've recently been wanting to discover different types of music & artists from legendary female singers and Joni Mitchell was mentioned to me.  I must admit, I knew who she was but never had the pleasure to experience her music until I picked ""Night Ride Home"" as my first Joni Mitchell album.  Listening to this haunting album, I discovered her lyrics are extremely deep and complex, which is something a true artist/poet can only possess.  Overall this is true art from a true poet, absolutely wonderful!.  Up next for me ""Blue"" and ""Hejira."""	9
Flyleaf have a thunderous, powerful sound that suits the songs' passion and emotion. Heavy guitar-based rock juxtaposes with secret weapon Lacey Mosley's sweet vocals (and she can roar with the best of them as well!). Every song is fabulously catchy, not a weak one in the bunch. My favorite is the instant classic 'I'm So Sick'. The five acoustic versions of selected songs show how diverse the band is by not just rearranging them but re-imagining them. The dark, goth-y DVD included kicks! This is a band to look out for.	6
Wasn't sure how to rate the product since it seems well made.  My only problem is that I have never caught a mouse in it.  To be fair, the mice around here are sporadic so it's not like they're all around and this doesn't work.  I bought this product during a time I was finding a few in the garage and I decided to go all out on them.  I don't see why it wouldn't catch mice but for now, the regular wood ones serve my needs.	18
I put this on my Ruger Mark III Target and I am very happy. The multiple reticles would be more fun with larger targets, but at 50 yards, you only need the 3 MOA dot. Easy zeroing and not as heavy as expected, but then again, a Mark III Target is a beast of a .22 pistol. Don't buy the cheesy $20 red dot. Save your dough and buy this quality product. Aimpoints are GREAT, but over rated. If you don't mind the added weight, then this is a better buy.	20
Item is top-notch for those of us dinosaurs who still use VHS tapes (I have six working in the house (as well as many others in various states of [dis]repair), plus DVD recorders/players.However, I can't say much about the packaging from Amazon.  The enclosure was open (YES, OPEN!) at two ends and no paperwork was enclosed.  I'm hoping someone at Amazon reads this and corrects their quality Assurance procedures.Although the tapes are 5-star, I'm giving this order a 3-star rating because of the packaging.	10
This product weighs a ton, or at least way more than a document holder made for sheets of paper.  Also, unless your monitor is well above the desk, anything you put in this will block the screen, plus you need room front to back room between your keyboard and monitor.  Buy this only if you have the space and need the holder for heavy items.  For papers (e.g., contracts, homework) use a document holder that is longer top to bottom (or tape the pages one at a time to a top corner of your monitor).	17
This is an awesome app and by far the most User friendly of the calorie counter apps I've found for my kindle.  I'll be honest I have downloaded everyone offered and tried them all in a search for one that's both useful and easy and this one wins hands down.  It 's just so much easier than most of them out there and it has so many more capabilities than most of them.  It helps me stay on track for both eating and exercise.  I couldn't ask for more and I highly recommend it!	1
I bought this to transfer very old floppy files to a thumb drive. I plugged the USB drive into a Windows 7 64bit computer and it was immediately recognized.  This was a one-off transfer, it worked and I won't use it again. Dealing with a floppy made me appreciate modern data storage. God love anyone still using floppies...they have the patience of a saint. File transfers are slow because of the old technology, not the drive. The 4th star was for the easy plug and play, otherwise my rating is a neutral 3.	10
I've always loved carrying the Victorinox Spartan, and have done so since 1976.  It has the right mix of tools for almost any everyday need without being too fat or tool-rich to be unwieldy in the hand.  The bottle opener and corkscrew, as you might imagine, make it a hit at parties.What I love about this one is the hardwood handle, which remarkably improves ones grip.  It's become my everyday pocketknife (except at airports, of course), and I'm pleased to carry it.	20
I was super happy when I first received these headphones.  The quality of the construction is great!  For the price of the headphones, you are getting a steal!It comes with a 1/8&quot; to 1/4&quot; adapter, and all contacts are gold-plated.  The headphones can fold in for easier storage, and the cable is super long, just in case you use it to listen on a sofa(away from your stereo system).I am happy on making this purchase for this headphones, and I am very sure it will satisfy just about anyone in terms of sound quality.	10
I have this version and to tell you the truth have only watched once or twice since this version came out cause it is just way too violent even for a re-cut version. I understand it has to be realistic but Jesus whipping goes on what feels like for days. For a believer, it really does make you feel the extent of what Jesus went through in front of the Jews. If you don't mind the gore, then you will enjoy it. However, I kind of think I didn't need to purchase this movie a long time ago. Great to watch around Easter.	15
While the name suggests a simple application, the dev did (is doing?)  a good job. Very configurable, with different lines and coin requirements, and multiple near complete themes. I say near complete because there is only one set of sounds. The dev may be intending to add more as there is a custom theme option which allows you mix and match machines, symbols, and sounds.The graphics are done pretty old for the machine, symbols done much better. The game runs very stable and smoothly.	1
I have a Jet band saw and I too have been dreaming about owning a fence, but aftr reading the reviews her all 36 of them I would not ever consider purchasing this attachment, You would think jet customer service would anser these customer complaints. Evidently they could care  less about us customers,, so MR Jet customer surface person thatk theis and stick it where the sun don't shine.  Yes I was a John deere salesman , partsman, if I treated my customer this way we would have had to lock doors soon.	21
"This is a great product.  Takes many minutes off your gun cleaning tasks.  Also saves on supplies, such as patches, solvents, and other cleaners/lubricants.  For people who shoot different guns and calibers the Boresnake makes cleaning a cinch.  I use the Boresnake and the Boresnake Viper for different guns.  The Boresnake Viper does provide better cleaning one the first couple of runs, but both are more than adequate.  I'm not sure how these work with ""dirty ammo"", but with range reloads and factory ammo, it works great!"	20
I love the drop-ins system.  I used them for my first daughter when I went back to work and my family who watched her loved the convenience of them. I am using them again for my DCP for my second daughter. There is less washing needed during the day as the bottle doesn't get dirty.  I have never had an issue with these and was happy to find them on Amazon!P.S. There is also a system you can buy to pump directly into the bottles.  It was cheap and saves a step!	3
My oldest daughter received this when she was about 5.  That's a great age to get this.We love this game.  It's a fun game, even for the adults who have to play along.  We can play this for hours on end if the kids feel like it and not tear our hair out.Great game to help build a child's thinking skills.A wonderful gift for to have handy for ages 5-8, or so.  They'll play it for years.	22
The first one I got stopped working in about a month later, so Motorola replaced me with supposedly a newer one. New one continues to work but- person on the other side cannot hear correctly- lots of static like noises even when fully chargedFor the excellent customer service, I should give 5 stars to Motorola and 1 (or 0) star to this particular product.Update: After this, I tried Plantronics voyager 510 as a BT earpiece. This also had issues (while better than this Motorola T305), and so I gave up on bluetooth and went for wired in-ear Sennheiser headphones	7
I am in LOVE with these boots! They fit great and are oh-so comfortable. I bought these to wear because they are so versatile and go with absolutely everything. I have worn them with shorts, jeans and they look great with dresses! Now that I own a pair of Ariat boots, I am hooked!!! The only odd thing about the boots is the way they size them. I normally wear a 9.5, but I had to get these in a 9.5 wide because the fit is so narrow.	8
Others will tell you of the plot and so forth (should you really want to know before stepping into a good horror story) . There's lots of good acting here and GREAT sequences . I streamed a 91 minute version furnished by Amazon Prime . I don't know what i'm missing ? but i certainly get the gist . If you're a fan of Dario Argento and the cast , this one should appeal to you . It's an involving , amusing , red herring laden Euro chop fest with a doozy of a denouement . Have a look and listen .	15
These guys are still amazing! I honestly wasn't expecting a classic but boy I was wrong. This is easily one of their best albums and only gets better with each listen. Clockwork Angels is a concept album yet the songs can stand on their own. I love BU2B and The Garden the latter just might be their best album closer of all time. This album brings back that amazement I first felt with RUSH when I was 17 and bought Roll the Bones on tape. Geddy, Alex, and Neil should be very proud of themselves. I look forward to getting the book.	6
The infant side of this tub wasn't very comfortable for my newborn, she kept slipping and the middle portion that is supposed to keep the baby from slipping is a bit awkward with its triangular shape. It is also a HUGE tub. My mother didn't like it at all and she ended up getting us a very similar smaller version at walmart for 11 dollars, that was much more comfortable and actually fit in our sink. I'll give it another shot when my daughter is about 3 months old and will hopefully have grown into it.	3
It has a light, sweet, flowery taste and fragrance to match. The taste and scent is calming and relaxing.They come in aluminum sealed tea bags, which maintains freshness.I've never had Jasmine tea before until I ordered this off Amazon. I wasn't really sure what to expect from a flower flavored tea. But since it doesn't cost that much and I can add it on to any order of $25, I gave it a try. It's really good. I've become a fan of most Yamamotoyama teas.	11
I've tried both the Motorola HS810 and the Treo bluetooth headsets, and this by far is the best one. The problem with Motorola is that it doesn't synch with the Treo 650 100% of the time; while the Treo headset has very poor volume (I need to be in a quiet room to hear anything). The Cardo Scala 700 has great fit (it sits right over the ear canal), great volume (even when driving with windows down), and it synchs with the Treo 650 all the time. This is the headset I'd recommend for anyone with the Treo 650.	7
Simple and stark intimate concert movie showcases Robyn Hitchcock (the Soft Boys, ...and The Egyptians) playing mostly solo to a small audience in an abandoned Manhatten storefront against the backdrop of a large window looking out on a typical New York Street. The visual effect is sedative and seductive with the psychedelic pop storyteller singing the deep psyche of your average bi-polar joe, as he warms the audience with his mesmerizing pop numbers while intriguing New York passerbys with the theatrically mysterious storefront. And he's no slouch on guitar either.	6
Don't make things difficult for yourself -- Buying a Python will make cleaning/filling/draining your tank a pleasure. The connections are all solid with no annoying drips to deal with, and priming is a breeze with the faucet connection to your sink.You can even buy extensions to get the hose to wherever you need it.The Python is quality craft, and they also stand by their product 100%. They replaced a hose and connection for me a year ago on a Python that was 5 years old -- NO CHARGE/UPS DELIVERY.	19
WKRP in Cincinnati on home video? A great idea, as this was a consistently well-written show, and one of the more intelligent ones from its era, but New Video has done the show an injustice by:A. Releasing only eight episodesB. Using masters with the original rock music used during the network run replaced by stock musicC. At times, resorting to substandard and/or edited copies.Now that 20th Century Fox Home Video owns the rights to this and the rest of the MTM Productions library, it is time to beg them for a DVD release of all 90 episodes unedited and with the original music restored!	15
Almay make-up remover towelette like  wipes are much better than these Almay pads.  These pads irritated my eyes because they are scratchy and they have soooooo much oil on them.  One word: Horrible!  I have to use a paper towel to soak up the oil first before I put these on my eyes and it's still that bad.  I only got them because I love Almay make-up towellete like wipes.  Boy was that a big mistake.  Stay-away from these pads.	4
My last Dewalt scroll saw work light was everything I could ask for and had no problem ordering another one 3 years later.  This one looks exactly the same but the flexible neck does not want to stay in any position but straight for more than a few seconds.  Somehow they must have changed materials or specifications and got it way wrong.  I will have to make modifications to the saw to try and improve the function of the light.  Needless ot say I was disappointed based on the performance of the one from 3 years ago.	21
"I bought this to replace another pressure gauge from Accutire which became useless when the battery died (battery replacement resulted in a display of ""01.0""), I hope that this one will survive a battery replacement as there are instructions for doing so in the manual (well, instruction sheet).  The flashlight is bright enough to find the valve stem, but not much else.  It reads quite differently to a very old gauge I have, but I don't know which is correct (probably neither !)."	2
I got this to keep in my day pack while hunting, The size is perfect, it folds flat and takes no space but when it is open it is large enough to sharpen my any of my knives easily, My everyday clip knife gets abused, and I was able to quickly get it back to a sharp edge in short order with this. A lightweight American made product that sharpens knives well, it will be in my day pack all the time now. A must have for western elk hunters quartering up an elk.	20
Definitely not high-quality, but good enough for the average person. At such a low price I have an extra pair on hand in case my kids break one of theirs, so we have a total of 4 sets in the house. If you want audiophile quality, you'll need to pay a lot more, but at less than $20, these deliver decent sound and I don't get sick every time I step on one or break a wire. For sound I'd rate them 4 stars, for durability I'd give them 2 stars, and price is a 5.	10
The Coleman 4 D Battery Quick Pump takes 4 D-size batteries which will give you loads of time to blow up a mattress but the darn thing is loud and sounds like the bearings are bad.  Right out of the box this thing sounded like it was going to burn up or seize.  The volume of air expelled is fine for blowing up a bed but I would not recommend that it be used to blow up a raft.  The unit just doesn't have the pressure/power to even do a bicycle tire although it is not intended for that purpose.	20
I spent most of this book wondering why Gruen chose to intersperse her primary story of a young man who found himself thrust into the circus life in 1931 with the musings of that same man at the age of 93.  The story of how Jacob came to be in the circus and what happened to him there seemed like enough to me, and Jacob's aged voice seemed unnecessary.  At the end of the book, though, I realized why she gave us both perspectives, and could hardly argue with her narrative device, as the closure it provides works so well.	5
We all have fun with this - two adults, a second grader and a seventh grader. It is hard to see the sets! We end up screaming when we see one.We changed the rules a bit: instead of letting the person who finds a set rule the game and find as many as possible. We just keep it open - whoever finds one, gets it. Then the field is open again and whoever finds one gets it.It is a challenge to find the sets, so we like doing it that way, so everyone keeps having fun and doesn't have to wait.	22
Sure, this kinks a lot less easily than a rubber hose, but NEVER SAY NEVER!!!  It's a decent hose with nice HD brass ends, but it WILL kink.  Keep in mind if you're using a hose in colder weather, rubber is the only way to go.  These vinyl hoses STINK in the cold and have a memory of how they're stored.  They're awesome in warmer climates though!Overall we're happy with the hose, but believe it shouldn't claim that it'll &#34;Never Kink&#34;.	18
This was and still is an astounding confounding compounding  tribute to music!  If I have to break it down for you track by track or CD 1 and 2...then you've been asleep for the past 20+ years and really should run out and get this CD because you are wayyyyyyyyy behind!  Run, don't walk!AS...was and still is one of the baddest jams ever from any artist past, present and throw in the the future too!!  Listen to the words, not just the beat!	9
I have used Frontline Plus on all my dogs for years. It works great on my toy poodle and bichon; who are indoor 22/7.Now for my other dog a pitbull mix.. he gets ticks 3 weeks after I put in the application. I thought the ticks were suppose to die when they bit the dogs skin, but these ticks don't die! they feed on his blood :,( it gets bad. He stays outside 16 hours a day. I dont know why front line doesn't work with him. It works great with my other dogs.	19
"Absolutely one of the worst mysteries I've read - well, the mystery was not all that bad, but the writing was very vanilla.  By that I mean: fairly simple sentences and almost no interesting, imaginative adjectives.  About half way through, I was bored, and I ""paged forward"" to the end just to see who the murderer was.  A surprise - which is the only reason I gave it two stars.  Further, I could not figure out how the perp knew where the to-be victims were and how to get at them.  Maybe that was in the part I skipped."	14
Bought 3 packs, prepared to live with a high percentage of bad ones considering that locally the same batteries are $3 each, but they are easy to check in the card and all were good.  Bought these in 2011 just used the last ones and came back to order more when I realized I hadn't reviewed them.  Very pleased.BTW, it is true that the description is misleading, the batteries I received are alkaline, not silver-oxide.  I will use only silver oxide in timekeeping devices, but for toys and flashlights, alkaline is a better value.	12
Stumbling onto this series was serendipitous, especially after seeing the price!  I've often wondered  if the price reflects the content quality, and after reading this book, I am happy to say I am wrong!  I enjoyed this interesting and fast read immensely!It begins with our heroine, who happens to be deaf, going to the wilds of Alaska for a little cross country skiing.  Upon her arrival to her destination, she encounters some interesting (and handsome) gentlemen who immediately sense something about her.  Unfortunately, it's something of which she is completely unaware.  Enjoy!	14
The book was quick reading, but I wasn't impressed at all.The story line just seemed to be a rip off of the hulk story with some twists to it.  Evil hulk(Trent) with a religious cousin(Jonathan) who has the same power.  All created by a mad scientist(Trent) who was infected(along with Jonathan) in a accident with the formula.There you go, that's the story. That's it.The good, the book was cheap.The bad, the story equaled the price of the book.	14
"I bought both the black and the brown Woven Chenille Small Cross Body Bags for when I don't need to carry much more than keys, some ID, some money and a few tissues.  I love cross-body bags because I now use a cane and sometimes have my little dog on a leash and need at least one hand free.  The size accommodates the above items.  The woven ""strap"" is adequate, and seems securely attached.  They suit me just fine, and I am very happy with them."	13
My wife was having soreness in her wrists that may have signaled the onset of carpal tunnel syndrome. I ordered the Belkin Wave Rest wrist pad, and since she started using it, the soreness has subsided. She loves the pad. It's about an inch wider than the keyboard she's using, so she doesn't have to move her hands off the pad. I've used it a few times, and I liked it enough that I may get one for myself.I think the wrist pad is worth trying for anyone who may be developing carpal tunnel syndrome or any related problem.	17
Got this to replace a frayed OEM cord. The cord itself is ok ;however, the plug that looks like OEM and is stamped as such, is crap! Took 8 times longer to charge with this unit! When the cord was paired with the actual OEM plug in, it worked fine. So if you need a cord its ok; however, it is definitely not OEM and the plug is worthless. For the price and really just needing a cord it is a good value but I am very disappointed with the false markings as OEM when it is certainly not.	7
This special tape is perfect for holiday wrapping chores. It adheres well, is less likely than many to tangle, and has a nice finish that disappears on the paper once it's been applied. I've too often bought bargain-brand tape for the holidays, and it is just not worth it. The difficulties using those flimsy tape dispensers and lousy cutters, not to mention the tendency to curl up and tangle, make wrapping a chore. Well, this tape doesn't make wrapping a pleasure, but it does make it easy and quick, with a lovely professional appearance.	17
"No, I won't forget WATER FOR ELEPHANTS any time soon. The prologue is one of the best I've read in a long time. I actually called a friend and ready it to her out loud. The characters, in particular, Rosie the elephant and Jacob are accurate and tender, each in their own sometimes sad and poignant way. This book is a summer hit for a reason--it's an enjoyable read filled with the peculiarities of circus life that intrigue and woo all who are drawn to such a menagerie known as the ""Greatest Show on Earth."" ~Carol D. O'Dell"	5
I initially hesitated to buy any ready-to-eat product fearing that they might taste bad or how they could be preserved without preservatives.  But when shopping last week, I found it in the Indian cuisine aisle and decided to give it a try.  I just heated it and found it to be better tasting.  But you add lemon juice (enough to give it the sour tangy taste) and chopped cilantro.  I also added quarter teaspoon of chilli powder, rasam powder and salt accordingly to give it a fresh taste.  Try the above directions for a real good taste.	11
App and reviews sounded great, esp. for free, but it never worked for me.  I downloaded it twice, uninstalling in between and rebooting phone, and still kept getting the weird 'ball bouncing on hard floor' sound and 'Android Media console died' message no matter what radio station I tried.  I got one to stream for a few seconds but it kept losing the connection and going on and off.  I'm on Verizon 4G with a very strong signal. so it's just an app that won't work for me.	1
My grandson was mesmerized by the accordion he heard a musician play while he was on holiday in Mexico,so I bought this as part of his gift for his 4th birthday but he is probably a little on the young side for this instrument.The instrument is well made and just the right size for a young budding musician. Our 6 year old grandson  was able to open and squeeze the music box but I cannot attest to music quality the instrument produced...we just lacked the music skills. Hopefully given time and practice our grandchildren will acquire these skills.	22
Bought this for my 2 yr old daughter. She loves brushing her teeth at the same time i do mine. She was not too sure about the taste of this toothpaste. The previous gel we used was kind of sweet, she got used to it. She thought this was different and was cautious for the first few times. The gel is minty to taste and leave nice minty breath. It is child safe as it doesn't have harmful stuff like fluoride. Surely worth a try if you're looking for a new tooth gel for your little ones.	4
"Tarragon has a cool aromatic scent when one opens the bottle. From the McCormick web site, I learned that tarragon means ""little dragon.""The McCormick web site (mccormick.com) gives a sense of what type of recipe tarragon might work in. Beyond that, it is a versatile herb, going with quite a few dishes. Among these: asparagus, broccoli, carrots, cauliflower, mushrooms, potatoes, tomatoes, chicken dishes, pork dishes, and seafood dishes. It also works well with egg dishes and in sauces. Again, versatile.So, this is a useful component of anyone's pantry. . . ."	11
First off, most audio racks have that annoying &#34;slide these little metal pieces over the rails and put your screws into them&#34; instead of properly sized holes. Not this one. Not only do the holes get made proper size with threads in them, but it even includes 48 screws so you don't have to try to figure out which of the 3 sizes you've collected over the years is going to fit.I loaded it up with equipment and haven't had a worry about it since. Solid construction and the mounting just works. This one is done right.	16
I really liked the Medela products at first, but I never really liked these bags, mainly because you have to tie them with a folded over twist tie to close them.  If you get too much milk in the bag, it will leak when you close it up.  Then one of my bags tipped over in the freezer and it leaked, causing a frozen puddle of breast milk in my brand new freezer to clean.  Plus, the bag got stuck in the puddle.I have also used the Gerber bags, and I liked those much better.	3
I have been seeing an eye Dr and she wanted me on an eye formula vitamin.  I don't know if it's making a difference.  I have been on it 3 months.  I had an eye visit last week and my eyes have improved!  Good news.  I would like to say it was because of this formula but I don't really know.  I have nothing bad to say about this one.  I take it 2 times a day.  It doesn't upset my stomach.	12
"I LOVE this movie So much!  I don't care what kind of trouble Mel Gibson is going thru in his personal life, this movie is really a masterpiece!  It really gets across how much our precious Lord really did suffer for us!  This film makes me want to cry, scream, but mostly it makes me want to CHEER!  And I did!  When I saw it in the theater, and it went off, I yelled ""NO!!! DON'T GO OFF NOW!!!"", but it did.  At least we Christians know the rest of the story-WE WIN! PRAISE OUR LORD JESUS!"	15
Very clever design work here.  The box almost folds itself into place.  When I say it took 30 seconds from flat box to assembled, loaded and tied shut... that was my WORST time.Of course, you may not be assembling and filling 100 boxes a session.  But even if you only use one at a time you get a very nice box.  It has hand-sized holes for easy lifting OR you can use the plastic handle to drag the really ones.Standard file fits neatly inside.	17
This captures Mary Chapin Carpenter at her best. In beautiful surroundings, MCC is relaxed and loose, laughing and telling stories and interacting with the audience. Watching her perform adds another layer of integrity to her music. There is a good selection of her music and the performance itself is a delight. Interspersed with the music are clips of behind the scenes preparation and interviews with other singers. I think MCC's greatest gift is her ability to connect with those who listen to her; this video makes it all the more evident.	6
We've had an Aerogarden for two years now and love it.  This is the first time we have gotten the Japanese Herb Kit and it has some problems:  the Red Shiso, Green Shiso and Nira Chives did not germinate at all.  We e-mailed Aerogrow customer service department and they are sending us a new Japanese Herb Kit free of charge.  We've used the herbs that did germinate:  Chrysanthemum, Mitsuba and Cress in salads and on sandwiches.  The flavors of these herbs is interesting, but we are really looking forward to using the Red and Green Shiso, which are more widely used in Japanese food.	18
This video is so much fun to do! This is a video I can do without taking any water breaks 'cause it's just so much fun to do! The dances are easy to pick up, plus they're good to learn to do at any parties. Kathy gives good instruction, so it's very easy to keep up. Although I mention the word &quot;easy&quot; a couple of times, this workout is still very challenging. It gets your heart rate up, and you'll definitely break a sweat. But you'll be having so much fun, you won't even notice!	15
This product keeps my skin feeling refreshed and keeps my complexion fairly clean. It is light enough to use everyday!I had light acne and did not want to use harsh acne medication and products so I had to look for an alternative.I was a little skeptical at first since this product didn't offer much in the first couple of uses but it seemed to keep my skin beautiful and clear!I highly recommend this product because of it's price-value and quality.Price: 5/5Everyday use: 5/5Quality: 5/5Keeping you beautiful: 100/5	4
I'VE BEEN WEARING THESE PANTS FOR 30 YEARS.  YEARS AGO WHEN THEY WERE AMERICAN MADE  THEY WERE TRUE TO SIZE.  NOW THAT ARE MADE IN HONDURAS, THEY SEEM TO BE CUT A HALF SIZE TOO TIGHT.  I'M USUALLY A 38 WAIST, BUT IN DICKIES THE 38'S SEEM TIGHT WHEN I SIT DOWN.  I HAVE TO WEAR THE NEXT SIZE UP (40 WAIST ) TO FEEL COMFORTABLE.AS FAR AS DURABILITY IS CONCERNED, THEY WASH WELL WITH OUT FADING AND CAN HOLD UP TO HEAVY WEAR AND TEAR	8
The civilization 2 gold does what most other gold eiditions do.  Takes the game and makes a few changes and this one gives to a nice instrution booklet.  In civilization you start with simple settlers and build a city.  You must build  units to protect those cities and city advangements to keep  your people happy.  Later in the game you meet other civilizations and can  either become allies and trade technologies or enimies and try and take  over your oppents teritory and cities.  This is a game that I would  recommend for everybody.	23
You have to really want to understand this movie if you are to appreciate it. You should be familiar with Zappa's work and be prepared to watch it many times and maybe even do a little research to help figure out some of  the inside jokes and other craziness. Actually makes sense if you  understand it. A testament to Zappa's greatness. The editing job on this  one must have taken ages! MAGIC FINGERS is one of Zappa's best melodies,  and the performances are unforgettable. If you love Zappa, try this one if  you got the time.	6
There are so many water bottles out there today that it's easy to end up with a collection of 10 or 20 before you realize you have nothing to use to clean the very bottom of the bottle.This brush does a great job reaching those tiny corners way down in the bottom of the bottle.  The bristles are flexible enough to be pushed into even small bottle necks so it will work for pretty much any water bottle out there today.  You can be brave enough to drink tea or juice out of your water bottles once you invest in this!	12
I have no idea why this is called a lasagna turner.  It is the best  dishwasher-safe (no wood) spatula I have found, and I have searched high and low for something not too &#34;bendy&#34;  I like to be able to scrape burned stuff from my cast iron pans.  I like it that this is really strong.  (Actually one of these did break off after a couple of years' use, but now I see that they have a lifetime guarantee.)	13
This system has good graphics, but it was released between the time of ps and ps2. Sega whould have waiting  a year. While they do that, they should have upgraded the system. Therefore, this system was not in the competition of gcn, xbox, and ps2. nothing more to say... its a disapointment that i bought this piece of junk for the price of 3 ps1 which is way better. there are only 20 games for this thing. im sure NEVER gonna buy any sega consoles ever.	23
You won't find a better way to start your coals for the Webber Smokey Mountain cooker.  Following directions I had half of the coals I needed nice and white hot for my cooker in about 10 minutes.  It is built better than the ones I have seen at Ace Hardware and other places.  There is an inverted cone grill at the bottom that enables the starter to have more surface area for the newspaper sheets that you use to get the thing started.  You will not be sorry you ordered this along with your WSM cooker!	18
Soooo much stuff packed in the box.  It takes awhile to figure out a way to fit it all in the box so you can close it again (but it *CAN* be done!).  I use the components to compliment my AD&D 1e games.  I have played the game itself, and if you like pure hack and slash, this is the perfect game for you.  If you like roleplay, then the components are a (relatively) cheap way to boost components for your use.	22
Tragic Kingdom by No Doubt is highly overrated. The songs released were pretty good but after all these years, this album is dated and annoying now. This disc is heavy in ska which is no longer popular, no wonder they had to change their sound after this album. Don't Speak was a great ballad but after you hear it 30,000 times you get sick of it. The only track I still appreciate is Sunday Morning, great hook and chorus. This album is considered their masterpiece, but I've heard better.	9
I used this tub after borrowing from a friend because our Four Stage Bath System was so bad it was cutting up my baby's legs.  This was okay - soft all over, no problems like we had with the four stage, however because it folds the hinges tend to leak.  Also, you can't fill it to the level you would want because of the way its reclined.  The back is still very slippery despite the nonslip matt.  We only used for a few weeks before just bringing her in the tub with Mom and washing her that way.	3
"I had horrible eczema on both arms for over a week. It was bad my skin burned in some spots. I went to the Dermatologist and was given a prescription cream. The cream did NOTHING. After another week of this crud on my arms I spotted the Aveeno I had in my cupboard. I thought, ""Why not?"" I applied it after showering at night twice and on day three ALL of the dry spots were gone. I love Aveeno products and no I was not paid to write this. I am a life fan now."	4
There's something about the Chuckit that drives my dog nuts.  She'll bark at anyone holding it who doesn't throw the ball immediately.  Plus, if you get the end of an empty Chuckit near her mouth, it's a chew toy.  So, it's a Chuckit and a Chewit.  This thing can keep her entertained for hours.The Jr (now called 18M) is perfect for active small dogs or medium dogs, and when you lose the ball that came with it (and you will when another dog runs off with the ball), the Jr will fit regular tennis balls.	19
I bought this VHS movie because it brought back such fond memories of the light-hearted comedic movies of the 70s with Cloris Leachman, Karen Vaentine, & many other actors in this farce about city corruption. The finale is something very funny to watch, even now , 30 years later. It is very interesting to see parts of Los Angeles and the San Fernando Valley used to film this movie that still are the same if you drive thru the neighborhoods.  Even if you or your children have not seen this movie before, it will make for a fun & wholesome evening for the entire family.	15
Wacoal doesn't make the style I've been wearing anymore but this new style is a good substitute. It fits well, is true to size and quite comfortable...for a bra, that is. I like this style as well as the old style. Kinda nice to have a change. This is a good everyday bra...should last a long time. Wacoal makes good quality, good fitting bras that wear well. A bit pricey but worth it. I got the white but would like to get the other colors when they become available.	8
I had read that water on some vegetables while in the refrigerator can speed up thedegrading process.  I knew it was a good idea to wash all vegetables before eating.The solution is a salad spinner.  I spent quite some time researching the reviewresults on various salad spinners and this OXO appeared to be the best.I received it and immediately put it to use.  It is everything it was advertised tobe and both my wife and I are extremely pleased with this product.I am recommending it to all of my friends.	13
This is a really good, high-quality product.  It saves money because you can do it yourself.  It also saves time and gas - instead of going to the store, you can just do it yourself.High quality product - very highly recommended.Not very many people nowadays still write paper letters.  But, believe it or not, I still have a few people that I still correspond with on paper and snail mail.  I do prefer snail mail rather than any other way.  This is a good way to have some stationery in which to write a letter on.	17
I had put these on, and my wife picked my guitar to play, and she was confused.They do take some time getting used to.  They don't rip up your hand as much, and if you keep your fingers on the strings as you shift, there is less friction.  This is good, but it takes some getting used to.  I used that finger-tip friction to let me know where I was on the fretboard.  With these, I found myself over-shifting both high and low.I like them, and they sound nice, but i bought some round wounds to replace these when the time comes.	16
"I haven't seen the movie (I usually prefer the books anyway), so had little knowledge of the plot. I really enjoyed the history of how the country was during the Depression and how, basically, lawless the country still was, where people could come and go and even disappear. I enjoyed learning the levels of ""society"" within the circus and the behind the scenes look at the life of performers and workers. Life was hard in those days with no government assistance to fall back on. Aside from the window into a different time and place, the plot was interesting too."	5
I would catch this on TV while late-night surfing from time to time. When it was available on Prime, I would turn it on as background while working on other things. I always got sucked into the drama and how crazy the moms were and how much money they put into clothes and make-up. I confess I watched every episode and felt miserably sorry for the kids in every one. If you don't mind the drama, it is entertaining in just the ridiculous-ness of it all.	0
Girl meets boy and they get married. Nevertheless, the author writes quite well which made it more interesting to me; however, the constant interruptions that she included to keep the main couple apart got irritating! Also,if I had realized that she would include explicit gross sex scenes, I probably never would have chosen this book as I don't think her first book was so overly sexual. I prefer Anne Perry,s type of writing about both love and the customs of 18th century England. Or more like Jane Austin.	14
This item is great for my small business, it may seem a little dated with all the available programs for computers and smart phones, but nothing is simpler than writing numbers down on paper and making sense of your own entries.  The ledger has plenty of pages per month to do daily entries on, so no need to worry about running out of space, an the book itself is held together very well with the binding.  I would recommend this product for people looking for a simple way to keep track of their businesses daily expenses and incomes.	17
I love these patch cables.  They can be serviced if need be, but mine have never needed it.  I've ordered about 3 batches of these guys and I would order them again in the instance that my already excessive pedalboard where to become more complex.  The length of the cable presents limitations that should be expected, and the bulb on the ends may be an issue in tight squeezes.  However there are many cables of much lesser value, which are unserviceable in the event of a breakdown.	16
Not only is this shirt super comfy and cozy, they shipped super fast.  I can't thank you enough and I will order from you again! Kudos!!!  Oh, I washed it with bleach in hot water and put it in the dryer.  No problem.  I'm a 3x but I love big shirts to bum around town in.  My friends want them so I'll be ordering more, decorating them, girling them up, and giving them as Christmas gifts.  Thanks again!	8
Searching for ways to stop break outs i decided to give this product a try. It has a strong smell of peppermint and it makes your skin feel tighter after use. It helped stop my break outs and clear them up. Although it is only 1 oz a finger tip amount will cover your entire face. The product lasted me about 2 months. I decided to use tea tree oil instead just because this product is so high priced but you do get what you pay for, all organic ingredients. Organic is never cheap.	4
"This app really saves me a lot of time. It takes only a second to get an internet price. I'll be all up in Walmart looking at hammers or shovels or bone saws or something and the Amazon app is all like ""Yo dawg, I'll get you that sheeeiit for half price AND I'll ship it right to your house fo FREE!"" When the Amazon Prime benefits kick in it's a joyous occasion. I'm celebrating this app's magnificence with 5 stars. Do it.Do it."	1
I have trouble with hand creams because my hands sweat more than the average person's. As a result, I find this lotion to be somewhat slow absorbing. It almost feels like a thicker version of aquaphor - very rich and emoliant, maybe even a bit greasy. However, I notice that my cuticles are very well moisturized when I use this and the effects last several hours. I suggest using it sparingly. It won't be my holy grail hand cream, but I will definitely use it in conjunction with a more fast absorbing and lighter lotion.	4
Expensive hunk of junk.  Orig. purchase date Nov. 2006, after the first one we'd bought quit working just a little after the warranty period ended.  The 'head' on this Defender has been repaired three times and replaced twice.  If you get a replacement head from them, there is no additional warranty past your original purchase date (even though they sent you a new one!).  Save your money for something else.  Ours is dead again.  We purchased an inexpensive replacement plan through Amazon, but we're done with the Defender-we're throwing it away.	18
This large roll of nicely sticky masking tape was big enough for us to tape plastic over every window in our 150 year old home. You laugh but trying being in -20 weather with a leaky house from the 1800's. The tape did a great job adhering to every possible surface (wood, glass, plaster on lath...). The house is already warmer. I used to have to buy two rolls for this job. I even have some left over.Nicely adherent, plenty of it, easy to rip, stays where I put it. Great tape for multi-purpose use.	17
"There was so much speculation before ""The Passion of the Christ"" opened, and I truly believe the naysayers were just blowing smoke.  Yes, it is a very violent movie, but not gratuitous Hollywood violence.  After all, bludgeoning and cuxifiction are both extreme acts of violence and suffering and this is what is depicted in the movie.  Mel Gibson did an excellent job.  I would not recommend this movie for youngsters due to the violence.  Very mature young teens may be able to handle it."	15
For anyone who wants to really enjoy this five star, most excellent series, you won't see it on this cut down, over edited version.  Obviously the most recent batch of movie hackers have no appreciation for the hard work and supreme talent the origional ROME series was all about.  It's sad to see this happen again, during the first launch of HBO on Amazon.But the uncut disks, producers cut, and you won't be sorry.  Watch this version on Amazon, and you're missing 25 percent of the movie.	0
"I think it was Stephen King who once commented that his short stories (or novellas) were books that just never took enough shape and form to become a book. He tried to tease out more out of the story but there was just nothing more to pull out of the story.""The Babysitter's Code"" is not that. There is plenty more to add to this story. It just builds up to the point where the reader is getting in to the story and then it just.............................ends.Why?Don't know.Frustrating?Very."	14
As someone that grew up in small town America this well written story was fascinating.  Nuclear war is an insane idea, but we live with the possibility every day.  The possible tragedy is explored with what I felt were real people, good acting and reasonable human interaction.  The story line is like one very long novel and being able to watch episode after episode at your leisure with Prime is the perfect way to get the most from this story.  The novel celebrates those that strive to cling to positive moral values in the face of unimaginable hardships.	0
I've never been one to read any kind of romance novels, but since I got my kindle I've been perusing through different types of genres.  I have read several of her novellas, she is good for keeping you entertained.  Fast paced and spicy, they are not for someone who blushes easily.  I really like this one, I love the differences in perspectives from the two main characters.  Worth your time to read and keep writing Karen, cuz some like it hot.  Haha.	14
this is my first petal of  any kind.  I had read that the Wah shoud be your first so I went with that.  glad I did.  this Wah petal is so much fun.  you can make as many cool sounds as your imagination will allow.  It is hours and hours of fun.  the sounds are great.  I have had no problem with performance.  it works as it should.  I highly recommend this petal.  it's price is attractive as well.	16
I was very excited to find a book that not only had great characters, but it was also written by an author who knew how to write. The twist at the end I should have seen coming, but I didn't and it still made perfect sense. I look forward to reading more by this author and more books with Henry Wright. I appreciate a good mystery that doesn't have alot of violence, or to have psychopaths or sex included just to have it and for no other reason than as a shock. Excellent read.Highly recommend.	14
Found story very interesting.  My dad traveled  with the circus five years when he was young, When I was young we went to every circus within 50 miles and I got to spend time in the back where most people do not see, Loved seeing and petting all the animals.  We stayed until cars were all loaded on thetrain. At that time the horses brought the cars to the tracks and then the elephants pushed them upon to the train. My Dad saw all but 2 of the states. I miss the real circus , The ones today are only so so.	5
If your a tradesman or a homeowner hanging drywall this is the tool for you. I've been in the construction business for over 30 years and believe me I know a lot about screwing things. The variable speed is a must and the long lasting Dewalt tool saves you money by not having to purchase another one after the first job you use it on. Where speed and top quality is needed, the Dewalt name and tool comes to the aid. Believe me, buy this tool and you won't be unhappy.Larry Hobson	21
Well I have to say that at first when I was reading about it in AMAZON and checking them out YOUTUBE I was like &#34;yeah right&#34; but I have to say this works great.  I used it several time at home before I take it with me to the range & I have to say it works great!!!!  Makes reloading the magazines easy & fast.  Using them at the range is perfect plus it doesn't hurt my fingers from reloading the mags at the range & it makes target practice more fun.	20
I put a set of these on my Alfa 164 and have been extremely pleased with the performance.  Other standard blades tend to judder and make a lot of noise on the Alfa.  I tried bracketless blades which, besides being ugly, did not work well and left a huge streak of water down the middle.The Valeo's clear my windshield exceptionally well and, just as important, glide like silk with no noise or chatter.  Will see how well they hold up over time but for now they get two thumbs up.	2
Healthy walnuts...the best nut for us per the folks who know all this stuff and from Amazon, their at a good price. I bought 6 bags of them since I use them in a lot for cooking...NO not just cookies.So here's a good healthy product from a well known producer and a good price from Amazon...How can you go wrong?A must buy. I even bought them on the &#34;subscribe and save&#34; program so I keep getting them.I think you should do the same...	11
"My 3 year old son is obsessed with robots! So when you can build robots with magnets, WONDERFUL!He doesn't really use the ""backdrops"" that come with the little set, he uses the magnets on our fridge or dishwasher, which is just fine by me! He does, however, keep all the magnets in the metal tin they came in! I think it's because there's a cool robot on the front. =) The robot pieces are so unique! Not your plain old everyday robots, oh no! You can use radios, lamps, even mechanical cats to build your robots! So fun!"	22

First night didn't catch any mouse. The second night caught one. Third night caught two little ones. On fourth day I heard a mouse in my room while I was sleeping  and put the trap by my door and crumbled a small cookie by the traps entrance. Five minutes later I hear the mouse walking inside and zap! It was a huge mouse compared to the others. So far it's been 3 days and have yet to catch another. Ether they got scared or we don't have anymore. Next time I'll remember to close the basement window .	18
We put it in a doorway that we walk through constantly, I can open it with no hands (i.e. holding the baby)  It keeps out the dog (about 65 pounder) and withstands some jail bar style shaking from my 1 year old.  I can leave the gate open, walking through is a bit narrow for my wide hips, but I don't have to turn sideways or anything.Get it, you won't regret it.  looks nice, easy to install, keeps out the dog and the baby in!	3
this unit is easy to use, read and durable. I had one for 20 years before it finally gave out (dropped once too many times). I bought a digital unit - wont work or quirky if it's too hot, too cold, raining, icy, snowy, and many times not easy to read. There's a reason that all of us have ANALOG clocks in our kitchen - our brain processes an analog dial far faster and more intuitively than a digital readout.Get this - you know you need one. Put in glove box and use once a month.	2
This tubing was much more narrow than any other aquarium tubing that I currently have. It wouldn't work with any of the three air pumps that I have no matter how much I stretched it. Other than that it seems fine - flexible, seems tough and not brittle. But when a product says &#34;standard&#34; and then doesn't work with any of my pumps I think that's a bit deceptive. Looking at the other reviews as well I think whoever is packaging this is just selling whatever tubing they happen to have spools of at the moment.	19
Plain and simple, it works really well. The water just beads off your windows at maybe 30 mph and sometimes you don't even have to use your windshield wipers (although it isn't meant to be a substitute, just a compliment). I completely agree that it increases your reaction time and it is easy to apply. A few minutes to apply this product to your windows can mean to difference between a safe drive home and a nightmare, knock on wood. Stay safe. Your safety is #1, the product is worth it.	2
I have had a few of these and I love it!!!  I ordered their newer model and ended up giving it to a friend.  I have very thick hair and it tends to be puffy and on the wavy side.  After I blow dry my hair, I use this and it smooths out my hair beautifully.  I can also flip my sides back and the bottom length under.  I hope that this isn't going to be discontinued.  It works way better than their newer model!  Please keep making these.  I recently ordered another because it works so well!	4
I was excited to try this game when I saw that it was a tower defense game but, this was a sad disappointment. Even with directions, the game play didn't any make sense.Only one tower can fire one shot. Then that tower is useless. All the while 20 balls fly by it.. I couldnt win one game to save my life...And, that was the EASY mode!The really sad part about this game?  Prior to it being Amazons FAOTD, they were actually charging people $2.99 for this!If I could rate zero stars,  I would....	1
Luckily, I got my expansion pack with Donkey Kong 64,so I didn't have to spend 30 bucks for it. There is a significant difference with the 4 megabytes of extra video memory, but it's nothing revolutionary. However, because quality games like Donkey Kong and Perfect Dark require it, it must be purchased. There are also several games that don't require the expansion pack, but benefit from its use (Top Gear Overdrive, Rouge Squadron). The bottom line: if you're a 64 owner/player, you should probably buy the expansion pack.	23
I use this with a regular land line phone.  You plug it in as directed on the instructions.  To use it you lift the handset and push a button on the earpiece to turn the earpiece on.  The sound quality is very good.  Microphone seems good, nobody has complained they cannot hear me.  Volume is adjustable.  There is really no detectable interference.  There is no head attachment so you must use this over the ear.  That would have been nice.  Sometimes in a hurry it is tricky to get it situated on your ear correctly.	7
I ordered this cable to replace a nice red 7 footer that will work with my LAN hookups, but notmy Line 6 Spider amp to peddle connection???????????.... Go Figure.The cable works great, and I don't have to use the 25' cable Line 6 sent me (25 feet?).I ordered three of these, as every once and a while I need a shorty to run from wall connection to router, or router/wall to computer.It works great, and I have posted a photo of it, as one reviewer said he got a fake, so this is what it looks like in the package.	10
I love these things.  Perfect for a keychain.  Has exactly the tools you need, and nothing more.  Small as you can get to have the tools you need.Funny story, I always have one of these on my keychain and I forgot to take it off when I was getting on a plane.  It was confiscated, so I used my phone on the way to the terminal to order a new one with Amazon Prime, and it was waiting at my doorstep when I got home.  I heart capitalism.	20
this was the first video related item i came across by the floyd. that was about 12 years ago and this bad boys hasn't lost a single bit of lustre in all of that time. if your serious about the floyd this is a mind blowing  must have video. the live shots are spectacular and the interviews are  charming. being an advid collector of live floyd shows i would have to say  that there a few studio touch ups to the music but this still represents a  well captured era of the ever evolving floyd. enjoy.	6
You should pick up at least one of every expansion pack to this game.  They add new pilot and upgrade cards that are quite useful, in addition to another ship.  The model is perhaps the most detailed pre-painted model at this scale I've seen, and certainly the best value-for-money in that regard.Every Rebel Squadron should have a Y-Wing, they are great support craft.  I won a pre-release Millennium Falcon with 2 X-Wings and a Y-Wing.I also suggest you buy TWO of the starter sets, so that you get double dice, spare templates, extra cards, and 6 ships to start out with.	22
Look well made and durable... but if we are going based off looks these things look cartoon blue. These are a pair of work jeans I keep in my car for site visits at power plants and they are cartoonish how blue the darkstone are. The only thing worse than wearing a pair of dress slacks around a power plant are looking like a mark with these jeans.May just need a few washes to dim these out a little bit. Again, quality looks on point though. I will update if there is a fade to the jeans.	8
Having been a devoted fan of Lovecraft all my life (he's my all-time favorite writer), I HAD to buy this book for the Kindle I just received today. It has almost all of his stories ... for only 1.99! That's less than 200 pennies! So far I only read From Beyond, one of my favorite stories of his. I found a few small typos, but that's okay. Editors are not perfect! Every book on the market has a least a couple of errors in them. I'm still giving this 5 stars. It's H.P. Lovecraft! HIGHLY HIGHLY recommended if you're an H.P. fan!	14
This is a great play space for our son! We have a sizable great room, which is child-proofed and gated off from the rest of the house. But once our son started crawling, we needed a safe place to put him while working in the kitchen. We had a regular pack-n-play, but it seemed cramped. This is perfect! It's roomy enough for him to spread out with a few books or toys, and entertain himself for long enough that we can put away groceries, cook a meal, or do a load of dishes. Everyone's happy!	3
I purchased this item and immediatly noticed upon arrival that the slits in which the strap go into are way too small for a typical strap. Way too small, maybe like a third of the width. I just have a normal planet waves strap, and it does not fit. However, it does hold the XDS transmitter nicely and securely. So looks like I will have to get creative with duct tape or something.UPDATE:When attached with rubber bands to my planet waves strap, it stays on pretty snugly. But you need to attach it with something.	16
Been using Aerospace 303 for years. This is an outstanding product. It is a bit pricey but worth it. A bottle goes a long way.I used to use Armor All but this stuff beats Armor All hands down.Armor All leaves a greasy (which likely comes from silicone additives) feel to surfaces. It also does not last very long.Aerospace is not greasy and seems to last much longer after it is applied.Used it on my cars, motorcycle, sports gear, tools and equipment. Good for dozens of things....	20
So far, so good. The lid is very tightly screwed on. The bristles, so far, are holding their own. I've only owned it a week, but with available replacements, I'm not too worried about them bending/breaking super early on.The button to release the soap is very sensitive. It's very hard to release just the tiniest of soap. I ordered this to not actually clean dishes, but clean out my pedestal sink as the bowl is rounded and oval and very hard to clean with a traditional brush. I'm two washings in and very happy.	13
"...and this dvd prove it. Classics songs, an amazing good taste in selecting and performing those songs, which are in the heart of many ..Gilmour have the charisma of those who have everything clear....Of course, tracks like Confortably Numb (one of the 10 songs i loved more) and Wish you Were Here doesn't need too many words, but check out for the MARVELLOUS version of ""Don't"" and the SUBLIMEEEEEE!! ""Sonnet 18""....This DVD deserves of all the attention. Don't miss it, please, and you'll be a happier person..."	6
I went to st Thomas and I went to the real blackbeards castle when I came home from the trip I was playing with the ghost radar and all of a sudden the word castle came up that really freaked me out!! And then a few minutes later the word structure came up that just freaked me out!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Now I'm scared a lot!!!!!!!!!!!!!! This is real!!!!!! It's worth 1 dollar, if you get scared easy don't get this it's definitely real for sure not kidding!!!!!!!!!!!!!	1
I have a lot of high end instruments, and I live in New England so proper fretboard care is a must - especially with ebony and other woods that are prone to cracking and drying.This stuff is fantastic - MUCH better than lemon oil, dries a lot cleaner and doesn't leave any oily residue on the board at all. An hour after it's applied it sets up and doesn't get on your hands. I apply it on occasion with the strings on (I use Elixirs) and have never once had a problem.The best few bucks you'll spend on guitar care. 5 Stars.	16
I purchased this as a gift for my father. He is always working on projects away from the house and we have to make several trips back and forth. Since having a stack of three of these units in a 5 gallon bucket, we are more organized and make less trips. I like the added touch of having holes for the screw drivers on top and that the stackers can either fit inside each other to take up less room, or turn them by 90 degrees to effectively stack them up if they are filled with items.	21
I bought this 21-23 quart container for my dog's 35 lb. bag of dog food. A mathematician I am not. So, the food didn't fit, but I liked the container so much I wasn't about to send it back. It is now my new, and best, kitchen trash container. The seal is so strong, I can't smell a thing. Trash bags fit nicely and the container fits perfectly under the counter. If I had more room in my kitchen, I'd leave it out because it's cute and sleek. As for my dog's food, I bought the 30-33 quart IRIS (see review).	19
These earrings are really pretty.  They look exactly like the picture on Amazon.  I got these on a Lightning Deal for $40, which I thought was a good price for gold earrings.  Unlike some reviewers, I like the 8mm size.  It is big enough to be seen clearly, without being too big to overpower the look.  I bought these earrings to match/coordinate with the Duragold 14k yellow gold beaded ball necklace.  They match perfectly.  So glad I got these.  If you are looking for a simple and classic look, then I would definitely recommend these earrings.	8
"So amid all of the intentional spelling (tiger = tyger/tygre, bright= bryght) and tiger references (tyger-honey or tyger-pussy or tyger-mate.....we get it! they are ""tygers"") there was a solid story here that was very sexy. However it got a bit repetitive. It was also a bit short (but thanks to the other review I was sort of expecting it, thanks!) The only things that bothered me aside from the spelling and repetition was that it was short. I mean, not physcially short...but if you ignore all the repetitiveness there isnt very much there. So, 3 stars."	14
I found this book to be a very touching story with an interesting setting. The time period, the place, and the characters come to life in this wonderful story.  I don't want to give too much away but if you enjoy a book that makes you feel as though you are there...this is one!  There were times while reading this I wanted to throw a few punches, and other times I wanted to stand between August & Rosie, and times I just wanted to pat the hand of the older Jacob.  I'm sorry I finished this book...I will miss these characters.	5
I began using this application to track my food.  It became my ultimate diary.  I can add updates from my Kindle Fire, my Smartphone and my laptop.  It all synchronously updates regardless of the device used.  I wouldn't normally pay for any app, but this one could easily get money because it is worth it.Try using the Bar code scan function often.  It is so easy to do with your Smartphone.  I add my own recipes too.  What more could you want from a tool that truly shines?	1
We keep several types of tape around our home - and masking tape is always one of them. This roll is wider than some I have used in the past, and is a very nice size.Besides &#34;masking,&#34; it is effective for temporarily holding posters up on painted surface where it won't peel the paint off when you take it down. In fact, way back in High School, it was the ONLY type of tape we were allowed to use for this purpose.Sticks well, comes off easily. What's not to like?	17
This app definitely deserves a WOW.  I have been doing cryptograms for a very long time.  I started with the one in the daily newspaper.  Then progressed to the magazines and then to the JUMBO books and even to computer software for cryptograms.  Enigma is the best.  I have only had it for three days, but I have found all the settings, which sets it up to my liking. I tried two other apps, but they come nowhere near Enigma.  Thanks, EC Software Consulting, Inc.	1
The Quarter Easel Whiteboard and Flipchart is perfect for  Sunday School at my church. I like the double sided writing surface and angled feature for good viewing across the classroom. I just wish I could get one for every classroom. The board is very sturdy and well built. It does take two people to set it up and secure the legs. The double-sided white board makes it a reversible writing space. It also will hold the Easel Pads 27 x 34 Inch. I highly recommend this easel whiteboard for a small office or  classroom use.	17
"Joseph's Sugar Free Maple Flavor Syrup is pretty good stuff for putting on Italian cakes or rolls.  Sometimes I eat this at night and develop the worst form of gas anywhere.  I can't help myself and have to let it ""out"" constantly, I don't know if something is in here that makes me act up.  I was ejected from a concert hall after my stomach couldn't help itself.  Just a warning to diabetics or regular sugar eaters, don't try to swallow the whole bottle in one sitting."	11
I got this tub on the advice of previous reviews and have to agree it's great.  It is big, I store mine on it's end in our linen closet and set it on the kitchen counter for baths.  My girls slipped around a little on the infant side until I put a burping cloth under them.  The wet fabric helped keep them in place.  My only complaint is the drain plug must have been stuck in backwards.  The force of the draining water blows it closed so I have to prop it open by sticking a pair of scissors through the hole.	3
It's intended for easy cutting the paint. A nice thing Meguiar's been doig is having the scale shown on the label. This is one of the lowest indexes available for paint cutting.For the amount it comes (16oz) it should last for about years to come using on a single car.I'll try it with my PorterCable to figure out if it was a good purchase and this will be updated. If the case, I'll buy from other brands like Wolfgang or Black Diamond (better rated but 2x the price). Anyways, wait for the update.	2
I bought this one to replace the softworks model that we wore out (after about 5 yrs).  Pros on the green one:  Clear lid, removable spinner top liner for cleaning.  Cons:  it's not as big as the softworks model, and we cant get it to spin as fast.If I did it over, I'd go with the softworks model again (the white one).  Even though it doesn't break down as well for cleaning, it spins faster and holds more.	13
I have this attached to my rails on my back porch.  I just planted a bunch of geraniums(red and white)and put the pot into the holder when I was done.  Very sturdy-that was one thing that I was afraid of was that it was going to fall over. But the brackets are very firm-dont think I will have a problem with them this summer.Nice product. It looks better when you get it. When I saw it on Amazon it looked very cheap but not when you get it.Might buy a couple more to match the one I just got!	18

I bought these thinking 'What a nice color'. Little did I realise that the dye used for this color has a really unpleasant smell. I washed them repeatedly in my very efficient and eco-friendly Asko washer, but the smell remained. If the jeans were mixed with other laundry, the odor would contaminate the other clothes. So, they were returned to Amazon. Thankfully, they accepted them.(This, in many years of online purchase, has been my only return).I wish I could say something better, but the truth must be told.	8
"I own my own detailing business and use this product exclusively for three purposes.  1. As a clay lubricant for paint contamination removal and 2. Putting the finishing touch on vehicles that are freshly painted and/or have had recent body work.  I love the fact that it's body shop safe, and 3. Prepping my polishing pads.  Otherwise, for anything else I use Meguiars synthetic spray detailer that wipes off even easier and has the added benefit of putting a protective ""film"" over the vehicle.  Another great product by Meguiars."	2
"By no means is this the best documentary on legendary movie actress Joan Crawford it is nevertheless an interesting insight into how Lucille Leseur became Joan Crawford and went from nothing to being the highest-paid actress in Hollywood during the 1930's. With some rare interviews with those who knew her ""Always The Star"" concentrates more on Joan's acting career than her personal life. Having shot over 80 films, numerous television guest-star spots, commercials and winning the coveted Academy Award, Joan Crawford is cemented as one (if not the best) actresses in Hollywood history."	0
The picture is slightly misleading. This is only the mounting bracket - it does not come with any wiring. But is is well designed to let you securely mount the end connector of a 4 wire flat cable. The bracket is flat on one side, and curved on the other. The curved side fits well on the tube of my trailer hitch. The connector on the end of my T connector fits well, and the weather cap comes out through a slot in the bracket. It sure beets having the connector flopping around!	2
I've been on board since season one.  The writing is just not as good as the early seasons.  The commentary and the extras are the only thing that saved this set for me.  The commentary was better than that jokes in the episodes.  I don't know how much longer this is going to last. If this is the last season, and Comedy Central doen't renew, They  went out on a good note.  If you can put up with less laughs and just watcing the characters on screen, it's a so so set that is passable.	0
I'm happy to patronize another company than Campbell's, who is fighting against estate taxes for themselves.At first I liked this soup a lot, but after a while I've gotten tired of it, and it's not as enjoyable. I don't really have any specific complaints - it seems pretty good for healthiness and quality.I pick out the bits I don't like - the red things and celery - but that's not a ding on the soup.Overall it's a nice soup, pretty good taste, rice and carrots go well with the chicken. Good, just not crazy about it.	11
I like the Exhumer. It is the best blade changing wrench on the market.  The angle is perfect and it gives great leverage. The claw is super . It  grips nails like a vise. Even if you lose the head , it still pulls them  out lickety split. I like the idea of a bottle opener but I don't know if  it works. I never drink on the job , so I never have had the opportunity to  use it. The only prybars I like better are the Shark grip bars. They are in  a class of their own.	21
I got this for my baby shower and I LOVE-Love-Love it.  I put it on my kitchen table after filling under sink, and drain it from the easy-drain spout right into the sink when I am done.  My baby Amelia has been in it since week 1 and she is 3 months and still loves it.  She fits perfectly in the newborn side, and I feel safe she won't slip down.  I can easily bathe her alone without problems.  Highly recommended, especially since the tub grows with you and your baby.	3
"I loved the first 90% of this book.  Whenever I opened it to read, I fell right into circus life in the 1930s, as told by the 93-year-old main character looking back on his life of 70 years previous.  My complaint is that the ending seemed rushed and contrived.  There were lose ends that didn't make sense.  For all of the reality of the first part of the book, the end seemed too fantastic.  Did the editor say ""Wrap it up all ready!""?  I think this would make a TERRIFIC movie--just wait for the rights to be sold.  A good summer read, too."	5
My family had used this product for many years but I had not been able to find it in a long time.  I have old feet, yep, there it is...I have old feet.  They have developed cracks and creases, callouses and snags.  My husband is a diabetic and foot care is of utmost importance for his wellbeing.  Pretty Feet & Hands is a great exfoliant for both of us.  I recommend using this at least once a week, though it can be used daily.  Bye-bye rough, dry, cracked, snags and such.  Hello to smoother, younger, healthier feet!	4
This is getting a little gimmicky - 3D glasses and images on the cover, 'Superband' status with all these big names - and nowhere near as powerful a return from the first album. It's an okay rock album, but something I cannot sit down and directly plug my ears and brain into. I have to have it as background noise while I am working. Don't get lost in the marketing gimmick of 'Hagar and Satriani', but still worth a shot if you have not heard the first Chickenfoot album. If you have heard the first album, don't get your hopes too high.	6
I don't know what I expected but this pizza wheel is large! But it is also the best we've owned in the past 25 years. It rolls easily and with the sharpness of the wheels blade it'll cut through just about any kind of pizza you want it to.The grip (like on all of the OXO Good Grip items) is excellent, and it is made to last. High quality construction, great blade, and grate grip, and great price. What else can I say.I would recommend it to anyone.	13
I had heard of the health benefits associated with Bragg's Amino Acids but should have done the research first;* is higher in sodium than my Lite Soy Sauce.* this contains MSG.* I prefer the taste of soy sauce to this product.TIP: if you are concerned about your sodium intake but still want to use soy sauce the *LITE* Kikkoman Soy Sauce actually has LESS sodium in it than their Lower Sodium Soy Sauce.For my tastes/purposes this product did not have any appreciable health benefits over my lite soy sauce and therefore I would probably not purchase this again.	11
The scent is so well done, I could smell it while it's in the wrapper! It should be a room fragrance as well until you're ready to wash with it lol....I had the lavendar and jasmine and it's the first time I've ever seen  a CLEAR NATURAL SOAP. I thought that was fascinating. The scents are awesome and my fiance used the lavender soap for his dry skin since he tends to get rashes when he scratches himself. and he says he likes it so far. Worth the cheap price so give it a shot!	4
This allows you to hold the case in a drill, after de-capping, and spin the case against some steel wool instead of spending more money and buying a tumbler and media to clean the outside of the case. No chance of getting cleaning media trapped in the case when reloading and raising the pressure through the roof. It also allows you trim the case to the correct length, while that isn't needed so much in revolver cartridges like the 357 mag, it is needed in the automatics like the 9 mil and rifle cartridges.	20
I used this in Vietnam, where the local butcher, Hang Kau Pung, asked me to use my gas grille for his yak.  After butchering it, we used the grille to smoke it and had a problem when the ribs did not fit on the Weber 3601 Rib Rack.  I had 5 Weber Rib Racks so they were useless and we had to put the cooked meat on the fly dirty ground near treated sewer water.  I suppose if you are using pig Ribs they fit but be weary of larger meat animals.	18
Well...After 5 FAILED attempts to get an UNDAMAGED outfeed  table delivered, i'm going for number 6.  I should give up, up this item is handy and i cut a lot of plywood. (i should just give up and build one myself.)It seems that no one can get the largest table part delivered in one piece. All 5 have arrived damaged in one way or another. The last attempt, direct from Delta, was the worst.  The part was shattered in several places, almost beyond recognition.Needless to say, I'm VERY disappointed.	21
After reading some of the other reviews I really don't have much more to add.  However in my opinion it's as good as the other's have said and then some.  I own three of these 3G concert versions, and this is my favorite because of the jam at the end with all three.  It's too bad they didn't make that a tridition with all three, but the other two are damn good and well worth purchasing on their own merit....A good collection to own if you're in to exteremly hot guitar licks....	15
I love having cut fresh lettuce around for salads and things, and soaking it in water makes the lettuce really crisp, so then I use the spinner to dry and store it, and it works perfectly. It's very sturdy, but I used the bowl as a mixing bowl once and the inside got lots of visible scratches. Also, the top doesn't come apart, and a piece of lettuce got stuck in there and I any get it out, or find any way to wash between the two pieces. It comes apart somewhat, but not completely.	13
Suave is value for the money.  It's not watered down like some other inexpensive brands.  Thick and rich, smooth and silky.  I just love how my hand just glides over my skin in the shower, like I had just buttered myself all up!  It's the same sensation as showering in very soft water -- only I live in an area with nothing but hard water.  I feel clean and moisturized when I'm done.  I've always been a fan of Suave products and this one just reaffirms my loyalty.	4
These are nice jumbo corners that didn't make our table look too hideous, but at some point your baby's going to learn to pull them off!  This didn't happen for us for a while and I really think any other brands would have the same problem, so this one's the best in the market.  My daughter fell and hit her face on the corner guard and her mouth still bled, though the damage would have been much worse without the corner guard.  It's definitely better to have these than nothing at all.	3
If you need a label where you don't want the background to show, then then these lables are for you.  Believe it or not, I use these labels for my home brew beer bottles.  With a clear label I can make a custom made label on my carefully crafted home brew that makes me look like a brewing professional.  No more white background on my beer bottles.  No sir - now my beer bottles look professional.  Kidding aside I love these clear labels and recommend them to those who wish to hide the background.	17
I use Sharpie Fine Point Permanent Markers for lots of things -- but I especially like to use them for writing checks. The concentrated black color provides, I feel, a measure of security. And, because so much of banking today is done on line, when you want to see a canceled check on your bank's web site, this ink makes the details that you've written easier to see.They are also great for addressing packages. Once again, the ink gives an extra degree of security.These are good pens!	17
If you're a bass player and use a pick, you need one of these. If you are a bass player and *sometimes* use a pick, you *really* need one of these! I bought one for every bass and a spare.Wedgies work better on bass than guitar, because the strings are thicker and usually parallel. I have a guitar wedgie on my gibson explorer, and it is a bit loose because of the angled headstock spreading the strings--but the bass ones stay put.Really, these things are great.	16
My dog destroys ANY toy he gets, so I have to be very picky when I do buy him something. Most Nylabone products are safe (we have had some bad experiences with some) but this one is great! I have a puggle who is 30 lbs and he just loves this. I was happy to see a new toy added by Amazon in the nylabone division, and it is a great price. At $5, I can replace these often enough when my dog starts to wear them down. He loves the dinosaur however, he carries it around with him everywhere!	19
KRSONE (BDP) DOES IT AGAIN.DIDN'T THINK HE COULD COME BETTER THAN CRIMINAL MINDED,BUT YOU KNOW WHAT HE DID.TRACK 1 THROUGH TRACK 10,ALL CLASSICS.SHOWS VERSITILE STYLES ON A HIGHER LEVEL.THE TEACHER TEACH,BUT IS DEEPER THAN THE  AVERAGE PROFESSOR. CONSISTENT WITH THE FIRST ALBUM,LYRICS ARE BANGING,BEATS  ARE BANGING.IF YOU DO NOT HAVE THIS ALBUM,YOU ARE MISSING WHAT SO MANY  RAPPERS ARE TRING TO ACCOMPLISE,BUT THEY FAIL.CHECK THIS ALBUM OUT AND YOU  WILL UNDERSTAND WHAT LYRICAL FLEXIBLILTY IS ALL ABOUT.NO ONE DOES IT  BETTER. KRSONE IS THE GREATEST.	9
this is one of my tried and true beauty products; it never fails me. The other night, after using a different (and much more expensive) cream for over a month, I reverted back to using this, and my gosh, I fell in love all over again! I highly recommend this product. It's rich and gives the right amount of moisture without a greasy feel or look. Due to it not having SPF, I use this at night, and use a BB cream during the day.	4
I've had this since the day it was released and it just doesn't get old. One video includes all the bands videos up through Perfect Drug (including the controversial Happiness in Slavery video!). The 2nd video is filled with live material and backstage footage. If you're a big NIN fan like me you should love these vids. I only gave this 4/5 stars because the quality of the live material isn't as good as it could have been (but its still good and not bad by any means). This video set was a great addition to my collection.	6
These hole saws are good for a DIY'er or for casual use.  It's nice to have all the sizes available and organized in the nice case.  The two bits help out with the larger sizes too, better than any other similar kit.  The saws do dull, however, when used frequently.  If I had to frequently drill holes of a specific size I'd get a different kind of drill bit.  Also, these do not drill metal well and will burn up and dull immediately, as I learned when my buddy uesed a bit to drill a hole in a stainless steel sink.	21
I like the medium version of these picks a lot, & I just ordered some hard ones at the 3.1mm thickness--which is pretty thick, by the way.  So only plan on using these on basses and acoustic guitars unless your electric has an unusually wide neck and heavy strings.  These soft ones have too much give in my opinion, which makes them more difficult to handle--it's great that they eliminate pick noise, but these softer ones want to cling to the strings and require the player to make too many adjustments.  My verdict:  go with medium or hard version.	16
This has been a great set for me to use in my garden.  I particularly enjoy the numbers on the one trowel when I'm planting tulips and other bulbs in the fall (particularly since I've lost my bulb planter!) and the other two, well, I just use them all the time.  Like another reviewer said, you really cannot use these in thick, heavy soil because they WILL break.  However, if the soil is that heavy, you should be using a garden shovel anyway to loosen up the soil.Just a very nice set, rivals my solid stainless steel ones!  Recommend!	18
I do a lot of field work across the world and have heard nothing but good things about these sandles - however for me, I can't even wear them. After 1 month, they just stank. Now, I don't have particularly smelly feet. And can't smell any other shoes, but these are bad. Others people with the same shoes tell me that as well (although they still like them). And I found them fairly uncomfortable. I remember that Teva's sandles, when they first came out, also smelled, and then they made them different. Oh, well.	8
Very happy with this product.  I initially bought it to try and charge a dead battery, alas it wasn't able to bring the battery back from the dead, but I don't think anything could have.I've used it to restore a charge on a battery for a garden tractor (after the winter), and for a car that hadn't been driven for a couple of months.  Worked very well in both cases.  Very handy and versatile battery charger to have around the house - it charges 6v and 12v batteries, as well as standard lead-acid and high-end AGM batteries.	2
"I was so excited to get this for my 1yo, and it is a great toy...  My 1yo & 3yo love it.  BUT it has an issue with batteries!  When it arrived (with included batteries in a ""try me"" box), the batteries were dead.  It's not being played with at a rate that warrants having to change the batteries once or twice a week.  When it begins getting low on power, the music sounds warped, like an old warped record, which is dreadful!  Perhaps we got a defective one.  I don't know.  I hope this isn't happening to others."	3
I have many blu-ray's and was excited when i saw that The Passion was finally coming to blu-ray! I was not disappointed, although it looks mildly different, you can see every nook and cranny. It looks amazing. It is a little grainy at times, but it doesn't steal the show like other blu-ray titles i have! I would definitely recommend this title to any one wanting to see a great movie on their big screen tv's. Definately don't pass this up!	15
These are high quality and far better than the band type.These are clean looking and fit over the ridges on the pipe instead of crushing them. They tighten up with a screwdriver or wrench and really sinch down tight.Because the dust collection hose is made with a continuous ridge and not seperate sections. You will have to cross over some ridges on the collection hose but, it still comes out clean.Forget the old rubber hose type clamps and go with these you wont be sorry. Now get out there and clamp some hose.	21
first off i'm 4'9, 34 dd, an its hard to find a great bra that actually fit.now because i'm heavy on top, i have the bras that have skinny straps that dig into my shoulder leaving me sore and a mark. this bra is heaven, it fits like the picture.now it doesn't give much lift if that's what you, want but it supports an don't poke you (wire) or cutting into your shoulder.now far as making me size look smaller... yes! and when i wear shirts it don't leave those lines.i will buy more!!!	8
As many martial artists say, the Top One Feiyues are better than the Tiger Claw Feiyues, but considering I've been wearing these Tiger Claw Feiyues for about a year and half, the quality is pretty good. The rubber on the bottom hasn't been worn out yet, and this review is coming from an amateur wushu athlete who practices on concrete (and likes to drag her feet when she walks). I'm still using them now, and I think I can actually keep using them for another year and a half.	20
"I purchased this system at a ""Bed, Bath, and Beyond"" store. I used it, and I really did like the whole Facial Sauna System. However, not too long after using the system, problems did occur. The moisturizing sponge attachment wore down & eventually fell apart...And there's really no way to order a replacement. The other problem was that the actual Facial Tool eventually stopped working. I thought perhaps I needed to replace the batteries, although when I put new batteries in, it still did not work. So the only thing left that still works is the Facial Steamer."	4
This should be a movie and William Defoe has just got to play Kelly/Clark!This is a definate departure for Clancy to focus closely on a single plot line, but he pulls it off expertly.  If you haven't read the earlier books, read them first.  This one is intended to fill in the dark background of the character you've already come to appreciate - and what a dark background it is!  And who wouldn't want to step into his shoes vicariously, brutally deal with some of the scum in the world (without any remorse), and get away with it all?  Sign me up!	5
"This album is absolutely perfect.  Every song is great in every way; the songwriting, musicianship and attitude are all just right and compliment each other perfectly.  Elvis Costello may be dignified and old now, but anybody who's heard this album knows just how punk he was back in the day.  Just listen to the lyrics on ""Lipstick Vogue"" or ""No Action""...you don't wanna mess with this guy.  Also, he's the only person who has EVER looked good in those glasses."	9
After reading a lot in magazines about this scrub I decided to give it a try. After all, it's so cheap that I had nothing to lose. I have been pleasantly surprised. I really like the smell and my face feels really smooth after using it. When I combine it with an electric facial brush or a face sponge it works even better. I don't feel it has encouraged any breakouts in my acne-prone skin but I'm careful and prefer not to use it whenever I feel my skin is breaking out.	12
While not being familiar with the rest of the market, I am impressed by this product.  It is like the metal book holders which I have used before, the ones that keep the pages open.  But it works with documents.  For a researcher, this is a helpful tool in order to type commentary at the computer while retaining the documents vertically.  Set up is simple.  The only problem is that the string keeping the documents in place sometimes is liable to come loose.  Other than that, I really like it.	17
Although I would call myself a sci-fi buff I truly enjoy a show that challenges our mindset.  Years ago (probably 58 yrs.) a comic strip had a detective-Dick Tracy- with a wrist watch that was also a camera and a communication device.  I have lived long enough to see something similar to it come to life.  Long before the first spaceship went into orbit Flash Gordon another comic hero was circling the distant planets in a spaceship.  Sci-Fi for many is boring for me I enjoy seeing the imagination of men/women become reality.	0
"For anyone who is acting as their own IT department, this app is a must.  I never thought I would need something like this - then I had a router go wonkie, then my youngest daughter needed Wi-Fi in her room, then I checked into a hotel that had ""free"" Wi-Fi on the easter egg plan....  Simple and easy to use, even for relative newcomers with lots of useful information in a nice graphical format.  Adds are annoying but not obtrusive. A must for your toolbox."	1
the 4 newer songs on this must have release are awesome olivia - unfortunately personal problems hurt the success of the &quot;comeback&quot;. luckily a few years later we have &quot;back with a  heart&quot; classic olivia and a tour! fate twists back!  &quot;not gonna  be the one&quot; is a definite should've been hit and she should consider  re-cutting it for her next cd. &quot;i need love&quot; is a great dance  song and the ballads soar. plus you get most of the classics - what more  could we ask for but another new album!	9
I didn't expect to like this cream as much as I do.  It's an excellent value and I don't plan to be without it in the future.  Cetaphil now sits on my bathroom vanity and is used as a routine moisturizer for my face, elbows, arms and any other moisturizing needs.The scent is clean and very minimal so it doesn't iterfere or offend.It hasn't caused any breakouts and seems to hold moisture longer than many of the high-end moisturizers I've tried.Excellent product and a terrific value.The glowing reviews here were my reason for trying it and I'm very glad I did.	4
Hey jerks, do you play guitar?  Well, if you do, you need strings.  Well, you could be an experimental guitarist playing a stringless guitar.  If so, you can stop reading.  If you use strings, you should buy them your damn self.  While you're at it, buy ten sets.  Seriously, are you a child?  Always have extra strings.  D'Addarios last a long time for me, and they sound good.  Also, they're on the bottom end of the price range.  Buy some strings, douchnozzle.	16
"Being a former ham radio operator in the 60's, I appreciate the features GE put back in their ""SUPERRADIO"" that used to be standard.  The best is the tuned RF stage that pulls in distance stations with ease.  Second is the dual power feature: a line cord comes built in, and in battery mode, it takes 6 ""D"" cells so they last a very long time.  Third, Two loudspeakers give amazing soundquality and volume.  It's hard to believe you can buy this for under $50.00! This is a great radio and I will be buying more forChristmas presents."	10
Mars fans will love this book.  I have to admit that when I first read it I found it difficult to follow all of the characters.  It was Mars itself that kept me going because I loved being there with them.  My second read cleared most of that up for me.  I have managed to get through Blue Mars once but I have not been able to find the energy to go on to Green.The raw red planet is what appealed to me and still appeals to me.  I love visiting it through this novel.	5
If you ever wonder how a 60 year old soul/pop/rock star can still draw the attention of 150000 fans, then buy this dvd.  Tina is pure showwomanship pouring energy and sympathy over a raving dutch crowd. The director keeps  our attention focused on the whole setting and leaves us wanting for more.  The Greatest Hits format of the concert is wonderful and the sound quality  is great!  Also note the lip synch that the stage screen and live Tina  accomplish in River Deep, Mountain High and the coreography involved in the  Goldeneye number. Great dvd, BUY IT!	6
I've had one of these for a while now that replaced a P-3, a cheap tin hand cranked one and an old electric countertop model.  This opener never loses its grip on the can rim: I can't count the number of cusses I've  saved since I quit using my old ones.  I have never had the wheel  &quot;skid&quot; off the rim yet.  I even take this one camping with me.  (Gotta open those beans; remember blazing saddles?)Oxo really has built  the better mouse trap.	13
I love this little guy!  I use it for just about everything!  I make salad dressing all the time, and yesterday I made topping for a cherry crumble.  Easy to use, easy to clean!  I never put any of the parts in the dishwasher, I think its ok to do so, but from past experience, these sort of items tend to wear out more quickly if they are subject to the heat of dishwasher drying, so I don't do it.  This is definitely one of the handiest little gadgets in my kitchen.  Great for gifts too!	13
This is perfect.  It comes with some small alligator clamps and also comes with wires that can be more permanently installed.  It charges and cycles the battery so it won't overcharge.  Cord lengths are long enough and the unit has a nice led system to tell you what it is doing.  This is exactly what I needed for my car which sometimes spends a few weeks in the garage without being used.  Tired of coming home from business trips to a dead battery that needs to be jumped (then replaced).	2
This dryer doesn't blow hard or hot enough to straighten the waves out of my hair without a lot of extra styling, which is time-consuming. I have pretty fine, thin hair, so I think this dryer should only be good for people with very straight hair that only want to dry it, not style it. I tried using a styling brush, but the style didn't hold due to the air from the dryer being too cool. I had to use a curling iron. It does leave my hair soft and fluffy, but I wouldn't buy another one.	4
Who would have thought that a saw blade could make such a huge difference?Although others had recommended the Forrest blade, I'm pretty cheap and had trouble justifying the cost.  No retailers near me offer the Forrest blades so I had never seen one in action.  I finally caved in and bought one for my new cabinet saw after using another blade with disappointing results.I couldn't believe the difference.  It cuts quietly and smoothly through even 8/4 hardwood.  It doesn't burn.  It leaves a beautiful finish that's ready for gluing.It's worth it!	21
I have to agree with the earlier reviewer that mentioned the bad sound recording on this DVD.  The visuals, of course, are as wonderfully Tina as expected.  I don't understand how and why the sound is so &quot;strange.&quot;  ... even though their are two versions (of the sound) from which to choose.  I'm not sorry that I purchased it, however.  This is my favorite Tina Turner concert.  The selection of material is perfection and the energy comes across like a volcano erupting.  I love Tina more than ever, and look forward to her next DVD.	6
Sound quality was on par with my $29 Caldwell units, and those run about the same size overall. having to run batteries in both sides a negative for me, especially when you have to work so hard to get each side open. i never got the one side installed at all, so label me only partially biased in sound quality.There are better options, and if they weren't on sale, it would be a shame to waste the money on them. Back to Amazon they go. Next guy gets 2 free batteries, I cant get the things out.	20
I got one of these for Christmas, and I LOVE it! At first I wasn't all that fond of it because the only way to purchase apps and such was to use the nook store, but recently they had an update that added all sorts of Google apps, including Google Playstore. It has great graphics compared to previous nook tablets. It is great to read with, but the books are a little pricey.Now that it has Google Playstore and great graphics, I can't think of a reason for somebody NOT to get it!	10
This was and is a riveting movie.  When I saw I at the theatre, it kept the audience quiet through most of the movie.  The brutality was not held back and matched the biblical description.  Reading and seeing are two different things and is the reason it's rating was meant to keep children from watching.  The one debatable scene was one regarding St. Veronica's encounter with reason which is a catholic belief and not necessarily biblical (Gibson is or was catholic).  If you want to relive Christ's crucifixion, this is it.	15
I have tried pretty much every kind of deer management products on the market, and these repellents are marginally useful at best.Most repellents smell strongly and wash away after even a light drizzle. This product tries to correct these shortcomings. It does stay on much longer and the smell is much fainter, but herein lies the problem: it does not deter deer very well. Eventually, only the corner of my garden protected by theBird-X YG Yard Gard Ultrasonic Animal Repellerremains completely unmolested.I do like the battery-powered sprayer and plan to keep it for the regular repellents after this bottle is used up.	18
I have owned many pairs of this exact trimmer and will continue to do so. I lose them every 3-4 months. I have no idea how or why but i do. So i continue to purchase more. They are tight gripped, the spring is of high quality and will not wear after repeated long use. The shears are sharp and can get into tight spaces (what we need it for). For $11, this is one of the best trimmers you can buy. Enjoy and happy trimming	18
For the price, it's worth it I guess. If you just want to try it, go for it, that's what I got it for. It sounds nice and adds a cool tone to my setup, but after playing on a few more expensive chorus pedals I would suggest saving up if you really need a chorus pedal. But for the price it's not too bad.Oh, and the casing isn't like a wimpy plastic knife plastic. it's pretty durable. Albeit don't throw this on concrete and expect great results but it could stand a few stomps.	16
What an unbelievable work of art.  This book not only grabs you and pulls you in, with wonderful characters and writing, but you find yourself lost in the time and place.  I am currently about a fourth of the way through War and Remembrance....it is equally splendid.  I first read Marjorie Morningstar and fell in love with Herman Wouk's style and mastery of the storyline and character development.  At times when reading these books I am incredibly sad, other times uplifted, and yet other times amazed.  Absolutely one of the best authors I've ever read...and I have read alot of books.	5
My dermatologist recommended this brand of spf 30 for daily use because I have Rosecea.  I love this brand because it gives me a nice fresh glow if I don't wear makeup and it is easily worn under makeup because it's not greasy.  I've tried many other brands and probably my 2nd choice would be Eucerine's spf30 for face.  But I still say this is the best because it doesn't feel like you've got sunscreen on.  It seems to stay on well during exercise too, because I alway put it on when I go for bike rides and never burn.	4
"terrible supergroup schlock.  If this is their best cd, I wonder how terrible the others are.  mind alteringly dumb lyrics that are mindless pervade this cd, by the official ""prog rock supergroup.""  supergroups tend to suck hard, and I would say that this band blows more than most.  Avoid at all costs, there is much better prog music out there.  I was previously a fan of the work these guys did in other bands before, and I am extremely dissappointed that something so aseptic could be brought forth by them.  Maybe they didn't have that much talent in the first place."	9
I use the 33 quart container to store 25-lb bags of organic whole wheat flour. I just lower the bag in gently and then close up the lid. It keeps the flour fresher longer, and makes it easy to shift around the kitchen to where I need it. I've never had a problem with it, and it has made my life so much easier.It worked so well, in fact, that I'm ordering another larger one to keep dog food in (which I guess is the original purpose) for our new dog!	19
The Oral-B professional precision clean brush heads work perfectly with my Braun Oral-B Professional 3000 electric toothbrush.  The brush heads are very compact, fit around your mouth easily, and surround your teeth in a cup-like manner.  They don't have any special cleaning / polishing bristles like other Oral-B brush heads, but they clean very well regardless.The packaging is a very simple small cardboard box, that's easy to open.  Inside the box are the four brush heads, each in their own individual package.All in all...a must buy for those who have Oral-B electric toothbrushes.	12
"This is a fun game, and it scales really well from 2 - 4 players. My friends and family have really enjoyed playing this. The scoring rules are what really make this game great. Having the lowest number, no matter what the color, be the player that loses makes for some great ""take that"" blocking opportunities. Also, for parents of children, my 6 year old was able to play this with me with only minimal coaching. Also, the box is designed well to house all the components, which are also very well made."	22
"The reviews from ""Booklist"" and ""Publisher's Weekly"" are a little misleading--the book really is more uplifting and not as depressing as the plot elements they have focused upon.  This story leads the reader into the rich and complex world of traveling circuses, circa 1930's.  The journey of the young man reminded me of Clyde Griffiths in Theodore Dreiser's, ""An American Tragedy"", the relationship between Marlena and August reminded me of the dynamics between Sophie and Nathan in William Styron's, ""Sophie's Choice"".  But, in spite of these analogies, the book still isn't depressing!  A good summer read, you won't be disappointed."	5
when given the choice, i always buy oxo. it's the most comfortable for my hands. this pizza wheel is great, sharp, and cuts clean. and i found it for a steal at ross dress for less at $3.99!!!!!! would i buy it at amazon for the inflated price? uh, no. even if i didn't find it at $3.99, i would have bought it at bed, bath, and beyond for cheaper with their 20% off coupons. amazon, if you want to stay competitive, price your items lower!	13
Was looking for a game my 3 year old could play.  It's a little complex at times on very easy due to narrow gaps, but I think he had fun with it as did I.  No excessive permissions, opted out of the social plugin.  Graphics are fun as the walls give a shift in perspective making a 3d feel as you look done.  Recommend for something to pick up and play quick without feeling like you have to play longer unless you want to.  Check it out while it's free!	1
When I first played this game, I thought, &#34;Not too bad of a game.&#34;  Now that I've played it a few times, I'm not as excited as I was when I played it the first time.  It was a good game, I think I lost interest mainly because it was the same ole thing over and over again, just a little more challenging than the previous round...  It can keep me busy while I wait in line or at the doctors office though. :)	1
We need more games with this much style. I absolutely love the retro look with the hard-edged, pixelated characters but with the added blooming it knocks it out of the park. It doesn't hurt, of course, that the game itself is fun to play. It's like a cross between Pac-Man and its knock-offs (Lock 'n' Chase comes to mind).If anyone is annoyed with the touch screen controls, you can connect a Bluetooth keyboard and use either its directional arrow keys or the WASD keys to control the character.  :D	1
This book did an amazing job of transporting me to another time and place. Reading it, I really got a wonderful sense of the times during 1931 as well as the brutal daily way of life for people working for a traveling circus. I loved how well the characters were developed.I would have given this book a five star rating however the main love story felt a little too obvious and tired. The underlying love story is how the main character falls in love with the circus and, more importantly, an elephant.	5
I bought this as a cheap fix for my Polk DVD/CD player, which refused to play disks that worked on other machines (lots of screen freezes).  I inserted the cleaner per instructions, followed the instructions on screen but it failed to complete the cleaning process.  Ejected, tried again, same thing.  On the third go, the cycle was completed.  Unfortunately, DVDs continue to freeze.  So, maybe the Polk is a dud.  In any case, the cleaner didn't fix it and it's tough to know which product is faulty.	10
We have two of these that we rotate and they work just fine for us. We also have the contoured changing pad by Simmons. True, they do seem a little small straight out of the dryer (the cover stretches straight across the top of the pad), but after one changing our baby's weight shapes it right into place. That's really never bothered me. And considering how often they are washed, they are really holding up well.My only complaint (and why I didn't give it five stars) is that they could be a little softer.	3
"You've got to love Lacey Mosley's voice.  As the diminutive frontwoman of Flyleaf, Mosley's vocal range is anything but.  She can wail with the best rock frontmen, blasting out lyrics of anger and confusion, and then quickly turn the tables and deliver something swooning and seductive.  She can hold your heart in her hand tenderly. Or crush it with a single squeeze.  Listen to ""All Around You"" and  ""I'm So Sick"" back to back and you'll catch my drift.  This eponymous debut, though plagued with many typically debut album problems, works more often than it doesn't, and showcases the group's potential."	6
I love OXO utensils and have many of them.  But I looked for quite a while for a meat tenderizer and missed the review that said not to put this tenderizer in the dishwasher.  Pound raw meat; wash it in the dishwasher in hot water, right?  The tenderizer I was replacing was aluminum.  Now this one looks like old aluminum--it's gray and nasty looking. Not something I paid extra for to get stainless steel.  It's totally not up to par with the usual OXO utensils.	13
I like this mattress pad cover b/c it's much easier to put on than the Evenflo one I have.  My Evenflo one you have to tug, pull, and stetch to get it on and even then it's not on perfect, a real pain.  It does &quot;pill&quot; a little after being washed, but it doesn't concern me, you put a sheet over it anyway.  My 5 month old daughter's diaper has leaked a couple of times overnight and the mattress stayed dry, that's all I need!	3
This is a fun record... anyone buying this record looking for salvation will probably be disappointed, but if you want a fun, funky, dance record, then this is it... I love it personally, and it always hypes me up when I listen to it... just listen to the wicked... beats on Revolution 909, the soothing waves on Fresh, the funky bass of Around the World, the discoy feel of High Fidelity... it's great fun, and if you like dance music, you need this in your collection... if you like music you need it, for some variety... it's great fun, pick it up...	9
I put this on almost everything that has an electrical connection. WAY&#8230; Way&#8230; Cheaper purchasing this tune then buying little packets every time a bulb needs to be replaced, or spark plugs.When I change plugs I put this on, fixed a poor radio connection putting this in the plug (Never flickers, or turns off now), putting some on bulbs insures an easy removal in the future. If you have had a stuck bulb you know what I'm talking about.Great stuff every one should have some laying around!	2
1.  This is a very nice looking, well designed product.  It's simply to assemble, it's easy to adjust and performs the task for which it was intended.  I'm not sure sure or keen on the elastic cord in the sense that I'm not sure how long it's going to last, but so far so good.2.  The only issue folks have to consider prior to purchasing this product is whether they have the desktop space for it.  Review the dimensions; it may be bigger than you think.	17
With its new-look packaging, Tazo also reformulated the Awake tea blend. The old blend was strong, robust, and biting. It was by far my favorite bagged black tea. The new blend is weaker and maltier; it is sadly reminiscent of standard Lipton tea. If I want Lipton tea, I'll buy Lipton tea; it's a lot cheaper than Tazo.I know that many people found the old blend to be too bitter. Tazo apparently decided that they'd gain more customers than they'd lose if they toned down the flavor. I don't know if they're right, but they've definitely lost me.	11
My 7 year old begged me to order this after they did one in his class. So, when I saw the price on this drop, I was excited. Until it arrived, and I realized that I still had to order the actual caterpillars.......for an additional $5. The overall concept is great, and my kids are excited for the bugs to arrive, but as a parent, I felt a little misled. Perhaps I didn't read the product description well enough..so next time I'm in the market to buy bugs, I'll make sure to do that.	22
I eat pretty simple lifestyle...I'm vegan...and this program has trained me to see my calories. I barely use it now. Only time I do is when I need to find a new food item being incorporated into my usual meals and how much I can eat of it and to calculate my calories burned by my varied workouts. Counting calories are very important! Whether on the cookie diet or vegan; you will gain weight if you don't watch your calories! This is a very simple and great tool for weight loss.	1
They work just fine and fold up nicely for storage.  Good enough.There have been a few instance when all four legs of a saw horse didn't touch the ground at the same time.  No big deal.  A little weight fixed the problem.  Just like any other saw horse.Regardless, what I really like about these saw horse legs is how easily I can set them up and tear them down.  I don't need them every weekend, but when I need them I really need them.  Oh yeah, these ones are sturdy too.	21
I love these books but this... this was not my favorite. To be fair, this man keep SO many plots and characters in the air at any one time that there just had to be a point where he'd have to start wrapping things up. Logically, I know this to be true. My advice for the brave reader who is thinking about taking them on is to not worry about losing track of details. Martin does a great job of reminding the reader who everyone is as he goes... just keep plugging along and you'll be fine.	5
Complimentary Review Copy Provided by Author. Demons, Vampires and Humans at war, Check. Vampires on the side of humans, Check. Plenty of action, Check. Romance between vampire and human, Check. Hot sexy scenes, Check. Tension between Sire and Childe, Check. All the boxes keep getting checked but, seriously, this is one great story that keeps the reader on the edge with action and sexual tension from page one until the end and leaves me, for one, eager to read books two and three in this Blurred trilogy within the Demon Age series.	14
"Skillets previous albums ""Alien Youth"" and ""Collide"" was very catchy and wellperformed records with lots of emotion ,heaviness and melody but with this they have really set a huge landmark in the world of alternative rock. ""Comatose"" is packed to the limit with huuuge choruses and emotional lyrics mixed with huge string arrangements and crunchy postgrunge guitars! The biggest surprise of the year?! Skillet is definetely nominated!! =)Wonder if their next record could be better.....hardly bigger anyway!! ;)Thumbs up guys!! (and girls)Highlights: Rebirting, The Last Night, Say Goodbye"	6
I can't understand how people can see this as a recruiting film for churches. Frankly, I worry about people who liked this having custody of children or pets. If anything, it made me want to avoid churchgoers as I avoid Nazis and Klansmen. If I were a Martian arriving on earth and this was shown to me to explain this major religion, I would recommend having the earth vaporized before this dangerous insanity spread. Jesus said some admirable things about mercy and forgiveness, but you won't find them in this sick piece of trash.	15
This shaving cream choice came from a recommendation from a reviewer of shaving creams for wet type electric shavers.  It has been the best of the many, many, gel and skin lotion types that I have tried over the years, and I wish I had known about it long before I read this recommendation.  I bought this from Amazon, but I have since noted that it is also available at my local CVS pharmacy store along with a different Neutrogena Men Skin Clearing Shave Cream that is featured for sensitive skin.	12
If you like Kind Of Blue, you are in for a real treat here. Adderley, Miles and Blakey were and still are such big stars in the jazz world that their work is in a class of its own. The fact that they are collaborating here is an added bonus. Adderley's joyful sound and Miles's Emotional Charges Harmon Mute is absolutely exquisite on this album. Best cut would definately be Autumn Leaves, since Miles's work on this track almost brings a tear to my eyes because it is so beautiful.	9
"Too Short outdid himself on Shorty the Pimp, which is arguably his best effort behind Get In Where You Fit In. Its what you would expect from Short, boasting of having women and making/having a lot of money. But he does take a serious approach on here with ""I Want To Be Free"" and ""So You Want To Be a Gangster"". The best track IMO is the surprising ""No Love From Oakland"". Throughout, Shorty the Pimp is infused with plenty of P-Funk samples, but then again what can you expect from classic Too Short."	9
My dermatologist strongly recommendsAquaphor Healing Ointment, 1.75 Oz (50 G), (Pack Of 6)BIG time and so do I!!  Use it on anything from chapped lips to burns!!  Take the little ones everywhere you go and now there's one for babies!!  Cosmetic Hint: Excellent to use under eyes in lieu of antiaging products now and then and this was also recommended by my dermatologist too!!  Lasts a long time too - look into Amazon's Subscribe & Save Program for this item ->**MIRRACLE STUFF!!**	12
Bernadette Peters remains one of the most striking performers on the musical stage, with a palpable presence reaching for miles. This concert features some of her old gems (&quot;Unexpected Song&quot; &quot;Raining in  My Heart&quot; &quot;Time Heals Everything&quot;), a wonderful selection of  Sondheim songs, a radiant joy, and a self-assured sense of humor (Too bad  &quot;making love alone&quot; wasn't on the video). &quot;Hello Little  Girl&quot; is perhaps the only weak moment in the show for my tastes, but  cannot even begin to dampen my enthusiasm for Ms. Peters's delightful  abilities.	6
The Rate goes from barely there to a massively overdriven buzz tone. I'd consider the usable range from 0 to about 9 1/4. The real treat is the Tone switch. It's almost like having two stompboxes in one. The footswitch action is smooth, quiet and nearly effortless. The effect is there, then it's not. There are no audible artifacts as it switches in or out. It's hard to beat this box at any price. If the unthinkable happened I'd buy another one in a heartbeat.	16
Dogs, Androids, Firemen, &amp; Tomatoes. Thats what Daft stands for or so they say. This is some of the best music to listen to the waves, horizontal, vertical, sprirals, tunnels, &amp; ripples in the music. You hear it a lot better when you are frying, (just a tip). Check it out when ya fry, (call a radiostation and ask if they will play Daft Punk's Around The World). I say 100% of this album is good. Any questions e-mail me at yuckplace@hotmail.com .	9
Smackdown:Just Bring It for the PS2 and Smackdown 1 and 2 for the PS1 are better. But it is nothing compared to WWF Raw for the XBOX. Raw for the XBOX is better than any of them. But if you have'nt got a PS2, XBOX, or Gamecube yet this is a must get game. Gameplay is good it just takes a day or maybe a little more to get use to. If you want to save money rent it and smackdown 1 or 2 and see which one you would want to have the most.	23
We were having a grand time with this toy, and my dog enjoyed running the extra distance.  That was until I handed it over to my boyfriend who &#34;Chucked it&#34; as hard as he could and our tennis ball was lost forever... Ok, so that's not really a problem since you can put whatever kind of tennis ball you want in there, but buyer beware: You must understand physics to avoid losing your dog's favorite tennis ball or possibly chucking a ball into a passing car.  It really depends on where you live.	19
These are the best designed and sturdiest  dividers I have seen. The cost also reflects this quality.  I would LOVE for Wilson Jones to make these with pockets in them, then they would be absolute pure perfection.Thick plastic, these should stand up to the abuse doled out by my family members.I had no problem with the template,  and I LOVE that they do not make you create an account in order to download them.  If you want to preview them just google &#8220;Wilson Jones templates&#8221; and follow the link, you can test out how easy they are before you buy.	17
These will really hold your passages open, and they stay on extremely well. Nonetheless, if you have oily skin, I suggest cleaning your skin first with alcohol or something. Best to remove it with an alcohol-soaked Q-tip. If your skin gets raw on the bridge of your nose, you can put a tiny amount of lotion, vaseline, or something; but only put it right in the place that's getting sensitive, on the bridge of your nose. It won't stick in that tiny spot, but it'll stick everywhere else and stay on.	12
This is the second time I purchased a bra on Amazon and the sizing is not the same as the bra in store. I got fitted for Felina bras and was told that I am a 32DDD in their bras. When I tried the bra on in store, it fit perfectly so I decided to order on Amazon because the store price was way more expensive. This bra has so much space in the bust area that I cannot possibly wear it as the 'girls' will jiggle with any step that I make. Terrible!	8
Mistress to the Beast is one of my all time favorite books of any genre.Eve Vaughn created a tale that drew you in from the beginning. The relationship between Hunter and Lila is complicated and beautiful.  Even with Hunter's less than upstanding characteristics, you feel a sort of empathy for him and you want him to come out on top.  Lila provides the perfect contrast to Hunter's brute demeanor by being a loving, understanding partner.  And did I mention the love scenes?  HOT!!!!  I would recommend this book to any fan of ir/erotica.	14
I drink this tea twice a day for it's benefits. I just drink it straight with nothing added and I actually enjoy it! With this and my breakfast smoothie, I no longer drink coffee.  And best of all, with this tea and my twice dailyBragg Apple Cider Vinegar Organic Raw -- 32 fl oz, I have no more inflammation in my body!! I always had inflammation, especially abdominal, and I'm so amazed at how great life is without inflammation. The combination of those two products has also helped my whole gastro-intestinal environment as well as peristalsis, I am so pleased!	11
A great app for storing your passwords securely. Available for Android, PC, Mac, and iOS - though it isn't cheap and it really doesn't need to be expensive for what you get. I am a software developer and have worked with encryption quite a bit myself. The work that went into this app doesn't warrant charging 10 bucks for every platform you use it on. I wish they had a buy it once and use it anywhere policy as at 10 bucks, that would be more than fair.	1
Same product as Purina One, different bag. I even had the kibbles to compare side by side and they look identical (shape, size, color, smell). Our cat would not eat the Purina One so we got him this one. He won't touch it either.Ingredients list is almost identical, I think they swapped a 2 ingredients' places in the line, to make it look different when really they are about the same amount and the same formula.Rip off! If your cat loves this, get Purina One, you'll save about half the cost!	19
I hadn't put out a feeder for several years, but a little green hummer kept bopping over the the patio this past week whenever I was outside.  He'd hover and dart around the chimes and lights, making it obvious that he was looking for a feeder.So ... I ordered two of these because I wanted some that were small, affordable and had a bee guard.Thanks to Amazon, they arrived very fast and my little hummingbird has already found it.He's happy and I'm no longer feeling guilty.These are easy to fill and just the size I wanted.	18
Another Amazon reviewer whose opinion I respect recommended this brand of steel cut oats. I have been wanting to try steel cut oats. These are tasty. You can cook them for 10-20 minutes depending if you want them firmer or softer. There's a recipe on the package which won an oatmeal taste contest. I add soy milk and cinnamon to the oats when they've completed cooking. Brown sugar and pecans would be a tasty alternative. These are a delicious source of whole grains and one serving supplies most of you daily whole grain requirements.	11
Thank you for the nice ear protectors!I have already put them to the test and they work great since my ears have become more sensitive over time and a product like this is like heaven sent.I did not mind the battery installation being a little difficult since maintenance of your equipment requires you to know how.It did come apart easy enough once you know where to install the thin flat screwdriver to separate the ring from the cup.I like it's ability to compact to take little room in a range bag by folding up like a ball.	20
I had hopes when I bought this one, as I have usually had success with OXO products.Sadly, this grater was not one of those successes.  I didn't pay a lot for it, around $10 and it lasted about 6 months.  But the plastic gave way on the sides, so now I only have the side that is for finer grating.  Which I don't do that often.  The cracks start at the corners of the steel grating piece and eventually they just break completely.It needs a stronger design and then it would be much better.	13
I have one of theses I got at a local store.  Used it on my Trailmanor Travel Trailer.  It fit nice and sung.  I later found out that the key is universal and fits all the same coupler locks.  Not to safe there.  Got a new TT and it has a 4 1/4in lip.  This would not fit on it.  It measures about 4in from lock end to lock end so your hitch must be 4in or smaller.  Overall, it's a nice cheap lock but won't stop someone who really wants to get it.	2
I bought this blade in December 2009.  I've cut everything from MDF, Plywood and solid wood with it.  It's finally time to send it in to Forrest in NJ for sharpening (curb marks on fence side of the wood).  It's going to cost me $21.50 for the sharpening and $12 to ship it back to me.When I get it back I'm only going to use it for cutting solid wood.  I'm going to buy a cheaper blade for cutting MDF and plywood.  The cuts from this blade have to be seen to be believed.	21
i'll make this short and sweet...this album is amazing.  ...i'll take you back to '84.  new music was growing...Valley Girl...that movie with the fanatstic soundtrack...the plimsouls &quot;million miles away&quot; jammin in the bar scene.  i was sold.  the ultimate record from the early eighties that still reigns true today.  great words...great music...great production...yet the sting of that pure raw garage band sound.  simply put?  get the CD...you'll thank me when you do.  as soon as you hear &quot;oldest story in the world&quot;, you'll thank me again.  i thank peter case everytime i jam...everywhere at once.	9
I've been buying this product at Costco for years.  It is a fantastic product.  Lots of great beef flavor, not just salt like a bouillon cube.  The uses for this product are virtually endless.I saw that this product was a few dollars more than Costco, but with the free shipping, what the heck... save a trip to the warehouse madness.  I should have paid attention to the size.  This is about 1/2 the size of the Costco version.  Because this review is based on the product, not the price, still 5 stars.  But I won't buy it again here.	11
I have been trying to change the water more frequently (like I'm suppose too) and it is helping my tank but I was using a lot of chemical .. I ordered this because it was such a better price than my local pet store.  And WOW they carefully pakaged it to make sure all my items were safe just in case it did leak (Which it didn't) this will last me a while and was cheaper than my local store (Even saved me a trip to the Store) High 5 for me!	19
"This was Roy Orbison's last album, which came out shortly after his death.  It went on to become his best selling album ever.  No doubt the publicity surrounding his death helped sales, but a lot of it had to do with ""You Got It"", which was Roy's last hit single.  ""You Got It"" is a great song, and there are several other fine songs here.  I especially like ""She's a Mystery to Me"" and ""The Comedians"".  This album makes a good final testament to the greatness of Roy Orbison.  Recommended to Roy's fans."	9
This is the best game I have yet to play.  It took me six months to finally defeat,figure out and fight my way to the end of this game.  This game was like a very suspenseful movie that I was controlling. Many times in the game I was actually sweating from fear. You don,t know what,s waiting for you around each corner, waiting to jump out at you and scare the crap out of you. Even my family and onlookers were startled or to afraid to play this game because of the  realism captured in enormous worlds and creepy CD sounds.	23
This is a handy little tool! It makes nice, neat mortises if you take the time to set up correctly. For straight-forward mortising, it's a snap. More challenging situations require some ingenuity and patience, but it's worth the trouble. Glad I read the reviews....mine was bent in shipping also. The motor fan housing was mashed right down on the fan blades. Just took the housing off and laid it flat on a table and carefully bent it back where it belonged. No problem. They do need to pack it more carefully.	21
I bought this for my husband because he really liked the idea of a self-cleaning razor.  It worked okay for a month or so and then broke.  He sent it in for repair and it came back working properly.  A few months later, it broke again. Again it was fixed.  Props to customer service for this.Since we were already going broke paying for the cleaning solutions, when it broke a third time, we decided it wasn't worth the hassle and bought a different one.	12
Got this to replace my thin spatula that is slowly disintegrating.  It's not as good as my beloved utensil, but it works.  The blade is very thin and slips under eggs perfectly.  The only complaint I have is that the blade is uniformly thin. My old spatula has a thin edge then the blade slowly widens, providing support.  This OXO spatula is not as stable, flexes easily and can snap, sending food flying unexpectedly.  It takes some getting used to, but I have found it to be a suitable replacement for a utensil no longer available.	13
It seems after all these years, DM is finally comfortable.  That is what this CD conveys.  There aren't many tracks that would pack a club floor.  The mix is phat but minimal, almost stark.  The campiness is gone.  They have progressed from the old school analog synths, to more rich, complex, and deep sounds and percussion, fusing it all together with soothing vocals and harmonies.  Growth.  Experience.  Life.  These are the ingredients of Ultra.My favorites:  &quot;Barrel Of A Gun&quot;/&quot;The Love Thieves&quot;/&quot;Home&quot;/&quot;It's No Good&quot;/&quot;Useless&quot;/&quot;Sister Of Night&quot;/&quot;The Bottom Line&quot;/&quot;Insight.&quot;Other cool bands:  De/Vision, Distain!, Agnes Poetry, Iris.	9
I tried this. It didn't work for me but it might work for others based on all the good reviews it has on amazon. It's probably only for certain hair types (maybe shorter and less oily hair). My hair gets oily quickly and when I use this the day after a shower, It doesn't feel clean. It leaves a sticky feeling in my hair and it still looks oily. It also weighs my hair down. The only plus is it smells nice. Powder dry shampoo may be another option, but I haven't tried that one yet.	4
"By far the most vocally gifted (if, unfortunately, not most successful) member of New Edition, Johnny Gill, whose voice can either be buttery smooth or deep and growly, keeps his new jack swing to a minimum here and opts for more of a red-hot loverman persona, and it really gives him the best chance he's ever had to make the most of his voice. He really gets sensual here with the beautiful ballads ""Maybe,"" ""Take Me (I'm Yours),"" and ""4 U Alone,"" though every song is a high quality, well-written and produced piece of work."	9
I have bought these from other sellers. Bad experience with other sellers. But not this one!!!!!Tips: If they take longer than 1 minute to absorb water. They are old stock. Happened with other seller.Some are bad stock with Fungus Gnat eggs mixed in while processing the pellets. YUCK Gnat larvae eating my seeds. Then they turn into Fungus gnat flies. Yuck yuck!  Not this seller!So basically, I in the future have learned my lesson and will remain loyal to this seller.No I am not making this up. You can see my other reviews on the bad ones.	18
People would not call fly casing &#34;Easy.&#34;  Like golf, it's a skill that one can spend a lifetime mastering.  Some inexpensive all-in-one fly outfits use &#34;level&#34; taper line, meaning that it is the same thickness throughout.  &#34;Weight Forward&#34; line like this is heavier at the front end than the back, which makes casting easier.  I've used &#34;Double Taper&#34; line in the past, which has weighted portions at both ends, allowing it to be reversed when worn, but I never seemed to get around to reversing it, and this tape seems to suit my casting needs better.	20
I like this brush as an alternative to curling irons and wands used on my slightly longer than shoulder-length hair.  I had one in highschool but I didn't like it.  I though 30 years later, the quality would have improved.  I was right.  You have to take the hair in smaller sections and the curl is not defined like with an iron. It's soft, flowy curls.  However, within hours, my hair was flat.  So, unless your hair is shorter and curlier, I would not recommend if you want real curls that last.  It is NOT good for fine or thin hair.	4
I'm very happy with my purchase. After seeing a lot of negative reviews due to seal problems I hesitated to buy this. The reason I did buy it was because someone found a fix for the issue. Turns out the fix is not needed. I guess the manufacturer replaced the gasket because I have no problems whatsoever with air leaks. This device creates a perfect seal. Buy this! This is an awesome gauge with dead on accuracy. I highly recommend this to anyone in the market looking for a gauge. I mean come one it's only 10 bucks!	2
The worst part of making Quinoa is the rinsing part.  And it can get messy with all those tiny grains.  My strainers were not fine enough to prevent some from falling through the screen.  Saw some reviews saying this was good for quinoa.  I have used it several times and it works perfectly.  I've always had good luck with Good Grips OXO brand.  Another great buy!I am not sure if it is available cheaper in stores as none of the stores in my town carried this item.  I would check stores first to price compare.	13
While Miss Paltrow is acceptable, Ms. Beckinsale truly becomes Emma. This rendition is superior to the glossier Paltrow version largely due to the much superior casting. The Harriets do not even compare...this Harriet is  shy, pretty, and reflective. The Harriet in Paltrow's version looks like  the dark-haired one of Cagney and Lacey (I don't know, or care, which is  Cagney or Lacey); she overacts terribly. Ms. Beckinsale's version is also  far superior in the &quot;finer&quot; touches...period behavior, language,  etc.	15
I'm Italian and didn't quite understand where the Wedding aspect of this soup was. Its a little too salty and tastes like spinach and fennel water. Which isn't horrible. It's just not something I'm going to crave.I think the Italian sausage could play more of a role and they should definitely increase the celery and add some mushrooms. Some rice wouldn't hurt. It's definitely missing some texture. The bits are all small and soft, this is a soup that needs the &#34;Rich and Hearty&#34; treatment.	11
We have busy almost-two year old twins who are fascinated with the many window blinds in our house. I didn't want to spend a fortune, but needed a quick fix. These did the trick, easy to install, and keep the cords just out of their reach. They do pop off from time to time, but are easily replaced. I've purchased several different brands, and they are all about the same. I wouldn't spend extra money on ones that claim to do better than this type.	3
read a few of the below reviews and you will get the picture: these are the best portable headphones for iPod use, hands down.  They sound incredible, and are best for working out/walking with an iPod.  NOTHING compares. Not the ipod ear buds, not $300 isolation headphones that go in your ear (i wasted big time and money on them)...nothing.  If you only buy two headphones in your lifetime, but these for your ipod and a pair of Grado SR60's/80's for home ipod/stereo use.  YOu will be happy you did.	10
I bought this product to tether my lifeproof to me in the wave pool. I used it along with a lanyard to keep my phone on me the entire day. The quality is &#34;Good&#34; however I have seen better ones in the past. I would recommend this product for anyone who wants to tether anything with the ability to add a strap to it to anything else. This would also be useful for creating custom phone &#34;Jewels&#34;  (Those silly little things people attach to their phones just for looks)	7
Although this isn't the lightest thing to carry, it is very serviceable! Ever since I purchased this play pen for my grandson, it has been used every weekday. It goes up about 8 a.m. and down about 4:30 p.m. It still looks as new as the first time we used it. I like the netting one the sides and the padding on the floor and rail. Also, you don't have to be a rocket scientist to set it up or take it down. And, it is bigger than the beds that turn into play pens in the Graco line.	3
This is the best tasting honey I've had since I was a kid.  Raw honey has anti-viral, anti-bacterial, and anti-fungal properties. It promotes body and digestive health, is a powerful antioxidant, strengthens the immune system, eliminates allergies, and is an excellent remedy for skin wounds and all types of infections. Raw honey's benefits don't stop there. Raw honey can also stabilize blood pressure, balance sugar levels, relieve pain, calm nerves, and it has been used to treat ulcers. Raw honey is also an expectorant and anti-inflammatory and has been known to effectively treat respiratory conditions such as bronchitis and asthma.GO ORGANIC!	11
One of the first games released for the Dreamcast, House of the Dead 2 is an instant classic.  The game is identical to the arcade smash with the inclusion of exclusive Dreamcast levels, and the graphics and detailed zombies will leave your mouth watering.  The voice acting is pretty bad though, making the voice acting from the first Resident Evil look like Shakespearian acting, but that is overlooked by the shoot 'em up action.  A light gun is strongly recommended, but the standard DC controler works just as well, somewhat.	23
I hated it from the beginning to the end.  The plot was too predictable with very little surprises.  The lines were weak and uninspiring.  You come to a point where you literally want to see Jesus die so that the suffering would end for the viewer. Talk about flogging a theme, this one wins, palms down!Again I got caught up with the hype and controversy, regarding this film.  I made a promise to myself that this would be the last film that I shall purchase, before I see it first, so help me God!	15
First off if you are looking for a quiet fan, go somewhere less because this is not what you are working for. As the name says this beast is a WIND machine, it generates a moderate air flow with low volume on 1, a moderately high air flow( close to that of the medium sized Vorandos) and a decent amount of noise on 2, and this thing moves mountains and sounds like a hurricane on 3. I highly recommend for those who need large air flow and a good noise level while they sleep.	13
Great for winter weather, stays loose ,,workable ,in New England winters, -5  usually 0 degrees where I live in Ct. Hose was used in my garage,,temp did get down to zero once  ,,worked well. I like the color  not black,,  easy to find !However its heavy! Not super heavy ,,but  you feel the weight, but needed!  Goodyear made in Asia.I  use this for auto work, happy with the quality ,,toughness!!  Its long  suggest 25 feet for home owners  --unless your Bentleywhich has a long wheel base  -never mind Bently , Mercedes ,owners  never work on their cars  ,they work --on us!	21
I love this machine.  A cousin had tried a couple of other brands including one about 4 times more expensive and had to return both of them, so I read the reviews very carefully.  This one is easy to use and it works.  I followed the instructions exactly. The ice cream is great.  I did freeze the ice cream for an additional 2 hours after it was mixed as the manual suggests.  Works perfectly. Yumm  It doesn't make a lot, just a little over two pints.	13
Roy was a west Texan,raised amidst the blowing sand,rattlesnakes,oil rigs,and women eager to break your heart. Like Buddy Holly, it all shines in the timeless music that he made. This CD is as close to perfect as it gets,as far as come-back albums. The production is absolutely great,and while I love all his older stuff,this is in a whole other league. Music by another Good Texan--buy a copy and put it with the SRV and Buddy Holly.	9
I'm so happy when I find games that require some concentration, thinking, and is not too complicated.  This is a fun game for the entire family (our youngest plays it without using the &#34;Destination&#34; cards).  This game is really just a fair, fun play that anyone can catch onto.I really like the quality of the board, the style of the cards, and that it actually all fits into the box for easy clean up!  It would've been nicer if they used wooden instead of plastic for the train pieces.  But still a great game!!	22
I have 3 50 ft. yellow rubber Goodyear hoses, but wanted a shorty for my portable compressor. The first time I hooked this up, it blew one of the ends off...turns out the crimp collar to hold the fitting to the hose was never put on one end. Amazin' Amazon replaced it, no problem, but it's still an extra trip to the post office to return it. Anyway, it's a decent inexpensive hose, but a little stiffer than the rubber ones. Fills the bill for portability.	21
I ordered a 32F. The band seems looser than my others and was riding up in the back when I tried it on. A 30 would have worked well. I did not notice any itchiness or stabbing from the wires like others have posted. However, the cups give my breasts a cone shape and that is not something I find very flattering. Also, this bra did not have any tags (sales tags) other than the one attached to the hooks, this is something I expect when ordering something new. I will be sending this back.	8
Compact, stylish, and very comfortable.  Currently one of the only headsets known to work well with the HTC Mogul.  I wear it all day and never run out of my charge, and sometimes even forget that I am wearing it because it is so lighweight and comfortable.  Amazon has top pricing on this product too.  I could buy two here for what I'd pay full retail elsewhere.  Sound is clear on both my end and the receiver's end.  Great product and great value.	7
Let me start by saying DO NOT BUY STINGER!!!  I bought 2 from Wally World and both are dead within a week.  I mean the light is barely visible already and it is no longer attracting insects.  I bought them because they were less expensive basically to save a buck.  I ended up throwing them away and buying 2 of these to replace them.I already have been using a Flowtron 1 Acre in one corner of my house for the past 4 years and it is on all the time.  It has been incredibly reliable and effective.  These are the only Electronic Insect Killers I recommend.	18
This was the second potty we bought for our son, who is almost 3.  In one word - horrible.  I had a lot of hope that, with all the excellent reviews, we'd find success with this one.  The basic issue is the splash guard, which really doesn't work at all.  Pee still goes everywhere.  I'd love to find one of the old-fashioned potties with the high cupped splash guard - but that's nearly impossible.  If I had known that this potty would be no better than others I've tried, I would have saved my money.	3
I have bought two of these after trying two other brands.  This unit has three advantages over the two others.  First, it is very easy to lift the tray to clean or replace the filter media.  Second, it is very quiet as long as you keep the water level high enough so the water doesn't have to drop a lot to the water's surface.  Third, it is safe in that it can not auto-siphen all of your aquarium water onto your floor if the seal fails...this has actually happened to me with a below-the-tank unit.	19
Having not been to the place where other folks have tried this, I'm guessing the market is a lot of the charm with this tea.  Its ok, but its not the greatest tea I've ever had.  It is spicy, and its sweet, but I prefer to control my own tea sweetness.  I'm happy that others have found a tea they enjoy, but this one just isn't it for me.  I will finish my box but not sure if I will get more.	11
I DON'T SHOOT THAT MUCH SO THIS THING WORKS GREAT!&#34;Hoppes BoreSnake is the fastest bore cleaner on the planet. One pass loosens large particles, scrubs out the remaining residue with a bronze brush, then swabs it all spotless with a cleaning area 160x larger than a standard patch.&#34;&#34;Add a few drops of Hoppe&#8217;s No 9 Lubricating Oil or Hoppe&#8217;s Elite Gun Oil and your gun&#8217;s ready for storage.&#34;&#34;The world&#8217;s quickest, three-step bore shine.Extremely packable.Available for rifles, shotguns and pistols.Brass weight on the pull cord is stamped with the size.Machine washable.Patented one-piece design.&#34;	20
Just received this unit, and I'm very happy with it so far. It is easy to assemble, sturdy, and most importantly has a very simple design which I anticipate will be durable into the future. My previous pressure cooker was a complex affair with springs and components tucked away in plastic housing so that they could not be accessed. This design, on the other hand, is much more simplistic, which is a very good thing. It cost about 1/4 the price of the cheapest PC that I could get in local stores (including postage), and is a preferable design.	13
I am always trying to keep the dogs away from the garden and short of putting up an entire fence they just wont leave it alone. I will be honest I was quite skeptical about how good this product would work but I ordered it anyways. Boy am I glad I did. They have stayed away from the garden ever since I laid it down. The only time they went close to it was after a hard rain but once I laid down another layer they stayed away. Great product that I would highly recommend!	18
I love this can opener. My old opener was an ancient Swing Away, the only kind I've ever bought for the past 30 years.  Decided it was time for a change and ordered this opener because I've never been disappointed with an Oxo product.  I should have switched years ago.  I couldn't believe how easy it opened cans, even ones that were dented on the top.  I have frozen shoulder and mild arthritis in my hands.  I can open cans pain free. I highly recommend this opener.	13
For under $4, every kitchen should have one of these veggie scrubbers!  It fits nicely in the palm of my hand, scrubs vegetables and cleans up easily with a toss into the dishwasher.After several uses, I've yet to see brush strands come loose - a problem I have had with previous veggie scrubbers.  I've used it on potatoes, yams, cucumbers and celery.  The brush bristles are strong enough to clean and soft enough not to scrape the veggie.I have no complaints.  I highly recommend this bargain vegetable brush.	13
I lost my trusty slide and really miss it. The Dunlop 220 feels heavier and looser on my little finger than my old timer but, it does sound sweet. If it was just a bit smaller diameter, that would do the trick. My old timer had enough corrosion inside to keep it secure so, a brand-new, sleek fit isn't a plus in my case. The Dunlop is well made, as expected. It's just not the Antiques Roadshow model I had in mind. Hmmm, might be a new product idea - rough up the inner surface and come up with a catchy name.	16
I have plenty of room on my fridge for storage. But not very much in cupboards and drawers. So some genius came up with the idea of sticking magnets on these babies, and they haven't gotten lost in our house since. I wish my walls were magnetic and more products could just be stuck on there for storage. Alright, that would look terrible, but these things are a great idea and they even look kind of nice and colorful decorating the fridge when they're not holding bags of chips closed.	13
I love you Teena..OH MY GOD!! This album is incredible..Although there are only 8 tracks, this music is timeless and any Teena Marie fan should have it..She starts off the album by making her listeners shake their thing on the dance floor but when you get to track #7, you realize why she is so loved..Her voice on Tune in Tomorrow..I cant even explain..She can hold a note till forever, and when she scats, you cant help but be in awe of her powerful voice..This woman has such a passionate voice that all I can say is, Get the album now!!!	9
There always comes along trend setters that some how cannot be bettered! Zelda is one of those games ,its challenging enjoyable adventurous fun!!!!!!!!!!! i loved every minute of it even though at times i wanted root out my hair i have no regrets having this game in my collection,one of the best games ever on 64.even though the 64 era has ended if you are a die hard gamer from time to time you may want to go back this game is definitely worth playing again and again there's always something you would have miss that you can find the next time around.	23
This a much better improvement than her debut which was good but not great like this one. The cd starts of coming alive and then soars with tracks like Talking in his sleep, Find me a man, Why should I care and I love me some him. After 8 years on the market this cd still has a refined sound to it as if debut yesturday . If you don't or never owned a Toni B album this is a very good one to start with. Also Try THE HEAT &amp; More up to date More Than A Woman.	9
I usually love all Avery products and I must say that I'm adding this product to my favorites as well.  These labels printed out well and I had no smearing when I applied them to my mailing envelopes.  Also, what I loved about them that it wasn't hard to peel and reposition them on the envelope once it caught.  The color blended nicely with my white evenlopes so well, that it appeared as if I printed the address on the envelope itself. I love these labels! From now on, I'll be buying these instead of the store brand I always buy.	17
Get your tissue ready, and be ready for intense feelings!  I read this book MANY years ago, before the hype and reread it again with my book club.  It was worth a second read, so to have this book as your own is worth it!  There is mystery, magic, and injustice.  The charcters are strongly built, and the scenery is vivid.  If you are looking for more books like this one...check out The Dirty Parts of the Bible.  You won't be disappointed either.	5
I got a power plug to power plug style &#34;jumper&#34; device for my daughter, in case the 12V battery on her Prius dies.  Since the Prius doesn't use the 12V battery to start the motor, she doesn't need real jumper cables.  However, it's a keyless ignition, so she will not be able to jump power plug to power plug.  The battery on the Prius is has small terminals, so these are a nice size and should do the job of getting power from someone else's light to her battery.	2
I bought the hd first and am completely in love with it. A very handy size and very responsive. Bought the hd+ for use when size is not a factor. Love both. Added 64 gig scandisk to both. Only real issue is that I run ubuntu, no windows/mac, so had to cobble my desktop and laptop to ba able to download to nook. Can set video downloads to default to sd card. Very happy. Thinking about buying one more of each if the price goes even lower, for backups in case of loss or damage.	10
This is my second WWII.  I prefer the full kerf version.  Now I can send back my other one for sharpening and not feel guilty.  Great cuts, nice and smooth in all types of wood.  My first one needs its first sharpening .. after quite a bit of cutting everyhing.  i did recently purchase a Freud rip blade for thicker rips of wood ... 2-3 inches worth.  This blade is not meant for thick rips of hardwood, but it suffices while sharp.  Great blade, definitely recommended.	21
"This is just a fun, creative toy.  It starts as a ball and comes apart into mini ""pyramid-like"" pieces.  From here, you can use your imagination and create new objects (animals, stars, etc.).  It also has a strangely soothing feel when you are putting it back together.The only drawback is that the magnets could be a little stronger.  Sometimes it is hard to get your new creations to stay together because they slip.  However, overall this is a really cool toy.  Good for kids and adults."	22
This is a great mat for the price. Enough cushion for floor exercise, easy to clean and carry. The one drawback is the fluffy nature of the foam. It isn't dense foam. So despite its thickness, it bottoms out pretty easily. making this a good mat for soft and slow moves, but wholly inadequate for anything that might involve impact. I used this for my prenatal yoga floor work and loved the cushy support for my aching hips and back. Overall, better than a typical extra thick yoga mat, but don't expect yoga mat density/quality.	20
For me there are a couple of things I consider when purchasing a stapler. First it needs to be a stapler that can handle the amount of work that I do daily and weekly. Secondly it should be condusive to my work environment. This swingline stapler accomplishes both.I like the fact that it's not easy to jam and that it is suited with the proper footing to stay put and not scuff your desk.A stapler is an important asset to your life in the office, and this one definitely takes care of the job well.	17
This is one of the only Godzilla movies of all time, and it was the best of the showa era. The music of the whole movie fits perfect,, this is my favorite godzilla theme! Second The movie has the best suit of the showa era. The story is great a greedy business man steals a giant egg, and the two girls from the movie mothra have come to warn that it will hatch and destroy japan. But soon godzilla raises from the grave and starts wrecking havoc. I feel godzilla could have had a little more destruction but this movie is perfect!	15
This is not a rub on, buff off product, like wax.  It takes a lot of rubbing against the scratch.It appears to be doing more harm than good, adding scratches to my fairly dark vehicle.  I'm using it by hand with a foam applicator, which never has scratched my finish when waxing.  I find the results of a good coat of wax do a better job and don't add additional swirlmark scratches like this stuff.  It may work better with a power buffer.  By hand, it's pretty useless.	2
Wonderful Transfers.  I don't think anyone doesn't know the plot of any of these movies, except maybe Twelve Chairs, so there's no need going there.  Great collection.  Well packaged.  Some have complained about the sleeves but Blu-Ray is supposed to be more scratch resistant isn't it?  Anyway transfer them to cases if you worry about it, but don't deny yourself the sound and glory of these madcap films in Blu-Ray.  The book is great.Just a wonderful tribute to the comedic genius that is Mel Brooks.  I highly recommend it.  Now will someone get Dracula: Dead and Loving It out in this format, please!	15
We got several of these before our overseas (by plane) trip.  They came in very handy for stacking the bags and luggage we had to manhandle through customs, airports, into taxis & B & Bs, etc.  They were very easy to use & sturdy, and I recommend every traveler carry a couple for unexpected needs (to bind more than one thing together for easy carrying).  I used one every day in the rental car to hang my bags on (hung it from the head rest) so items didn't get tossed and lost.	8
"I love playing SET.  It is challenging and fast-paced (well, once your brain is in the mode of spotting SETs).I've enjoyed this game with adults and adolescents.  In my experience, creative ""think outside the box"" type people enjoy it more than people with a more pragmatic perspective on life.It is not necessarily a good cross-generational type game (which I believe begs saying since it does not require reading one might think it'd be good for all ages to play together).Have fun, it's addictive."	22
"This is an excellent astringent, I had my doubts with products touting  ""oil eliminating"", ""oil free"" as they never seemed to work. This product does exactly what it's supposed to. The smell is similar to theNeutrogena Clear Pore Scruband it does not burn like some astringents do. I follow this with theNeutrogena Visibly Even Daily Moisturizer, SPF 30in the morning. I consider this product my ""holy grail"" in my skin care regimen. I kills the bacteria without killing my skin cells. It's an excellent product."	4
Whereas this device will allow you to adjust the volume, the range is limited from no sound to the volume you'd have without it.  I had gotten the [apparently mistaken] impression that it would boost the volume for headphones which had low volume for some sources (like Zune, IPod), but that does not appear to be the case.  Since you can always lower the volume on the source (mp3 player, etc.), I'm having a hard time seeing the value of this device - except that in some cases it might be handier to have an inline control.	10
Arguably the most depressing Christmas movie ever made....yet its realism and honesty only make it that much more powerful and heart-warming. The ending is worthy of many tissues, and it is not a typical manipulative  Christmas movie; this one earns its tears. Mary Steenburgen is excellent in  the lead role. Her speech to her children about their father is one of the  most powerful scenes Ms. Steenburgen has ever performed in. And who knew  Harry Dean Stanton could play an angel? A case of miscasting that worked  wonderfully.	15
"I didn't buy the scope for the case or the stand I was looking for a good mid-range spotting scope that is what my review is for. I shoot 100yds. with a marlin wmr 22 and I can see my shots on paper very good,I also shoot a Savage axis at 200 yds. and can still see my holes in targer, for someone that does bird watching or simular hobbies this is a very good scope for the price. I could read the lettering on a building that was at least 1200 yds. away 12"" letters."	20
ORIGINAL: These batteries have been excellent for my flashlight and work four about 2 hours on Full Power.  Not much else to say except that these are great money savers for high powered lights like mine.UPDATE 9/14/2013:  These batteries are still running as strong as they were when I purchased them, so I have increased my rating from 4 to 5 stars.  They work great in my work light, Fenix TK35, which is a highly demanding power consuming unit.  I completely recommend these for anyone who is a LEO, EMS or similar line of work.	10
Paul McCartney himself credits Brian Wilson's Pet Sounds as the muze for  Sgt. Pepper's.  Listen critically to the tracks and echos of Pepper  resonate, from the melodious use of bass guitar to the masterful  orchestration of these odes to teenage angst.Is Pet Sounds better than  Pepper?  Beside the point.  But without Pet Sounds, and the competition  Brian Wilson represented to the fab four, you may very well have a  different Pepper, or perhaps no Pepper at all.You haven't heard genius  until you've heard Pet Sounds.  It is an album for the ages.	9
The dreamcast is dead, no more consoles from sega, great games lost? Not neccasirly you can get them on the gamecube too. However I was hear to write a review.This game is fast action, and exploration, and questing. There are missions you have to unlock and sub missions you must complete plus you can switch between characters. And each characters levels differ, like tails racing sonic or knuckles finding shards, this was quite possibly the best platformer ever made. It puts mario to shame and I hope the known world undesrtands this!	23
I thouhgt about buying the one touch can opener till I read the reviews.  This had good reviews and I still liked a manual can opener.  This one is great.  It turns very easily and thats what I was looking for.  The only upgrade it could have had would have been a magnet to hold the lid of the can, instead it leaves a tiny bit of the lid attached so it doesn't fall into the food.  So I guess it's 4 ++ and to me that equals a 5.	13
I should have stayed with Idahoan brand. Poor Betty is on her last legs, rolling downhill into oblivion!I've used several brands of potato flakes and found them very good. But not Betty's brand. The finished product tastes stale. Bland, unpleasant, not worth continuing eating---but the worst part is STALE.  I am totally ashamed of Amazon for offrering these packets. My advice to any customer looking for good mashed potato flakes: Move on to Idahoan or another brand and leave poor Betty by the wayside.Where these packets should have been left. Alone. Ignored. Skipped over. By the way, I didn't like them!	11
I own a lot of guitars and have to change strings often enough, I don't really enjoy changing strings but it needs done, this tool makes it such a breeze I don't know how I ever went without it. It takes me a fraction of the time it used to take changing strings, I can have them all loosened and cut in seconds where before I would stand there cranking one tuning peg for what seemed like forever. I am really happy with this purchase and will check out more stuff from Planet Waves.	16
I absolutely love my Palm IIIx.  Originally, my wife ordered a Handspring Visor for my birthday.  Six weeks later, with no indication of when (if ever) the Visor would be shipping, she cancelled it and ordered the Palm  IIIx for me instead.  I've been playing endless with it since.I find,  for example, it's easier to write on the PDA than on paper in a moving car;  hence, car rides can be much more productive.Then I found out about  downloading games from the Internet.  I've been wasting endless amounts of  time playing a beloved game from my college days (&quot;Rogue&quot;).	10
I would give it 5 stars if it wasn't an oily topical that you have to avoid touching for 2 days until fully absorbed.  I know the flea protection works and can only hope that the tick protection works, too.  I like that it's supposed to repel ticks and lice.There is a new one out called NEXGARD that is oral, but I'm reluctant to try it since it currently only lists one tick type and isn't a repellant, so the tick has to bite the dog before it kills it.	19
I agree with all the positive reviews about these amazing stereophones. They sound phenomenal for the price. The only negative is the weakness of the cords. After a year or two of normal use, one side or the other may break its connection and there's no way you can fix it yourself (many tiny strands to solder). I have returned mine twice to Koss (great lifetime warranty) and they have replaced them for a small $6 shipping charge. It takes about 3-4 weeks. That's my only complaint.	10
After receiving a gift of delicious blueberry preserves from a speciality store, I set out to find something similar in my local supermarket; in particular, I was looking for a product made from wild blueberries.  Bonne Maman's Wild Blueberry Perserves turned out to be exactly what I wanted!  It's a very sweet jam that includes whole wild blueberries (which are smaller than regular blueberries) in every spoonful.  The preserves are easily spreadable and are great on toast, but I've also found that they are wonderful for adding to plain yogurt or smoothies.  A delicious must-have for blueberry lovers!	11
These are pretty much your average file folder, although the expansion feature is nice.  The reinforced tab means they are somewhat more sturdy with respect to the tab folding over, but not much---enough use and pressure will cause these tabs to fold, as well.  But what difference does it make, the tabs can always be righted again!  I would not find this folder worth a premium price (and I prefer the five-tab vs three-tab variety).  The reinforced tab also makes it difficult to turn the folder inside-out for reuse, which I commonly do as a cost-saving and recycling measure.	17
Bought this because of all the great reviews, ButThis doesn't work, just like the last Beringer product I bought. Will I ever learn? Very disappointing.UPDATE- Now working; got my mate an Aussie genius to have a look.Found pedal wasn't engaging when pushed down.Took plastic cover off and pressed black button with his pinky and light came on; sheer genius.Worked fine with cover off; then replaced cover with new bit of rubber. And it still works.Amazing sound actuallyStill not sold on Berhinger though	16
MacLean delivers another fun adventure in this 1983 yarn about a World War II espionage mission.  Pete Peterson and his motley crew of maybe-Chetniks maybe-Partisans cross Italy and Yugoslavia to deliver a message and unmask  a double agent.  The characters are MacLean classics:  beautiful patrician  women, evil assassins, stalwart companions, and a glib and brilliant hero.  The plot meanders through the confusion of Yugoslavia's three-way civil war  while under Italian and German occupation.  A fun adventure, a light read,  a real Alistair MacLean classic.	5
"What a WONDERFUL book about a slice of American life that not many people know about.  What was circus life like during the Depression? Don't let the topic discourage you from reading this book.  I was captured by the first line: ""I am ninety. Or ninety-three. One or the other.""  As I was reading this book, I could see the whole story play out in my mind as the author easily transitioned the storyteller from the present day back to the 1930's and his life on a circus train.  I can't say enough good things about this book.  Read it....It's a true winner!!!"	5
I agree with the other reviewers who state the unit is ugly.  the welds are bulky and uneven.  However, the welds seem stout and I am sure it will perform just fine.  After all, this is about as low-tech as you can get.  I will disagree with other reviewers who say the unit does not move/sway.  I have a 5/8&#34; pin in it and my bike rack moves pretty substantially.  I will be getting an adapter to remedy this problem.  Bottom line for me for this product was price.  I am overall pleased with Curt and this product.	2
"If you relish a series like ""Honey West,"" ""T.H.E. Cat"" or ""77 Sunset Strip"" you no doubt know about the content of what you are getting. You are more likely concerned about the quality of the product. Like John Steed (Patrick Macnee) might say to Mrs. Emma Peel (Diana Rigg), ""You scratch my back and I'll scratch your back. Just watch the hat please."" John and Emma are back and are here to stay via DVD technology. Being on DVD, the aesthetics about the actual episodes are not in question here. More appropriately one may ask how they look. They look good, very good."	15
The biggest problem I had with this work was switching the names of the firms owners. In 3 circumstances she switched the name of the bad partner with the good.  How irritating.  How did this get by for 13 years.  Yes, the piece was originally released in '99 and no one caught it?  Really?  AND I agree with the other reviewer that noted how sophomoric this story was.  Maybe the point taken should have been her age. Maybe she should have been younger than 27. Anyhow, there are far better stories in this story feed than this one.	14
This movie is what I would call a timeless Christmas classic now. The best thing is, you can watch it anytime. It doesn't always have to be around Christmas. If you're in the mood for a bundle of laughs, watch it whenever you want. The first one is classic and probably the best. The second is almost just as good, but it doesn't disappoint. I prefer the first 2. Anything beyond that kills the movie. 1 and 2 are all you need. This Blu-Ray double feature provides just that for a decent price. I love it.	15
I hope you're not looking for a multi-thousand-word review on this one.  :-)  It's tape, after all.  But this brand has worked well on everything I've thrown at it.  It sticks wrapping paper well, essentially disappearing into the paper once stuck.  But it also sticks stuff to walls well, and in my experience doesn't bring up the paint or leave behind a stick residue when you pull it off.  Good produce that does EXACTLY what it's meant to do!	17
Starsiege Tribes is (by a Hiroshima) the best game on our planet. There is so much, I repeat, SO MUCH to do in the tribes universe. One problem with the game that is a problem but once you play you'll forget: NO single player. The multiplayer is SO good that this game should be called BUBBA and Halo and all those other[...] games should be renamed BUBBA'S[...]. For $10 or less, you cannot beat this. Get it. Absorb it. Die a happy gamer. You will not regret it my friends.	23
I ADORE this leave-in conditioner! It smells nice, it works great, and it doesn't leave a nasty feeling residue in my hair! I have very curly hair, and live in a humid climate. This stuff was GREAT for humid days. I use it EVERY day after showering, before I put in any other products, and it helps keep my hair from damage due to styling products. If I use just the conditioner, it leaves my hair soft and less frizzy. It's WONDERFUL stuff, and Amazon has a GREAT price!	4
"The Ghost of Guns N' Roses lives in this album if you listen carefully, in some cases Myles "" The Dying Cat"" tries to emulate Axl's style.Take a good listen and you'll find ""Locomotive"" riff from Use Your Illusion in ""Standing in the Sun"", ""Anything Goes"" from Appetite in ""Halo"" the chorus has some of Axl's style from ""Outta Get Me"", ""Move to The City"" is in ""Hard & Fast"" and the Chorus is very similar to ""Been There Lately"" From Slash's SnakepitGood album but sorry I cannot stand the annoying whining nasal singing from Myles..."	6
I've read other books by this author that are much better than this poorly executed story. It isn't as long as you would think. It started at 2% and ended at 88%. An abrupt ending without really answering some points brought up in the book. A lot of promise with no follow through is what this book amounted to for me. I would not recommend this book to a friend. I say go spend your money on one of the many other wonderful m/m stories available. It moved way too quickly to even make sense. I love you in less than 24 hours, really?	14
Excellent product.  Does exactly as it's supposed to.  Just don't be a moron like I was and pay attention to the direction of the arrows and think about how the water will get sucked from the bottle.  I had mine connected backwards for about 30 minutes until I figured out why it was not sucking anything from the anti-freeze bottle.  Once I corrected my mistake, it worked like a charm.  Definitely a must-have for any rv'er especially one that lives in the north.	2
This is the only sun screen moisturizer that I can find that features the physical combination of zinc oxide and titanium dioxide to provide true broad spectrum UVA/UVB protection without potentially harmful chemicals with adverse effects (like oxybenzone and octinoxate, which interfere with reproductive hormones and metabolism). Unlike chemical agents, physical agents are not susceptible to being absorbed into the skin after they are broken down by the sun. The product initially has a white tint, as if it doesn't have very good consistency, but this fades away within several minutes.	4
I'm not a great fun of Microsoft but I have to admit that they did a great job with this joystick, just for once. I bought the Saitek Cyborg 3D. Same price. It was horrible. Unstable. It was cool looking but what's the use a  cool joystick when you can't land your plane with it because it sends  random signals to your pc? Sidewinder is precise and reliable.  Also it's  multipurpose. I use it for Falcon 4 and Need for Speed and it's great with  both.	23
"I've bought three of these now - this is an awesome, well made case that fits just about any superstrat guitar easily. The most recent was for something rather unique (a fanned fret, compound scale eight string) and that guitar also fit perfectly with plenty of room to spare.There are more expensive options out there, but for a non-fitted ""do it all"" case, this is the best bang for your buck hands down. I am comfortable using it to carry any of my guitars, from the inexpensive ones to the high end customs. Great case, great price."	16
These tights are extremely soft and very flattering. They fit perfectly and looked very sleek and of high quality. The only thing is, I purchased the barely there color and it is a little darker than the picture. In fact, it is more of a tan color and would go perfectly with people who have a tan complexion like I do. You really can't tell I'm wearing tights until you come closer and even then, it is such a nice, sophisticated look. These tights would go great with formal evening wear and dresses.	8
Some of the other reviewers here prefer the aerosol, but I think the squeeze bottle is just fine for re-oiling a cleaned filter.  I don't know what everyone is complaining about.  This is something that's good to do while you have some yardwork or some reason to be outside since the filter needs to sit for about 15-20 minutes during the cleaning/oiling process.In the long run, if you keep your car long enough, one K&N; filter is cheaper than all of those disposables.	2
This app does a good job in locating the wi-fi around you - which helped me determine that the $100+ I was paying monthly for my wifi and my phone was not worth it.  I could get the same number of bars with a much less expensive internet company.  I tried it at my friend's house who had the inexpensive package & the bars were the same.  I encourage everyone to try this experiment for themselves.  The app is free, so what could it hurt.	1
I've been using this headphone for a few months.For the build - It looked filmsy, but even I haven't been using it very carefully, it's still working well, no parts broken.For the sound quality, the bass is very good, mid-range is good. I hope the high range could be a bit clearer.  Meanwhile, I found that this headphone is quite musical, no harsh high range, and enjoyable to listen to, especially for piano music, easy listening, and jazz music.  Still the high range could be a bit improved; but, at this price range, it's very okay.	10
I bought a Nick Drake album once before &amp; was really disappointed by the arrangements.  Lots of strings... couldn't really listen to it.  Then I picked up Pink Moon.  WOW!  This is what all the fuss is about.  Unique, acoustic, mellow &amp; beautiful.  If you are at all interested in Nick Drake get Pink Moon first &amp; you'll be hooked.  This is a great album &amp; I've got to admit that it was that VW add that made me give Nick Drake another shot... really a mellow classic.	9
I bought the Smile to have a handy, inexpensive way of addingphtos to web pages. I didn't want to spend $400 on a camera that wouldbe obsolete in a few months. I figured for $100 I couldn't go wrong. I was mistaken.The Smile just has too many compromises. The lens is a tiny fixed-focus item that requires bright light to form an image. Battery life is abysmal- it seems to chew up a pair of AAs shooting a dozen pictures. I should have spent $200 and gotten a far better camera.	10
I have two of these speedloaders, both for .38 revolvers. One is a 5 shot and the other, a 6 shot. The loaders themselves are fine and certainly of high quality for the price. However, both of them snag on the grips and have to be wrestled into position. It is also a bit awkward to unlock the rounds when they are in the chambers. I have recommended these loaders to my friends but insist that they use them on their own firearms to see if they encounter the same problems that I have.	20
Being primarily raw, we finally see a healthy raw food bar on the market. Well,  it's been out a few years, but I'm just reviewing it now. :)This bar tastes pretty good.  The texture is a little weird, but I can look past it, for the nutritional benefits, and the taste really isn't all too bad.  It doesn't taste like a snickers bar, but it's also not rock-hard and crunchy, like many other raw food bars.All in all, good bar.  I recommend them to any health conscious athlete.	11
I was finally convinced that I need a pressure cooker for meat due to my work hours. I looked everywhere for the smallest size, they were either unavailable or too expensive. Reviews here showed great product so I bought it. I used it the very first day and I couldn't be more satisfied. Meat cooked in 12 minutes vs 30-45 minutes. I gave it four stars only because the color changes after washing it but that doesn't affect the cooking. It comes with directions which explained how long each food takes to cook.	13
PROS: Good audio, easy to program, good features.CONS:However, the FCC will require broadcasters to switch to a digital format in February 2009.  At that time, the radio WILL NO LONGERr receive televison broadcast audio.  Therefore, a good percentage of the radio's value is gone!Nationwide, the FCC has reserved 10 weather channel frequencies available.  Usually all 10 can't be received.  This radio only has 5 channels for weather.  In my case, none of those 5 channels contains any weather signals.	10
I curl my hair pretty frequently, I'm a fan of Old Hollywood style and have been on the lookout for a good pair of rollers for ages. I was hesitant to get Conair ones because most of my other cheaper hair supplies have been disappointing, but I read some good reviews and decided to go for it.So glad I did! These rollers are great, they get super hot and retain heat for forever. I have really thick heavy hair, but letting these rollers cool while in my hair ensures I have bouncy awesome curls for DAYS. Love them!	4
I borrowed this item from a friend when I had my first child.  I loved it!  It stores a stack of diapers, a case of wipes, diaper cream, lotion, etc.- all within reach.  What I liked best was when friends and family came over to help out with the baby, they could clearly see where everything was to change baby's diaper.  Also, the plastic is clear, unlike a fabric diaper stacker, so you can clearly so how many diapers you have handy.Loved this item, will probably buy it for myself now that I'm pregnant once again!	3
I use this in a Keurig coffee maker, using the adaptor cup.  It works fine, and the coffee is good.  Although the Keurig is nice and convenient, it is not the cheapest way to get a cup of coffee.  Using these pods cuts the cost about in half.I like this dark roast and will continue to buy it.  The taste of coffee, like the taste of anything else, is a personal preference.  I like it, but you might hate it.  The pods, though, are reasonably-priced and work well with my Keurig.	11
Maybe this is all part of THE JOKE; to get people caught up in the reemergence of Kaufman fame and then to purchase a totally CRUMMY product. HAHAHAHA! I bet Bob Zmuda (Andy's best friend) was a behind this. HAHAHAHA!  Just reading the reviews got me to laugh. Part of Andy's act was bombing on  purpose. Go back and watch this again or compare the part in the movie when  Kaufman wanted the ABC special to look as if it was messing up. (MAN are  some people gullible...)	15
If you have rose bushes, the Fiskars Pruner is a must have. I love fresh roses in the house but hate those pesky thorns and always had a heck of a time removing them. With the Fiskars Pruner, I was able to remove all thorns rather quickly (it only took one or two times to get it down) and found the pruners to fit really well in my hand, eliminating any hand discomfort.  The blade is sharp and shows no sign of rust after using them for a season. This is a really useful tool and I absolutely would recommend others to purchase!	18
These are perfect clamps for just about any purpose.  I use them to secure things to my work bench prior to drilling, sawing and sanding.  Many other uses. So easy to use, and very well designed.  One of the most useful things to have around your shop. And a great price.  One thing to be careful about: make sure you are careful as you use them or you can pinch the palm of your hand pretty badly between the trigger and the grip.  I found this out the hard way!	21
This iPhone made cord will work with ANY standard 3.5mm jack.  This means not only will it work with your iPhone, but will also with your Touch, Nano, Classic and what not.  This means this cord will work with any of the current audio devices you have that have a standard 3.5mm jack.  The only difference between the input jack on the iPhone and any other MP3 player is that the iPhone jack is deeper, more recessed in than normal.  Cord is well constructed and very sturdy.  I use it in my Camry and the sound is excellent.	7
My Grandmother got this tub for my 3 month old son to use while visiting. It isn't as spacious as the tub we use at home, which is a little smaller than most tubs, but it folds up nicely, and it feels very safe and sturdy-not flimsy at all. I use both tubs in the big bathtub, so leaking isn't a problem for me. My son seems comfortable, but he prefers to have more water to splash in than this one holds. This tub is great for grandma's house, or if space is tight.	3
I love the features and so far so good.  I am concerned about one of the other reviews that states it won't work in cold weather.  Being a tool for a contractor there is no excuse for it not working in all types of weather.  I am also not sure how it will hold up. Not that it looks cheap, but I can;t say it looks bulletproof either.  In our business I need bulletproof, so a more expensive tougher unit may have been a better choice for us.  I'll update later after a few months of use.	21
My dog loves these treats, I typically try to give one a day but with all the other treats she get's often a day or two is missed.  No worry as long as you supplement the desired ingredients for hip/joint in other products or food.  The treats are soft and good for dog's of all ages, no choking worries.  The nice thing about Zukes is the ingredients list is not a mile long and they don't use meat by-products and you also don't see a lot of strange ingredients that are common in the mass marketed products.	19
I dip the front of it in kerosene and run it through the barrel (always in the direction of the bullet/shot) and it leaves the bore with a mirrior finish. Shotgun brushes, rods, and patches are oversized and rather slow to change, like any rod kit.Being a boresnake, it works a hundred times better than patches since there is so much more contact with the bore. I wouldn't pack this into a field cleaning kit though, it's huge.Snags easier on parts inside the receiver than rifle boresnakes, especially a Saiga 12.Would recommend to anyone active with shotguns.	20
Ugh. I had always just had the default interface and felt it was fine, but my brother does a lot of customizing with his myTouch 4G, so I thought, &quot;Eh, why not try it out?&quot; Never again will I try to change the home layout. This app is so clunky! I hated every interaction I had with it, and I can't believe anybody would pay $3 for this piece of crap.Do yourself a favor and leave this one alone. Terrible, terrible, terrible.	1
This camera definitely works for what I need it for - taking pictures to use on my Web site, The Schumin Web, and saving the remainder as stock photos.  The floppy disk storage allows for you to take literally thousands of pictures without going back to your computer, and thus gets high marks for portability.  All in all, a great camera, and if you're like me, whenever you take it with you, carry some floppies in your pocket, because you will be taking a lot of pictures.	10
"At first I was skeptical that a business card printed on an inkjet printer would look ""professional"" - but I was pleasantly surprised to find that, in fact, I can't tell the difference between a print-shop business card and the ones that I made at home.  The clean cut edge is very smooth.  To make things easy just feed the paper one at a time and put the printer on the thick-paper setting, and then fold the edges of the cards toward you when separating them."	17
I would have preferred a little more back story on the main characters earlier in the book, but the back stories were set out later. I would have preferred a little more depth but I also understand that he is writing many more books with the same characters so I understand not fleshing everything out in the first book. I will DEFINITELY be purchasing more of this author's works but have to take it slow on disability income. Otherwise I would purchase the writers entire inventory from Amazon kindle store. Five stars all the way !!!!	14
There are better bagged green teas than this (try Yogi's many varieties or my favorite, Taylors of Harrogate Green Tea with Jasmine) but this isn't bad for what it is. The tea's a little weak and I usually have to use 2 bags to make a decent cup but it's okay for someone just dabbling into the world of green tea for the first time. It also makes a good iced tea by itself or with a little agave nectar. I'd recommend buying this if you're just starting out with green tea and you're not sure what you like.	11
The new gardening season comes early to Texas. I recently bought this set and have been entirely pleased. They have a number of postive points to them. First they are made out of quality material that you can see and feel right away. Second they have, for me, the perfect combination of not being too heavy but also sturdy. Third the handles really are comfortable. For your flower/ vegetable planting and close maintenance this set is top of the line. I have seen many, many inferior tools for three times the price at big box stores. Highly recommended.	18
I saw mixed reviews and bought anyway.  I should have just both two of them right off the bat.  Bought the one, put it on, and it looks fine.  If I run into problems with the springs, I think there are lots of things I can do to bind it to the step.  Fits my RV step just fine.  Now I will order the second one.  If the springs hold up, that will be great because it is good to be able to take it off easily to wash the rug.	2
I started using these little scrubbers some 20 years ago.  I still use them.  I have had to use store brand imitations for a number of years however because they are so impossible to find.  Then about six months ago, I finally saw one in my local store.  I couldn't believe the difference!  Still as powerful in cleaning but not as harshly abrasive.  I get compliments on my skin all the time. I always tell people that its because of Buf-Puf.It doesn't matter what your age... It is never to late to start exfoliating!	4
I have had a Mantis tiller since1990 and it was time to get a new one.  The old one did not have a way to pump the fuel into the carborator and this one does.  The main problem with this tiller is keeping the dirt out of the carborator.  Every time you use this tiller I would remove the air filter and clean it and around the carborator.  I use it in rocky soil and rocks do bind up the blades but you can easily remove the rocks.  It will dig right through weeds and will dig deep to make a garden.	18
This game is a ton of fun with a group of kids. Gameplay is a little long (1/2 an hour or more for a single game), so it isn't one that you can squeeze in quick before doing something else. If just adults are playing, it may not be as big of a hit, as it is a very simple game.I agree with those who have said it is similar to Skipbo, but slightly more fun. If you have Skipbo already, this one would probably be redundant.	22
PROS: Easy game to learn, Educational for US. Geography, Moderate luck factor.CONS: Not recommended for avid game players. Only moderate strategy.Ticket to ride is fun, it's got some strategy to it, but I've played better. In fact, the European version adds a few more variants that greatly improve on the game. I would recommend this game for beginners. For highly competitive game board fanatics, one or two plays of this version and you'll move on. Best just to skip to the European version.	22

This mario kart changed all mario karts in the future. This is the first mario kart that has mini games and computer generated graphics. I mean the 64 as u can tell the graphics have changed allot from the snes. This mario kart has many more features and great graphics. The sound is great also. If i had a choice of which mario kart to have for free if i did not have any of them it would be this one. I dont know why but for some reason this one is really fun. It has a great multiplayer, especially on mini games.	23
Though I have not really seen very many full episodes of this program before, the ones that I have seen have bored me out of my mind. The plots are awfully dull, even though I do enjoy the music a lot of times. The performers are fantastic at singing and I enjoy many of the songs that they have covered, but the plots of the episodes are awfully bland to me. Other people might think differently, but that is just my opinion. I like the singing; just not the series itself.	0
Sephiroth, the main villian of the game, is probably the best-dressed villian in a FF game.  Also, he has the most sinister theme of any villian in any game.  Everything about Sephiroth is sinister.You play Cloud, a man from the small city of Nibelheim (sounds like a city in Germany). Cloud works for AVALANCHE, a terrorist group that's fighting against the evil Shirna, Inc.  As the game unfolds, you learn that Shirna, Inc does far more evil than AVALANCHE does.  Shirna, Inc knows no end to its evil.One of the best games for the ps1!	23
My friends and I got this when it first came out so long ago in like 99 or something like that.  Might have been earlier too.  Anyways, I played it through myself on Leon first and the game had an amazing storyline and the RPG part of the game is amazing.  There are a few challenging mini puzzles which can be very annoying, much like Zelda, but once you get past them all is well again.  I would highly recommened this game to anyone, and compared to the gore they have in nowadays games, this is nothing.	23
I have read almost all of Ms. James books. This is by far my favorite. Anyone that has been married for a length of time can relate. Saying what you think and feel is not always easy. Also wanting or needing it is easy to become so focused you alienate the other person. She did such a brilliant job of showing that. It is so clear that they love each other you can't help but root for them.  It will bring a tear to your eye but in the end you smile because meant to be is sometimes enough.	14
I don't usually buy short stories but this one sounded like something I would enjoy so I broke my own impulse-buying rule and downloaded it to my Kindle. Though it is very well written, I am not sold to buy short reads in the future. This writer does have talent for the macabre though so if you are looking for a quickie ghost story, this one might please you. I gave it 4 stars because in the end I was a little disappointed with the premise on which the story was built.	14
This is my second 4 way switch and it won't be the last. The four way gives you an added combination of neck and bridge in series, which gives a fatter tone than position 2 and more output than positions 1,2,or 3. I am very pleased with the &#34;new sound&#34; of my tele. The wiring diagram is very easy to understand and the install is pretty easy if you have a soldering gun. (don't forget to lay down some newspaper to protect your guitar finish from solder).	16
I've been eating Knorr (Lipton) noodles for about 15 years now. They are simple to make, inexpensive, and tasty. This particular variety is rather lacking in the flavor department. As far as all the Knorr varieties go, this is near the bottom of my list. I will probably not be buying this one again. This flavor, along with the other two new flavors (Bacon Cheddar and Scampi) are rather disappointing. I would have expected more from Knorr. The discontinued Beef Lo Mein Asian side from Knorr was much, much better than this.	11
I'm really disappointed in this.  We got it for our son and after one adult driven test drive to see how the controls worked (with no major crashes...a few wall bumps and one ceiling touch, by far nothing hard enough to visibly damage it) and it would not lift off again after that.  No visible damage, no gears stripped, full charge...all it would do after the first 2 minute flight was spin on the ground.  It's repackaged and on it's way back to Amazon as I type.  Save your money.	22
I would like the volume wheel to be bigger or stick out more, so it would be easier to use. The plug is straight, not L shaped as shown in the current picture. The cord is 36 inches. I use this with my MP3 player because I'm trying to minimize wear and tear on my old player and I don't like my panasonic headphone volume control slider thing. I didn't want the thin metal pocket/belt clip, but fortunately I was able to pull it off with some thin pliers.	10
I used to see Clubman at the drugstore (in glass bottles) but at the time I was an Old Spice and Aramis guy. Bought a bottle of this on a lark to get an order up over the $35 mark and tried it the next weekend (weekends are when I'm alone and if it bombs I don't have to suffer all day with it).After the alcohol flashed off and the essence warmed on my skin the most pleasant aroma filled the room, but not overpowering. And you won't smell like the boys in gym class with their Bod and Axe.	12
I used this for a couple months and ended up buying another product because of a couple issues with this one.- The bowls come with a sticker on them holding them in place. It's impossible to get it off without leaving some residue so you end up with a dirty spot in each bowl and one side of the holder has a big sticky area on it.- If the water is in the bowl for more than a day it gets a chemical smell/taste to it which I can't imagine is good for my pets- It's not attractive looking	19
Pro's: Easy to setup.  Supports many different VESA formats. Has some articulation.  Sturdy construction.  Can be installed by one person w/o too much effort.Con's: Cable guides fall off easily.  The joints are a bit too stiff; you really have to man-handle it to get it fully extended, and you have to push fairly hard to get it to compact again.  So far I have not noticed any wear from this firm pulling/pushing, but I worry because it is only attached to the studs buy 2 bolts.	10
Our 11 month old male English bull terrier loves this toy, and our female of the same breed loves to play with the toy and chase with the toy.  The toy is very rugged, yet soft enough to interest them.  So far neither of them have chewed any pieces off of this toy.  We have used the tougher black rubber Kong bell shaped toys also.  These red rubber ones are a bit softer and easier for them to play with if you can keep them from destroying the red rubber toys.  So far so good with ours.	19
The relief from pain in my feet and in my lower back comes after a few minutes of applying. It does has a medicine smell, but is not near as strong of a smell as most sports creams and ice/heat rubs. The 4 oz. bottle of Absorbine will last you a long time even with daily use. The defect I find is in the foam applicator, which causes too much to come out and run. I have to be careful when applying to my lower back or it easily can run down my buttcrack, which feels like hot lava.	12
This album is only a few days old, i dont think thats enough time to understand the 'whole thing, so people giving it a five like me arent being very honest at the moment, i think we all know its potential and complexity that it will lead to a 5.  But i will be honest and give it a 3.5 right now, but i will give it a 5 because i dont feel like coming back and changing this review to a 5 in a few months.  I did that with Vapor Trails.	6
These are a good price/value for moderate use.  The dividers are not very thick but they do have reinforced holes. They have the standard write on/ slip in labels.I have bought these for my kids and find they do not stand up to high school use (shoving in and out of backpacks).  My kids also like there to be a pocket on the dividers so I have been getting them the Avery Big Tab Plastic Dividers which cost only a tiny bit more.  I use these myself and they are fine, but I am a little more careful with my folders.	17
Although in game terms this is more or less a carbon copy of the playstation version, the nintendo one is less blocky and the graphics shine through.  The game is set over various trcaks where you have 5 tapes to do.  Completing a task earns you a tape.  Tasks range from finding hidden tapes, earning high scorers and finding five letters to spell out skate.  The two player mode on this game is excellant the longativity is imense, this is one game you wont be able to put down	23
I accidentally read the second book in this series first and I have to say that I liked it better.  There was more to it.  The author really has talent when she takes the time to expand.  One thing that I found oddly creepy and curious was that Devlin is a name I have used for gaming avatars and as a pseudonymn before and Laine is totally the type of guy I dig.  J.L., have you been reading my journal?  LOL...  Really though these books helps to melt my icy heart and believe in romance again.	14
I started playing backgammon in college nearly 40 years ago. In fact, I got pretty good; winning several championship tournaments. But, that, was a long time ago. I didn't remember how to play until I got this program for my kindle fire. I like it because it comes with different levels of play as well as instructions! I am now working my way up the levels and have begun sparring with the game's computer. I'm not ready for tournaments at the local assisted-living facility, yet!  But soon!!!!	1
I just recently bought my fourth WEP200.  This is a great headset.  Everyone I've bought it for loves its.  Its small, discrete and stays in  your ear.  Takes a bit to figure out how to put it in your ear.  But once it is in, it stays in.  Very easy to connect with my phones: LGVX9700, LGVX9400, Samsung SCH-a950, Samsung U550, LGVX8500.  Great buy.  Should have bought more than 1 when it was 4.99 after 20 mir.	7
I have been a subscriber to Zillow's web site for almost 2 years. This application does much more than what I was ever able to do on my phone. I have had great success in saving my searches for specific properties as well as searching for specific locations. This is a tool that I would rate as a must have for someone wanting to relocate, research, or invest in property. I would strongly recommend this application! I have not once been disappointed in my research using the Zillow app on my Kindle Fire.	1
My spinner finally gave out and no one makes it anymore. I prefer the string pull as i feel it gets the water out faster and better but this is a close second. This spinner is really nice! I got the smaller one and it is a perfect size! Thick plastic and the spinner push works great. It really does get all the water out. The push stopper works great but i feel it has a time limit as to how long it will last but lets see. I really love it.	13
I bought this a couple weeks ago to use to scrub up some stains out of our carpet and it has worked wonderfully. And while the bristles are delicate enough to not destroy a carpet, they are also robust enough to use to scrub a shower, sink or tub - I've used it for all of these. This is a bit more expensive than other bargain scrub brushes you might find, but the ergonomic grip really is worth it. If you are going to be using this for any extended period of time, your hands and wrist will feel the difference.	12
"And yet...unlike anything I've ever heard before.  While this may be the antithesis of easy listening, somehow it seems there's a master to all this rage and noise.  While I wouldn't call this party music or listen to this every day, it's easy to see that Surfer Rosa by the Pixies would not exist with this album and Atomizer (Especially ""Something Against You"", which after hearing the two albums almost seems like a Big Black impersonation).  And for that influence alone, I have to admit this ""music"" (I have to use the word loosely here) isn't half bad."	9
I bought these to power my wife's first high output LED flashlight. They did work, but did't last nearly as long as I'd expected. The charger worked fine and we had no real issues with the batteries, we just weren't impressed.I ended up replacing each pair with a single Panasonic 3100 mA 18650 battery and have been much happier. We ended up giving these away, along with the flashlight to my step-daughter when we upgraded the wife's flashlight to something with a little more punch.	10
I'm getting exactly the performance from this tool as I expected. If you want a compact unit, this will do. If you need something with larger capacity, better get something bigger. Speed adjustment is very easy. The chuck is a bit sticky and I broke teeth off the chuck key right away. Maybe it was my fault, but I've used drill presses for years and never had this happen. I started using the other side of the key after this happened, and SNAP! it happened again. I'll get a quality key. BE CAREFUL!	21
If you like serial killer novels then there will be nothing earth shattering here.  Certainly don't download it if you don't like serial killer novels because it will likely traumatize you.While the gruesomeness is clearly entertaining to the authors (and okay, to the readers too, otherwise we wouldn't read this stuff) it was not terribly frightening.  I like the books where I'm looking under the bed for a week after reading.There was certainly nothing imaginative enough here that made me want to go out and buy books by either of the authors.I have to say the concept, especially the third chapter, was neat.	14
For some reason, I had never watched Upstairs Downstairs, thinking it was one of the British zany, silly comedies.  However, my husband and I decided to give it a try and enjoyed it very much.  It is definitely not a zany silly comedy.  We will be watching all the available episodes.  Sometimes I find myself comparing it to Downton Abbey, but the two shows are decidedly different.  Maybe I just fell in love with Downton early on, but Upstairs Downstairs is quite enjoyable and I would highly recommend watching it.	15
These nipples worked great at first but about 2 weeks before we were to switch to the next size my grandson started to collapse them and he got a blister on his top lip from sucking so vigorous. When we finally did switch him (at the proper time) to the next nipple he kinda gagged as he wasn't used to getting so much milk / formula.  But we are still using these nipples just might switch him sooner if he starts to collapse the size he is in so he won't have to suck so hard or get another blister.	3
...this one's just &#34;okay.&#34;  It's basically more of a glorified wallet.  It has a lot of organization in it, but it's so small that you can't do much.  In one side pocket I have a little Vera Bradley journal.  In the other side pocket a tiny credit card wallet and lipstick.  The main compartment is big enough for my Epi-Pen, a pill case, my cell phone, and one Baggu, and that's it.  I've ordered a Le Sportsac Frame Bag and that will replace this as soon as it arrives.	8
I can not understand why there people who DO NOT read.This product should NOT be used as a water conditioner, NOT your function .. and by the way many people do NOT follow instructions.this product contains beneficial bacteria that HELP the filtering process BIOLOGICAL aquarium. I have an aquarium of 430 liters MARINO. and used it for 02 years .. works very well is excellent and if clear .. maintains a clear water, the fish are happy. the corals are doing well.I have no complaints of the product. works very well	19
The stand is very well constructed and very stable.  The other stands that I have used were all bottom holders.  I was a little concern using a stand with a neck holder, but then again..all guitar stores display their guitars with them...so I thought ... lets have a go,  I'm glad I did.  My stand doesn't tip over like the others.  You just have to lift up before you take your instrument out.  The fingers in front hold the instrument in... lifting up slightly will disengage the fingers so you can remove your instrument.	16
My dog loves this! I squirt in in or on her toys when she's done something to deserve at treat. She wiggles her whole body when she sees the can. It's easy to use, and the &#34;wand&#34; at the top is long enough that you can put it slightly inside a Kong so that the dog can spend some time licking it out. I like to put this inside a Kong and then chill it in the freezer for several house. I live in Texas, so my dog loves this when it's really hot (all summer).	19
This is one of the best new titles to come along in quite a while. The 4 parts of this epic are spectacularly produced, marvelously written, finely acted, and are interesting, entertaining, engrossing and instructional all  at once.The detail of these productions is superb, as is the sense of  place and time. Adventure, history, drama, all percolate through these  works. The sea battles are astounding, the human dramas compelling.  Hornblower is heroic, but believable. He is human, but his humanity is of  an extraordinary sort. A compelling hero indeed!This series is a must!	15
Annoyed that I was giving this a gift and that it came so well packed but the box was still dented in all of the corners - which is really too bad since this was a gift. Love that the calculator works. Love that this can grow with the child. The parent of the child that I gave this to seemed less than thrilled since their kid is so connected with their personal ipad and kindel at age 4...but I really felt like this was a great gift that I would love for my child to receive. Hope the kid likes it...	22
I purchased this router table after reading many reviews on various products. I imagine most people completed their review prior to using it. The cabinet is beautiful, well constructed, and works well as a contractor unit.  However, I needed to purchase the &#34;large plate&#34; in order to fit my router, and am now stuck with a plate that with poor clearance to its optional rings.  The rings need to be shimmed every time you change them or your work witl catch on the plate. If I had to do it over, I would have spent the $$ on an Incra table top/fence.	21
Yes, my spring broke as well... but looking on the brighter side: when my son is old enough to walk he won't be able to accidently press the spring button to release the pail cover... it's kind of an unexpected safety feature! And yes, you can still open it with one hand... your fingers are not glued to one another. Really, diapers will stink no matter what pail you use.... The covered pail is cheap and doesn't require buying refill bags (especially since we use cloth diapers).	3
Out of four or five sets of goggles and masks this was the instant favorite for my 6 year old son.  It's a wide, comfortable, mask-like experience (without a nose cover) that avoids the problem of fit across the bridge of the nose.  I expect they generate more resistence than competitive type goggles, but they're a heck of a lot more comfortable -- I'm looking for an adult-size pair for myself.  The UV protection and smoke lens make solar-sensitive Daddy happy.  Oh, and the kids haven't managed to get the straps out of whack yet, which is a small miracle.	20
This book was slow to start but once I got into it I could not put it down.  It twisted and turned all over the place.  It was such a relief despite some of the more depressing points that it had a great happy ending.  The author did a great job giving Rosie the elephant human characteristics.  I liked that it was told from the point of view of an older man looking back.  Even his ending to the story was an amazing one.  I would definantly recommend this book to a friend.	5
"Very fast shipping!Inflates easily and stayed inflated well.The elastic harness Velcros, so it's safe and it's gives a small 1/4"" adjust-ability to their size.They do stick out quite a bit from the sides of the child, but I think it adds to the excitement for the child.a lot of fun, The material is the same as that as a blow-up pool, so there is some durability, but seriously you have to expect that it can easily be punctured just the same if you are not careful."	8
This is the updated Fantasy Flights version of HTMF. This game portrays you as a hungry penguin on the hunt for tasty fish. In doing so you must round up your fish before any rival penguins claim it for their own. Your game board per se consist of 40 hexagonal tiles and always changes. Some might complain that this takes awhile to set up, but if you have some help with your other player(s) set up is a breeze. Fantastic game, great price and best of all the WIFE loves it!	22
I also have a dark colored car that I used this on and did have some streaking. By re-applying another coat (being careful not to put too much on) corrected the problem as suggested by other reviewers. While the car really shines (I used a clay bar and detailer beforehand), the finish this product leaves is not slippery as regular waxes. This really isn't a problem, just don't expect a slick surface when you are done. I think the more I use it, the more I will like it.	2
I could not believe that the PC teck said that plunge routers all have play in the shaft. The right side has such play that you can tilt the router base by applying pressure to one side even when locked and he said this is normal! I have a RE600 Ryobi that is solid in all positions.  I tested the DeWalt621 and with one post it was solid.  The depth adjustment is also very hard to set, you have to turn it many revolutions to get it to adjust. The dust shield falls off easily. I returned it after one day.	21
I have never really seen many of these episodes but have heard they were really good, and since prime offered I decided what the heck lets see what the fuss is all about. Well I am now on Season 2 and I absolutely love watching it. Jax is a hottie and can make you drool, for sure. LOL I grew up with my step father in a similar atmosphere so watching these brought many memories from my childhood back, both good and bad. Just make sure you don't let the little people watch this, it can be a bit harsh.	0
I own several Perky-Pet brand items and have always loved their products.  I really love EVERYTHING about this squirrel-proof, EXTRA LARGE bird feeder; except for the price.I have 5 other feeders in my fenced-in yard and the birds in my yard flocked to the feeder on the very first day I hung it up.  No clogging, no squirrels, great design and super easy filling are the main things I really like about this feeder. If you don't mind the price, I would urge you to purchase this feeder.  It is undoubtedly my favorite feeder in my yard!Happy Feeding!	18
Came in neat factory pack marked Durablock*that doubles as storage case also.......Says 10 yrs Guaranteed....... Exp date shows as Dec. 2022 ....... Ordered for a small indoor Coleman Lantern that takes four & [2] O2 Cool portable fans that take 2 each.http://www.amazon.com/O2-Cool-Portable-Battery-Operated-Fan/dp/B001AVMSEY/ref=cm_cr-mr-titleAll into an Emergency supply kit in case we ever have a nasty power outage as happened the 1st week of July here in SW Va.......... temps in the 100's ........ Soon that kit will be turned into a coffee or end table....... using large black metal dog cage .. No point in hiding emergency supplies away -	12
This is a cute toy -- the FIRST hundred times you hear it.  With each successive LOUD repeat, though, you will find your sanity slipping away.  Do toy manufacturers think we're all hard-of-hearing?A child might give the fun rating here 4 stars but an adult would probably give it 2.  I think the suggestion of putting tape over the speaker area is a good one.It really is cute .... but be prepared to have &quot;quack quack, quack quack, quack quack quack quack, quack quack, quack quack, quack QUACK QUACK&quot; running through your head at the oddest moments.	22
"I have tried lots of different coffee brands this year, and this one, by far, is the best. Although I usually prefer a light roast, this medium roast is fantastic. There's nothing like Hawaiian Kona. The price is still reasonable for Kona beans, and this brand really is exceptional.I drink it black, so it has to be good. There's no attempt to hide the flavor of crappy beans by over-roasting. Or, even worse, adding ""flavorings"" to mask an inferior product.This coffee is very fine quality. Recommended."	11
I found the game to be alright. I love the real board game, so the I was pretty excited to play the computer version...But if you are expecting a version exactly like the game, this isn't it.  There are some changes, like  payback and all that. ITs fun to pick your people, and get your house and  all that.  Its cool how it goes through the decades and all that.  If you  liked the game, I think you'll like the board game, but be warned: Like the  game, the mroe people that play, the better.	23
I have had these for a couple years, and I think I use them almost every day. The locking feature is really handy, and easy to activate or deactivate--even with messy kitchen hands. The rubber is comfortable and gives you a sturdy, cool grip.I have one minor complaint, the tongs don't work well with delicate things. For example, with chicken parmesan, the breading rips right off. Now, we'll eat anything, so it isn't a big deal to us. I did notice that OXO makes a set of tongs that have rubber on the ends which may protect delicate foods.	13
I mostly wanted this for a house in PA that has rabbits eating the gardens and flowers every day, they are everywhere.  We have tried other sprays that have not really worked, or worked for a day or two and then the animals were back eating the leaves.  What I really liked about this Havahart repellant is that it works for deer, rabbits and squirrels, I don't need 3 different things.  It is very convenient with its own spray hose thing attached to it.  Very easy and convenient.	18
After the original SimCity came out I had thought it would be cool to have Sims based on other industries.  When I first heard of RCT I ran out and bought it.  Two years later, I still am not bored with it.The flexibility the game gives you in designing your own rollercoasters and theme parks is remarkable.  This is one game that lets the players creativity shine.If you like any of the Sim-games you will love RCT.  If you are trying to decide between this and ThemePark, choose RCT.  RCT has a more realistic feel, and better coaster design capabilities.	23
Does exactly what I would expect.  It just works!  Easy to pair with my Blackberry 8830, plenty of volume from the speaker.  People I call do not complain about voice quality so must be good enough!  Only slight negative is only included charging solution is a 12V car charger but Amazon does have a AC to 12V converter for about $12.  So far I have not bought it, claimed stand by time of 200 hours seems real so do not have to charge very often.  Auto shut off after 15 minutes of no blue-tooth connect helps save the battery.	7
This is my second time watching season II of BSG...I cried. After Sharon was saved by Tyrol and Aggethon and she pulled the blanket over her head and cried, I cried also. This show is unbelievable and sooooooooo good. When was Cdr Adama made an Admiral! This show made me change my mind on interrogating prisoners, especially women. I know I will get slammed for this, but I don't care. I'm a woman first and foremost, and above all is. This show speaks to so much.	0
This film leaves so much to be desired by the time the closing credits roll, you wonder why you sat through it in the first place. It appears to have absolutely no purpose... just meanders along violently... never giving... and there are few stories whether true or fictional that are better more exciting fare for good film-making than this -- so the plot was thick and ripe for an amazing movie experience... but they just didnt pull it off unfortunately. If you love the Jesus story you will be sadly dissappointed by this strange twisted desultory mess of a film.	15
I'm in my 24th year as host of a radio show on NPR-San Francisco. These are the headphones I've been using for the past four years: Great sound quality and as important, very light and comfortable on the ear, so I can keep them on for the entire show and never feel at all uncomfortable. If you want to look like a pro, these aren't for you. They look like what a teeny-bopper would wear. But if you want an amazing combination of sound quality, comfort, and low cost, these are great.	10
Contains the basics to clean your gun(s).  The tools are certainly adequate and perform as intended.  If you go to the range a 2 - 4 times a month and do a thorough job cleaning and lubing, you will run through the supplied pads and cleaner fairly quick (but don't over use the cleaner / lubricant).  The brush is a bit awkward for my little S&W Bodyguard .380, but it is functional and Q-tips work well of course.  For my 38 revolver and 40 S&W it is just fine.	20
The radar shows up and dots come up to show there is ghosts there. After a couple ghosts appear, your kindle or phone will start to say words. The first word my kindle said was construction. Later that day, I saw on the news that someone died in a construction accident near my house that day!  AHHHHHHH!!!! IT WAS TOTALLY CREEPY!!!!! If get creeped out easily don't get this app if you don't get creeped out you'll still get scared! BEWARE!!!	1
I have an auto alarm but the blinking led is in a place that is not noticeable to a potential thief. I put loop tape on the back and placed it on my dash and loaded it with 2 Amazon AAA batteries.  It has two flashing LEDs that alternated and really attracts attention.  Although it does have an on-off switch I left it on 24/7 for a Month and it's still going strong. Much longer than I expected.It is visible in the daytime so long as it's not 'directly' in the sun.Quite happy with this, good product.	2
You just can't be a Marvin Gaye fan and not own this one!  This brother was soooo before his time.Nobody has a voice like his. (....though Sam Cooke does come to mind, actually.  Not that they sound alike so much, but there is a PURE MUSICAL QUALITY to their voices that few others had then or have now.)This project is the bomb!  Though written several years ago, the message in the musicis still very relevant today!  And Marvin delivers like no one else can!FABULOUS	9
These are expensive but the quality is great and the fit is athletic without being restrictive.  I needed underwear for what they are designed for: washing in a hotel sink and throwing over a shower rod.  They dry super fast (few hours usually if hung in ample air circulation.  They are very comfortable, don't get damp.  The fit is a bit loose but in the right way: not dumpy and keep things where they are supposed to stay. Unlike cotton shirts, they don't wrinkle or look hammered after frequent use.	8
The Large size OXO Good Grips Salad Spinner seems to be well made. The gauge of plastic used is heavier than most other models, and the rubber-edged bottom keeps the spinner from sliding around. Easy to clean, and the cover can be disassembled for cleaning as well. Like anything mechanical made of plastic, caution and common sense are in order here: It will last longer if one doesn't press too hard or too quickly on the pump; a few more seconds of patience will put less stress on the mechanism, and keep it functioning longer.	13
Watching the fast-paced Irish step-dancing that dominates this performance, you wonder how the dancers can keep from falling over their own feet, extensive practice notwithstanding.  Though there are a few segments that seem out of place (a flamenco dancer, a sequence featuring a black ensemble), most of the video is made up of dance numbers using traditional instruments and footwork from the Emerald Isle.  When I first watched it I was blown away.  I still am.  If you have only *one* dance performance video in your collection, this should be it.	6
I thought this game looked like it would be great-- but it turned out that it was boring, irritating, not to mention that it has bugs- my computer is almost brand new, and this game would crash every five minutes. A few months later I bought Roller Coaster Tycoon, and I became addicted to it- I LOVE it!  If you are interested in this game, I recommend that you buy Rollercoaster Tycoon instead, it's a lot more fun, and it doesn't have bugs- don't waste your money on Sim ThemePark!	23
We like it that this diaper pail uses regular garbage bags instead of specialty diaper pail inserts/liners.  The mechanism works well to dispose of the diapers and attempt to keep the smell isolated, but at a certain level of the room (usually nose-height when you're sitting on the floor) you can still smell poo.  It works well to bundle the diapers into compact little bundles and use the velcro to seal the bundles before you put it in the diaper hole.  Overall, we are very satisfied.	3
Disclaimer: I am reviewing the product, the programmable Rover, that was offered to me for free through the Vine program.Unfortunately I never received the product! The package must have gotten lost in shipping. So I'm sorry but I cannot review the actual product, as much as we were looking forward to trying it.However, now Amazon Vine is changing their policy so I am required to write a review, even though I never received the product in question. So I'm sorry but please disregard this review...	22
Obviously there must have been an issue with a lot of the players that were made with this model #, but I haven't seen it. I've had the player for 6 years + and never had one issue with it. its the first and only stand alone dvd player i've had and works wonderfully. I also own 2 sony tvs, a sony reciever and vcr and satellite system and haven't once had an issue. I think that sony has continued their product quality no matter where they're built.	10
This isn't as 'sexy' as some bras, but it looks GREAT under clothes, and is supportive without feeling constrictive. Sometimes when this is sold in outlets, something is 'off' in the material; it's a little scratchy....but from Bali or as this was sold from Amazon, it's l00% right.  Washes well and lasts so much better than some of the fragile bra fabrics.  Maybe not so special for 'date night', but for a great bra to wear all week, it's terrific.	8
This gun stock finish is just about the simplest applying finish I've found.  The instructions provide various options for application, but I have found that rubbing on with a finger provides the best control and results.  Proper attention to wood preparation prior to application pays big dividends.  Waiting 12 hours between coats is a must.  If blemishes have occurred, light rubbing with 0000 steel wool followed by a rub down with an alcohol dampened cloth prior to another coat can result in a near mirror finish.  Have finished six different stocks and won't use anything other finish product.	20
Fun game for the whole family! Takes a few rounds to play without having to think too hard. Enough detail to make playing often enjoyable. I have played this a few times with my husband and two sons (11 and 16). We have made a habit of playing family games at least every couple of weeks. Often we will play a game every evening during holiday breaks from school. I am impressed by this game and hope to purchase other Days of Wonder games in the future. They are a bit pricey, but much better than you average board game.	22
First can I say that the seller of these candy bars is very thoughtful and they included and ice pack so the chocolates didn't melt in shipping. I grew up eating these candy bars in Africa so was delighted when I found them here at amazon. The honeycomb center is crunchy and melts in your mouth along with the milk chocolate coating. The only problem with these candy bars is they don't last long. They are that good and once others in your family find out about them they will disappear even more quickly. Maybe order 12!~The Rebecca Review	11
Is the the best pedal ever? Not even close. Does it do EXACTLY what you want a simple slap-back echo/reverb to do? Absolutely! I almost always have it on just to add a little depth to my synth or guitar sound. It can give you a decently wet surf-ish sound or a fast delay, rockabilly sound. It's not super versatile but if you're looking for a little depth and color for under $20 then this is what you need.I mean, COME ON! It works, it's cheap, and it doesn't take up much room on your pedal board!	16
This headset works very well for me. I was skeptical at first about the plastic thing over my ear, but it's so light that I scacely notice. I also worried becuase the mike wound up next to my cheek not my mouth, but it seems to have no adverse effect on the sound. People I'm talking to can't tell I'm using it, and to me the sound is great. At the price, what's not to like? I got one for each phone in our house.	10
These picks far exceed my expectations, I mean how good could a pick be anyway?  These are the classiest, nicest looking picks I own.  They look great, feel great and play great.  Call me a snob, but I wanted these to match my Fender Stratocaster.  Kind of like using a GM part on my 68 Chevelle..If you own a Fender and want to spend just a few bucks for a &#34;feel good&#34; gift to yourself, buy these.I love the color and texture too, they don't slip or move around as you play.	16
I was a big fan of their other game, Radiant HD, so I was expecting another great one here. Although this isn't my typical genre of game, the premise is promising. Unfortunately, the game is ruined by a tiny control pad in order to navigate around. Yes, you can move the joystick location by holding down it down, but my issue is with the size of it. It is simply just too small, so you're constantly pressing on the wrong direction or area. Fix this minor problem and this game would get five stars from me!	1
I've always worn Levi's jeans. Recently, however, they don't seem to last like they used to. Jeans that I have bought within the last 5 years or so, seem to wear out faster than older pairs I've had. Particularly around the pockets and the seam in the crotch. The material seems thinner too. While this makes them a tiny bit more comfortable, they don't make 'em like they used to. Still kinda expensive too, but they go on sale every once in a while. Or I can use points to buy.	8
I drink this tea because it is supposed to be great to boost the female reproductive system.  I drink it daily with no sweetener and I really like it.  I haven't noticed any huge differences with my hormones or cramps yet but I think I will keep drinking this tea for a long time.  I have heard it is also good for strengthening the uterus during pregnancy (but I think you are supposed to be careful and maybe wait until the 2nd trimester to drink it).  Check out MamaNatural for more info on that topic.	11
I have used this product on my computer for many years, but are the values the true value or deflated values.  It seems with the real estate downfall, no one knows the true value of their home these days.  And if you are trying to buy or sell, people go to Zillow to see what they value the property.  I think we should go back to what appraisers think the property is worth, because realtors do not know any more.  They and the banks are the ones who got us into this trouble, only my opinion.	1
The Energizer Bunny of saws - it keeps cutting and cutting and cutting.  I used it to cut a few plastic lawn chairs headed to the trash-easy stuff.  I used it to cut PVC pipe for a plumbing project-nice, clean straight cuts.  I cut up a rusty BBQ grill-well because I wanted to-very easy.  No binding, no stalling.  The assorted blade package is a nice add-on, a blade for every job.  You won't want any other saw.	21
Need to rinse off and I also add boiling water for  1-2 mins, drain, then add more to reconstitute. With almost every commercially dried food some sort of preservatives are added. The initial rinse & quick soak removes all traces ( I think) .Flavor is great. Color, large pieces, not much crumbled.  Price for the quality is very cheap IMO. Fabulous staple, great for cream of mushroom soup. ( btw, using Greek yogurt with low/no fat milk is a fabulous & tasty substitute for cream)Will be ordering these as I need.	11
"These are designed to cover plugs you leave plugged in, such as lamps or alarm clocks, so keep kids from pulling on the plugs/cords and damaging them or injuring themselves.  And that's exactly what they do.  We use several in our home and have had no problems.  They're also very easy to install with a simple screwdriver.Many of the negative reviews here complain either it is too hard to open (which is completely the point) or that it only holds ""small"" (aka standard) plugs, which should be obvious from the description and picture, so they're not really being fair."	3
I hate wrapping gifts, so I really liked how easy the tape made it.  You couldn't see the fingerprints, it has a nice finish to it, and the pieces are precut to a nice short length.  I found this all very helpful.  I read on one of the reviews that there was a complaint about the amount of tape that was on these rolls, and I have to agree that there wasn't as much, but for me that was a minor negative.  I think this tape is pretty great and sure is convenient.	17
Dr. Thorndyke delves into early forensic science or in the language of his age, medical jurisprudence. He is a mixture of Sherlock Holmes and Gideon Oliver. The books include two novels and two books of short stories. They are all well written and fun to read although I chose 4 stars because they also tend to be repetitive. Thorndyke is always reviewing all the facts of the case meaning we get to read the same information at least twice. I enjoyed the volume though and would recommend it for light easy reading ~ especially if you are at all interested in bodies and bones.	14
Since this is the third hanger I have purchased it goes without saying that I really like it. My only criticism is that it ships with mounting hardware that is for a &#34;brick&#34; wall. I am fairly sure that 90%+ of those of us that use these hangers mount them on a plasterboard wall. How about shipping it with a suitable wall anchor for drywall? Otherwise, a great hanger that I trust for use with my expensive guitars.I'm just running out of wall space and money for new guitars.	16
The one I got did not have very much of the neon yellow rubber thing on the tip of the screw. I feel like if I tighten it too much, I could dent my mic stand tube. But I haven't dented anything yet, so perhaps I'm just too skeptical. In any event, it seems like a better design might make it easier to get attachments tightened down and facing the right direction. But everything works. It's getting the job done and I haven't seen a better option. All in all, a pretty good device.	16
It saddens me to write this review because I've been using Buf Puf since I was about 12. I always attributed my youthful appearance to daily exfoliation with the Buf Puf, but now I think my cystic acne in my 30's and 40's was certainly exacerbated if not caused by the Buf Puf. I discontinued use of this product and switched to a skin care line called Glytone (buy at Dermstore.com) and haven't had a breakout in over 2 months. Unfortunately I'm convinced the harsh exfoliation causes skin to rebel and break out. I won't use again.	4
What a great idea!  I love Scrabble, but even in the magnetic portable versions, it's not quite as portable as I'd like.  Cards are much easier to carry and there's less likelihood of losing a card from a deck than a letter from Scrabble.Both the multi-player and the Solitaire options of this game are a lot of fun.  Plus, there's excellent educational value in both learning to spell and strategize.I'm hoping the company brings out a version of this game for my iPhone. It's a lot of fun and I enjoy the different challenge.Rebecca Kyle, February 2009	22
I marvel at the clever scripts. I marvel at the assemblage visuals to support the inventive scripts. I marvel at the actors that pull this off. The film editor must be a genius to intertwine all the pieces in to a cohesive story line. BRAVO! Making all the pieces fit into the premise of this inspired &#34;who done the bad deed&#34; is astonishing to me. Body language and facial clues expose everyone to scrutiny. This is the most &#34;unique&#34; show I've seen in years. pat on the back to all .. and five stars from me.. to you...	0
There are always strong opinions about almost everything Karajan recorded, both on CD and DVD and whether or not you like him as a conductor ... or a video director.  This late video shows the maestro in his last years.  It shows his feelings about the music after the wear of his years, in a setting where he is in complete control ... his favorite position.  The orchestra plays beautifully.  The video is fine.  If you have strong feelings about Karajan (pro or con) you can forget them in this instance.  This is a great recording.	6
I have owned this bench/kneeler for some years and would not part with it.  It is lightweight but amazingly strong.  It is a ready made seat for me in the garage, and it doesn't take up much space.  I am (unfortunately) 175 pounds, and this bench supports me easily.  Because of arthritis, the kneeler option is a must for me out in the garden not just because of my knees but because the bench's legs will help me stand up.  This is money well spent for anyone you know who is a serious gardener.	18
This is another app that i cannot go without, I live in an area where we get fires, and this app is amazingly helpful, and i don't have to carry a scanner with me, all i have to do is start the app and select the channel and i'm listening just like that,this app does everything from citizen to fire and police and rescue channels, If you want to know what is going on around you but either don't own a scanner, or don't want to carry one this app is for you!	1
I love this movie, and Dr. Ben Carson. What an accomplishment his life was, and is. Overcoming poverty and excelling in the field of medicine. His mother had a beautiful soul, and she knew what a person could achieve in life, with dedication, and hard work. She seemed to know just how to direct her boys. Not only to excellence for Dr. Carson, but she herself overcame un surmountable obstacles. This movie shows what dedicated love, and trust can produce. I have watched this movie many, many times. Never tire of it.	15
I used it on a recent spark plug install and I guess it will work OK.  Well, it was a little messy going on and I didn't have any trouble with the install.  But, I really won't know how well it works until I remove the plugs - hopefully, years from now.  :-D  So, maybe Amazon will still be around by then and I can give an update when that happens.  Either it works or it don't - we'll see.  :-)	2
This rotisserie cooks great.  It adds another dimension to cooking on the Weber grill.  Like some mentioned in the other reviews, the rotisserie does not have a real tight fit with the lower half of the Weber grill.  I don't understand why Weber just did not make the bottom lip of the rotisserie the same as that of the grill cover.  Then it would have been a perfect fit.But regardless, the rotisserie works and cooks great.  I expect many years of rotisserie cooking with this piece of equipment on my grill.	18
Mega Man Legends revolutionized The Blue Boy wander forever.Mega's 1st 3-D appearence.I strongly suggest that you buy this game.$15 is an awesome price.In the game,Mega Man is looking for the &quot;Mother Load&quot;,the greatest prize of &quot;Diggers&quot;.Mega Man also thinks that if they find it,it might help solve the mystery about Roll's past.In the game,you can find air shoes(the famous X &quot;dash&quot;)and the famous helmet.You start with Mega Man having no helmet,but thts cool. You can also get special weapons,like the sword and a drill.I would say this,and this only....BUY THIS GAME NOW!	23
Does a great job of presenting and integrating the app store as well as installation. The other marketplaces could learn a lot from the Amazon Appstore App. There is just one frustrating failing that really needs to be addressed soon. If you delete an app and REALLY don't want it any more there is NO WAY to remove it from your list of Apps in the Appstore App. It just sits there forever, cluttering up the interface. Huge over sight that quickly devalues the interface and usability for anyone that (un)installs more than a few apps.	1
"I can't simply understand nature of such negative feedbacks.Don't like sound quality/durability/usability/etc? - Check price tag, scratch your head, try to find same durability/usability/etc for same price, I bet you can't.So this headphones perform amazingly well, compared to their $12 price tag. So don't expect $100 quality from these.If you still wonder what quality of sound these have, here's comparison with other KOSS products. This (The Plug), sounds worse than Koss Porta Pro, but sounds better than Koss UR10 (but you need heavy EQ usage to actually set these ""plugs"" to be better then UR10). Hope this helps."	10
I'm unsure what I'm rating here... I buy all of my tunes from Amazon, the prices are usually fair, there's no DRM telling me what I can and cannot play it on or how many times I can listen to it before it disappears (iTunes and Wally World, for instance). I've also noticed that I can buy explicit (uncensored) music at Amazon, I absolutely HATE listening to a tune where they've chopped and butchered it to make it &#34;clean&#34;!!! Not much &#34;storage&#34; space for things purchased in the past, so I store it on Google...	1
I have really thick, hard to curl, dry, asian hair. This iron did not work for me at all.  The iron did not get hot enough to do anything. I guess it would work if I did small one-inch sections, but I have so much hair, it's just not worth the time.  The waves it did create were fizzy and ugly.My friend, who has thin hair, uses this iron all the time and it works great.I recommend the Hot Tools Deep Waver.  It worked a lot better on my hair and created well defined waves.	4
Strong, reliable lock.  Shank is long enough to make it useful in securing trigger of rifle with trigger guard molded into synthetic stock, involving complex curves in three dimensions, of all weather Benjamin Trail.  No keys to add to already overworked keyring.Would have preferred a four digit combination and high contrast numerals.  Seems to me likely to be stronger and more secure than a Frantzen combination trigger lock with a different locking mechanism I have on another gun, but I find the Frantzen easier to read and work with.	20
LASERBLAST is a nearly plot-free sci-fi film about a man who finds an alien laser weapon, becomes possessed by it, and goes berserk. It's the perfect fodder for immolation by Mike and his silly sidekicks. LASERBLAST -like MANOS: THE HANDS OF FATE, BRIDE OF THE MONSTER, THE BEAST OF YUCCA FLATS, etc.-  is a schlock classic in its own right. As such, the unintentional humor tends to make the MST3K guys' job a lot easier! The jokes sort of write themselves!...	0
Those of you who are not into true to life inspirational stories--please just move on.The rest of us who can draw inspiration from people who may (or may not) have had it worse than us, Gifted Hands is an excellent, wonderful story.I'm certain many others have chimed in the highlights of the film, so let me just say that the acting and direction was superb.  I've seen Cuba Gooding Jr. in many roles previous to this, and I have to say that this was one of his best performances.Atheists may not like this story, but if so, that's your loss.	15
"Essential for any and all Siouxsie & The Banshees fans. Sure, it's an early compilation, with material from 1978-81. Every one of the CD's ten cuts are a winner, like ""The Staircase Mystery"", ""Love In A Void"", the insanely written ""Happy House"", ""Christine"", ""Israel"", ""Spellbound"" (one of my all time favorites) and ""Arabian Knights"". Top rate goth alternative. It's nearly impossible not to like at least a couple of these tunes. Sounds just SO good, that it almost hurts. Voodoo enthusiasts, fortune tellers and goth queens, rejoice! Highly recommended."	9
I loved it-I had seen this movie many years ago and loved it then&#62; I love Richard Burton-He's so deep in this movie-very young and very deep. What a brillant actor he is and became.I gave it five stars because the quality of him overall deserved it.Olvia De Havilland-wow what a brillant star she is. Between the two of them-wow! how different they are-but this movie brought a side we never saw before.Thank you -for the opportunity to share my views.	15
I wanted to like this a lot.  Turns out it's merely ok.  When you push the button OMG HERE COMES HOPPES #9.  It's great for those hard to reach places when you don't mind a puddle of Hoppes.  But it's definitely not for precision work.  I'm puzzled by the reviewer who complained about the smell. It smells like Hoppes #9.  Works like Hoppes #9.  Three stars for function.  Five stars for the product that I've used forever.	20
If you have the full folding single stand this works quite well but the ones with the rounded neck that is one piece with no hinge are a bit tight for length.  OK quality but not as good as the stands themselves which are all fantastic.  I don't understand how people can spend thousands or even hundreds on a guitar and then buy an 8 dollar stand only to see their guitar fall over or get damaged at the neck.  If you pay attention to the prices you can really get some great deals on Amazon... untouchable deals ...	16
As a Christmas gift to a friend, I am helping her feed the birds.  She is confined to a wheelchair so watching the birds gives her and her cats a lot of pleasure.  We wanted to draw an assortment of birds, not just sparrows.  This feeder is drawing tit mice, gold finches and a few cardinals but not sparrows.  The squirrels have continued to be thwarted by it and it holds enough feed that I think I can fill it once a week.  We are very pleased with it!	18
This is one of those games that can go hours and hours.It can be fun, or a real drag if you get stuck in the begining with a few lousy countries/territories and the other players gang up on you.This is definitely not a good child/adult game or even a good game for fun party play, it takes too much time and several players always end up losing early on, leaving the other players, sometimes just two of them, going back and forth for a long time.It's a good strategy war based game, it just needs to be played with the right crowd.	22
You just bought the best saw money can, the Milwaukee. Now, I agree, this should be in the box, but seeing how you get what you pay for, and some fools will actually compare price on Milwaukee with (Brand B). Milwaukee chose to make this an extra, probably to hold the line on the saw. Now, you aren't actually going to cheat yourself because they hafto market to fools are you? OF course not. So just buy it. What are you reading this for?	21
Another great season but a bit choppy. For some reason there were a couple of episodes mixed up or somthing. At the beginning Angela and Hodges were engaged but then in the middle of the season there is a couple of episodes where Hodges is trying to ask her to marry him.It was a bit confusing. THere is a episode about horses and humans running around pretending to be horses.It was rather disgusting. The best part about that episode is the last five minutes when the two main characters are discussing the days work.	0
I played this along time ago and was immersed until the end. It was on my old PC and the graphics were top notch but I could not play at full copacity...I am now going to play it on my new gaming pc and it shall rock..This game is beutiful, challenging, full of action and smarts. The idea behind the game play is awesome. The worlds and characters are realistic and belivable...so, put on that Halo and get ready to be plunged into a new futuristic world!!!	23
Unfortunately Futurma is following the pattern of Family Guy.  The season sets have fewer episodes and are more expensive.  I do think it was just as strong as prior seasons. My favorite was the I Phone episode.  I wish that Futurama would do more TV science fiction parody type shows.  I have to wonder if they rotate writers between the Simpsons and Family guy because the humor is very uneven in some episodes.  If the writing keeps improving I would like to see Futurama run twenty seasons like the Simpsons.	0
I cannot praise this series enough. This is a great example of tight and taunt script writing and acting. A man on the brink and flirting with self-destruction is brilliantly portrayed by Idris Elba and his supporting cast. If you want gripping engrossing and fast paced TV drama .. this one is absolutely for you. I have watched all available seasons (on this and other sites) at least twice, (this one thrice) and enjoy it as much each time I watch. Idris Elba is an acting talent, or rather a force, that can rarely be equaled.	0
Don't be fooled by the number of tracks (four) - you definitely get your money's worth on this one.  Isaac Hayes really showcases his ability to rework standards by composers like Burt Bacharach and Jimmy Webb.  You would never believe these weren't written to be mellow grooving soul.  From the cynical, ironic, Gen-X perspective, the intro to &quot;Phoenix&quot; seems a little too long and silly, but by the last few minutes of the song, you finally see where he was going with it.	9
"I don't write many app reviews ... because most range from useless to ""eh"". TuneIn Radio, however, is incredibly useful and amazingly fun! I can listen to local radio stations, public access radio (scanners, health services), and a huge number of world-wide stations of all sorts; both over the air and internet, including my favorite melodic pop station, Alan Haber's Pure Pop Radio!! My Kindle is now my radio, as well as my book and my gameboy! Happy am I!!!!"	1
Not much to say about this product except that it works exactly as it's supposed to. I have an HTC Inspire 4G and it works great with it, as it should with any Micro-USB device. The blue glowing Motorola logo is neat looking, but also makes the product bigger than needed...not a downside just figured I should mention it. I would reccomend it as a vehicle charger for anyone with a micro-usb device, especially someone with a smart phone since their battery life usually is not so great.	7
It was a little smaller than I expected, but that was actually a plus in my book. It feels durable and I like the fact that there is not a bug tray for collecting dead bugs. If you were using this on your deck or something, may that would be a different story, but you are really not supposed to use it where you will be sitting anyway. I sprinkled a pile of dietamaceous earth underneath this on the ground so that any crawling bugs like ants that come to feast on the new fried bug bits will meet their demise as well.	18
Musicfriends, This is a fab item - For 20.00 You can't go wrong on this. Warm distortion and good controls. For me great studio/recording use but thats it. I would certainly not tour with it... its built cheap w. plastic housing and one circuit board squeezed in and funny enough the one piece rugged metal... is the bottom plate. Hello designers.... Metal around top and plastic on the bottom if you must. But anyways, bottom line great unit for 20.00 and sounds good very versatile.	16
This is a great follow up to Fate of Atlantis, and it's nice to see Indy jumped into 3D. The textures are really nice, and it carries a lot of Typical Indy puzzles. Sure it looks  a lot like Tomb Raider, but you know Indy was there first. This game needs to be ported to PS. The only downfall is theat the programming is a little tempermental in Win2000, but then again, what isn't? Plus there are patches for this game. this is worth the buy. You won't be disappointed.	23
I didn't give it 5 stars because I want one in an industrial ink model the samea s these originals. All to often the ink washes out when you need it or fades out too. Sometimes that's what you want but when you don't an industrial ink would be lovely. I know the Extra Fine Sharpies come in both regular ink and an industrial version. That's what I'm talking about Sharpie....then again what's not to like. We buy extra fines, wide and chisels and fine and ULTRA fines even. NO real competition out there.	17
I will state why I like and don't like the Dreamcast._pros_Good graphics4 controller ports56K modem built in2 mem. card slots per controllersmall size_cons_very NOISYno dvd playervery small amount of gamesthe games stink!cheap controllersEven though the Ps2 is alot better system the Dreamcast is cool. It was far ahead of its time though. And the games were absolutely horrible. There were very few good ones and no, Sonic is not one of them. Athough it is a good system I would recommend getting a Playstation 2. The Dreamcast is dead and they are not making any more games for it.	23
It's a neat idea...the problem is...the replacement bags cost too much and don't justify the convenience.  Honestly, my husband and I use the plastic bags that the daily newspaper comes in.  They are slim and hold about 7-10 diapers.  At the end of the day, we toss them out into the garage...end of story.  If you really need this kind of doodad, there is another type out there where you can use your own plastic bag...that's much better than this deal.	3
I really enjoy playing this game.  In the beginning I found it a bit confusing compared to Age of Empires (an absolutely excellent game), so I didn't really like it.  I eventually became better and now I find it very fun to play.  It is set in the future and you can have your choice of who/what you are.  There are some really cool aliens.  Take a look at this game.  It's great for someone who likes stragedy!  Planning your next move against the enemy.  Highly recommended!!	23
"This is one of those books that, when the end comes you want to flip it over and start again.  It begins with a scene from the climax of the book - a real page-turner.  A fantastic hook!Action bounces from ""present day"", then back to the 30s, then back again. Both settings appear to be thoroughly researched and are written with authority.  The author IS a 93 year old man AND a 20-something circus vet - even though she is a young woman.You will NOT be able to put this book down."	5
This is the story of a group of butterflies looking for a place to sleep. Each one is a different color, and each pair of facing pages (color-coordinated, of course!) tells the story of where each of the butterflies found to sleep. Each of the butterflies is shown as a brightly-colored, foil-looking toy that your little one will not be able to resist touching.My little one absolutely loved this book, and it did go great as a preparing for sleep read. The colors and the butterflies, and the cute story all were a hit. We both highly recommend this book!	13
"Prior to the release of the marvelous ""Live At The Royal Albert Hall"", this DVD is also something special. Biased as this review may be, since I am a fan from David Gilmour from his first solo release to his last effort ""On An Island"". The acoustic versions of some well known songs, ""Shine On You Crazy Diamond"" for instance, gives this set a feeling that you are witnessing an artist filled with divine inspiration and good taste. The DVD includes performances by Richard Wright and Michael Kamen, both brilliant musicians that departed too early!"	6
I'm 75 years old, and I've been applying this gel every night for the past five or six years.  There's no way of knowing if the wrinkles would be worse without it, but I think it's helping, and it feels so wonderful when I apply it before getting into bed at night.The jar doesn't hold too much, but you use very little with each application.  And the 2-Pack is more economical than buying one at a time at a retail store.A good product at a fair price.	4
If you like scheming, justice, complete DISREGARD for justice, rooting for and against different characters at different times, brutality, and the possibility of anyone being able to die at any given time then you'll love this series. Good luck trying to read this book to fall asleep at night. If you've already watched the HBO series just remember that NO television depiction has ever come close to fully capturing the books they came from. After you finish this series (whenever it ends) you'll be googling &#34;books like Game of Thrones&#34; to find your next read.	5
I am shocked that this is network television. I would never have guessed had someone not mentioned it in another review. I am not surprised that it only got one season. There are alot of wonderful things about this show. Crafted well, acting is first rate, and while some of the plot lines are predictable, they are written and performed well. It's a great premise and the possibilities are sadly left unfulfilled. Would that it had a chance to grow into what it might well have been - one of the best things on network tv.	0
I was using a basket to hold wipes, lotions, etc and keeping on the changing table.  My daughter is growing and is very long so the basket was in the way.  I looked everywhere for a hanging basket but couldn't find one I liked for a decent price.  This diaper  depot is absolutely perfect.  It hangs perfectly on my changing table.  I did put a piece of fabric under it so the finish doesn't get scratched on the changing table.  I love having everything right there at changing/dressing time without taking up drawer space.	3
This product is an excellent buy and at 1/4th the cost at any store or online sites.  My family loves the product and recommend this product as a great buy.  I even subscribed so the product  is delivered without having to go and order it.  The product just comes when I decide how often.  This is a wonderful program which recommend to all who use products and not have to go and order it over and over!!  A must buy with an awesome program to make it easier to get the best at a good cost :)	12
The mix of smooth and ridged surfaces is a nice touch aesthetically and it also helps to keep a nice grip as all smooth can be a bit slippery. The case fits like a glove and all the holes and cuts outs fit the various ports perfectly. The price on this item is hard to beat and it arrived quickly. I haven't tried it with any of the fun NFC features yet, but I'm not anticipating any problems.All in all, if you're looking for a nice, simple bumper case I suggest you look no further (assuming the price is still good).	7
What's to say - this is an OEM HP ink cartridge from HP.  It performs exactly as you'd expect.  The price from amazon is good.  The only way you'll typically beat their price on this is either buying in bulk at a warehouse club  or to buy a remanufacturered cartridge or ink kit.  The former is risky as printer prices drop so fast you can end up with more ink than you need at a price higher than a new printer, and the latter which can be messy and sometimes impact print quality if you get low end stuff.	17
I love balsamic vinegar, and have tried several brands. I decided, since this one had such great reviews, to try it even though it is quite expensive.It blew my socks off!It is incredible balsamic vinegar. Actually perfect!When I dribbled it on a dinner salad I prepared, I felt like I was in Heaven.A few weeks after I purchased it from Amazon, I was visiting a local gourmet market and they had the same bottle  marked at twice the price!I cannot recommend this balsamic highly enough.Truly the best!	11
To say this is a different twist on Zombies. I am a huge Zombie fan and always have been. I keep my mind open on a subject that tends to have some strict rules for some people. Some of this I liked but I am still having a hard time wrapping my ind around the concept of Zombies with different levels of power and intelligence. I did enjoy the story but am not sure that I would classify it as Zombies because it does stray to far at times outside the rules. The main characters are likeable and I found myself rooting for MAx.	14
"Rush has delivered...I am trying to find the right combination of words to describe this album but it is difficult...first and foremost it is a bloody beautiful album...the music, the lyrics, the arrangements, everything flows so perfectly, smoothly...it is beautiful...There is a huge amount of maturity yet it is also very powerful and fresh at the same time...the music is so enthusiastic, it is impossible to believe that it is the 38th year these guys are making music...I am listening to the album while writing this review and i am smiling...Neil, Geddy, Alex i salute you...Rush is certainly NOT ""losing it""..."	6
"If you are looking for a very light and compact device to read your books, check your e-mail and watch movies, you really can't beat the Nook HD. It has the highest screen resolution for its form factor (7"") and is a pleasure to read and write with. Netflix & Hulu+ are magical to view since the resolution is so high and it's so darn light. Being able to expand the memory with a micro SD card is just another plus. All-in-all, I'm very pleased with it an would recommend it highly!"	10
This TV guide app works dependable and is very easy to start up.  I do receive cable channel info.  It is better than a paper guide.  There is no info for Sundance Channel and I watch that a lot.  It is most convienent to scan channels on a format that has 3 hour programs posted ahead of that time.  You can plan ahead on what you would like to watch.  This was an easy download and you pick your cable station, etc. which it lists (every possible choice). Pretty neat app...a keeper.  Try it...you'll like it!	1
These pens are what they are meant to be: felt porous pens, indeed. They are very good at writing, drawing, doodling, etc.You should know *this*, though: these pens are very bright in color, much like highlighters. That might be problematic when writing something you might want to go back and re-read afterwards, or when using in a notebook, later to be turned in to a teacher.The colors are much brighter than it seems. It might be a selling point for you guys. To me it was a bit of a bummer.	17
Another reviewer noted a scene that was cut due to content, I wouldn't have remembered it if they hadn't told me:( But other than that the picture looks as good as it possibly can, only a few times does it show it's age. Overall this is an interesting video, with lots of great performances, some videos and humor thrown in. If you like Michael Jackson this is a must have, if you are a fan of 80s music/videos you would definitely be pleased as well.	6
Purchased these for a new Heritage H-575 arch top.  A few months later, the high E string unwound from the ball end.  Overall good strings, good sound -- this set simply didn't last very long.  I will replace with 12s however.  For me the 11s felt a little loose.  The 12s will likely improve the sound of the jazz box.  I have 12s on an Epiphone Joe Pass model.  I'll be curious to hear how the 12s sound incomparison to the 11s.	16
At first, the dialogue was a bit jarring for me -- but I quickly adjusted and grew to appreciate its merits.This is a show with fantastic characters, and three-dimensional antagonists.  Jack is my favorite character, despite being an antagonist, and he goes through some very real and identifiable struggles.  This is incredible fiction.The series ends on an ambiguous note -- it doesn't really work as a series finale -- but this 13-hour journey is something I've watched three times from start to finish because it is such a delight.	0
I Got tons of stuff on Bird,Mingus,a few on Powell&amp;Roach&amp;a few on Dizzy.but having all of that Genius on Set makes up big time.The Music&amp;Arrangements are Incredible.Bird changed the Game Forever.He is  One Of Jazz's Greatest Pioneers.DIzzy blows The Mind with His Tone.Miles  Davis always gave him Mad Props.Roach is one of the Greatest Drummers ever  in any Style of Music.Powell Rings up Keys&amp;has been featured on Many  Important Recordings.Mingus who I got turned onto a Couple Years back is  Amazing.Simply put.His Tones&amp;Drives are Gold too the Ears.Very  Essential.	9
"I bought this because ""others"" bought it with the case I purchased. It was one of those last minute ""checkout"" decisions. I should have read the reviews better. Worked for a day after I received it then my 4th Gen iPod touch gives a message the charger isnt supported. The reviews are a little scary. The last thing I want is to fry my iPod. Not sure if I will bother returning it considering the price. I will probably keep the retractable cable and toss the chargers."	7
I like mic stands with folding legs (like this) as opposed to weighted bases, since they're easier to travel with.  Quality-wise, this stand feels solid, but not amazing &#8211; it's a mixture of plastic and metal construction.  For the price I paid (around $25), it's a nice piece of kit and everything holds as it should.  It also folds down pretty well.  Note that it does not include any kind of microphone clip or mount, so you'll need to provide your own.  The cable clips are a nice touch.	16
I am a quadriplegic with very little hand dexterity and find cutting and chopping extremely difficult and time consuming. A good friend gave me one of these as a gift in the 1980s. That one lasted around 12 years(!!!) I just burned-out my second one: and now I'm here to buy my third! It's very easy to operate, even for a quad!!It really works fast and the processing mechanism is made well. I have processed things as soft as olives to as hard as almonds, and this machine tackles them all very nicely and clean-up in easy.	13
My daughter wasn't drinking out of the bottle. The laytex nipple was the only one shes takes. Its soft and is the most like a breast. But  I  didn't know why she wouldn't drink the bottle until I smelled the milk.  It had gone bad. So I learned that if you heat the milk ( not boil it) right after you pump then store it in good bags the milk stays fresh, and baby eats while i'm at work.  There is no better feeling for you (and grandma whos watching her)  when you know that shes happy while you are at work.	3
I am extremely pleased with the tools performance.  The price may seem a little high but it's worth every penny. It's ideal for overhead and down-drilling applications, the D-handle design on this rotary hammer gives you extra control.  This Bosch rotary hammer has proven itself to be an asset, it's well used from every day use, runs great, has minimum vibration, yet delivers maximum impact force!! I would recommend it for individuals who work at job site areas where power is either difficult to obtain or unavailable.	21
The Diaper Genie is great.  It helps eliminate diaper odors, thanks to the slightly powder scented bags, and that it seals off each dirty diaper.  It's convenient,  VERY easy to use, and most of all sanitary.  We'll have this thing filled to the gills with dirty diapers, and you wouldn't even know that any stinky diapers were in the baby's room!  When it is filled, just turn the knob to cut the bag, tie off, throw out, and start all over again with fresh clean bags!	3
I had the older version of this from a couple of years back, and that older one felt stronger - and is still going strong. I got this one for my husband, and I did not like it nearly as much. The water tends to splatter more than my old one, and the vibration is bigger but not deeper.For the price I paid, though, it was fine. I just can't justify giving it 5 stars when it doesn't add up to the quality of its previous versions.	12
Dee Knight had a really great story line here that could have yielded a fantastic book. This is a sweet story. She did a great job with the characters, I would have loved to see her expand it. The sex is too short, the scenes are too short. It's difficult to get worked up about anything that happens in the story. I'd love to see her rewrite it and lengthen it out!(71 pages per Amazon, but a lot of excerpts from other Samhain Publishing are included.  This publisher has may favorite author Lorelei James.)	14
Ignore the positive reviews for these batteries folks.  Better you should trust the negative comments and save yourself the hassle of returning dead batteries.  I should have known when they arrived that something was wrong:  They were shipped in a generic clamshell-type package with no label or indication they were made by Duracell - not at all as pictured and a red flag for fakes.  Note to seller:  How long did you think you'd get away with selling dead (and possibly fake) batteries?  Note to Amazon:  Please investigate this seller!	12
This season 1 and all other seasons in this series is very educative to watch. You will find the host Mr. Mike Rowe&#8217;s comments very entertaining. Mike has gone to some extraordinary lengths to participate in these series and show us an array of episodes how hard some honest people work in this country to make our lives easier. If these honest people did not do their dirty jobs as portrayed in the series then civilized life on earth would not have been possible. Sincere thanks to all hardworking individuals who made these series a hit.	0
Shame on you if you ever look at an old person again and don't remember they were once young and had the world by the tail.Jacob is now ninety or ninety-three, he can't remember, and is living out his last years in a nursing home treated as belligerent and cantankerous.He sits a lot and while he sits, recalls his life in the circus.  It is an amazing and fantastic story. And so I don't write a spoiler I will simply say, I couldn't put the book down!	5
"""Boy, Did I Get a Wrong Number"" is my favorite Bob Hope film. I have loved this movie since I was a child, and now MY kids watch it over and over. Phyllis Diller on a motorcycle is a sight to see! Just give it a chance....it's a great lighthearted, fun movie that isn't the usual Hollywood ""dirty word and perversion"" fest. There is some mild innuendo going on, but it's tame compared to what is on modern ""family"" shows these days."	0
The special features on this newest digitally remastered dvd are not listed on Amazon or the box. For those interested you get the Fame and Fortune song as an extra, but not part of the film. There is also the Destiny's Child music video, Regis Philbin music video, a Rudolph trivia game, original tv promo, plus spanish/french language options and subtitles. Don't watch this on TV as they cut parts out for more commercials. Watch it fully uncut on dvd as it was meant to be seen! It's worth the purchase.	15
I love this charger for my Sony z550a. I can charge my phone, and use the pass through to listen to MP3s playing from my phone on the car stereo.My only complain is the bright green LED that is on the end of the charger (to show that it's plugged in). At night, this LED lights up the car's cabin and since my power is on the console, it shines directly in my eyes. I've had to place a small piece of black electrical tape over the light to dim it. Standard hole-punch made a perfect circle shaped mask.	7
I have used these through one Missouri winter and I don't see how you can slip with these on ice or snow. Held up great. A life saver literally. My brother in law slipped on the ice and he has had 3 back surgeries and is disabled. I saw these on Amazon and I got them the first chance I got after seeing he's horrible luck, Slip on and off easy when you need them to. Otherwise stay on tight for me.  I got the medium's. Size 10.5 to 11 Mens for me.	8
First do not let the name fool you, yes there are strippers and some nudity, but no more than in the average horror flick.  This movie if HILARIOUS!  The political satire is utterly priceless and I thought the cast was lots of fun.  You KNOW they had a ball doing this, it shows.  This has quickly become one of my favorite Zombie/Comedy classics.  Sure, there are some continuity problems, but so what?  It is so much fun who cares!  Take a chance on this little known gem, you won't be disappointed!!	0
This stuff sincerely makes magic happen!  I had removed some vinyl decals from a boat that was several years old and even after Using Goo Gone and scrubbing thoroughly with soap and water, the &#34;ghosting&#34; of the vinyl letters could still be seen.  I purchased this oxidation remover and not only did it successfully remove 100% of the ghosting but it works so well that I went ahead and shined up all area's of my boat's gel coat!  This stuff is incredible and brings new life to an older boat!	20
Critics trashed this album when it came out.  Too polished, overproduced, not like down and dirty.........blah blah blah.This is a great album that showcases their growth and success.  Everybody really does a good job on this album.  This second album has more great songs than their third Album &quot;money and muscle, and better performances, and more mature than Down and Dirty.  Definite satisfaction.Take the down and dirty album and add about million dollars worth of production value and you get this album.  The group probably won't make a fourth album so this is the one everyone will remember.	9
These headphones are really great, unfortunately mine broke early on. The return policy calls for you to ship the items back to Koss + $9.00 shipping and handling. I stood up and literally tore the cables out. In my own defense, they're not secured in tightly. I still give the headphones four stars because I believe they're stylish and the sound is really great. They really fit a comfortable niche for those that do not want sound-isolation; and, they have a really strong ability to throw sounds and convince you that you have more than two sound channels.	10
If you are like me, you're wanting to read the book before the movie comes out in a few weeks.  I've heard about this book for months, but I never could bring myself to buy it.  A favorite actor of mine is in the movie, so I finally decided to read it.  I am sorry I waited so long to do so!  It's one of the best books I've ever read.  The author's words are so well-written and descriptive, they paint pictures in your mind.  GET THIS BOOK if you want a heart-warming, and at times, thrilling read!	5
I have ordered this pack for the first time, and as usual, HP has come through once again. The price is one of the best as I've compared to purchasing in different office supply stores. The quality is top notch. I have no complaints. Thus far, I've already used about 50 pages & it was recently delivered. The colors are bright & no paper jams noted on my 2 printers. When I find a product this good, I will order again-and-again. Totally satisfied. Highly recommended!	17
Tweetcaster has more features, but Seesmic was enough. I liked that Seesmic didn't ask for access to low level system log files (like Tweetcaster does) but disliked that it wanted my GPS data. Seesmic has a nice refresh button. It is hard to tell when something has been retweeted, and by whom. FB integration did not work for this Kindle Fire user, either. I would also have liked the ability to use a darker theme. I am keeping Seesmic and not Tweetcaster mostly for the data access issue.	1
This is some of the best metal polish paste I've ever used. Even though it isn't explicitly stated in the description, it does work on other surfaces if care is taken. For example, I polished and buffed the tinted windscreen for a vintage Japanese motorcycle I am restoring. Took off all the dirt and allowed it to be polished and buffed. Looks much better than it previously did. Works on any household metals like tea kettles, stainless steel sinks, silverware, etc. Can't go wrong and the price is right.	2
this fits my elongated toilet which the padded cartoon character seats will not. It's easy to clean too - there are no crevices like the padded seat. The splashguard doesn't really do much for boys and because of it, my son can't keep his legs close together like he can on the mini toilets in his daycare, so he has to be very conscious to not spray when he pees.I think it's a bit bulky for travelling. we have a folding potty seat that we bring with us for travelling.	3
I have been using this baby tracker for three months and it has been very useful.  My little one had feeding issues and it was necessary to explain his habits and behavior to the pediatrician and several lactation consultants.  His feeding issues also contributed to sleep issues, which I was also able to track in the journal.  After weeks of sleep deprivation, the Dark Period, I could easily respond to the pediatrician's questions by referring to entries in the baby tracker.It's nice to look back at the Dark Period and see how far we've come.	3
If you are only going to be pumping once in a blue moon, then this is a great pump for you.  I found it to be an incredible nusance, so I borrowed a friend's Medela electric pump.  Never used this Back to Work pump more than twice after using hers!  Why spend a longer amount of time pumping that you have to (and yes it does take longer even though the manual says their stats say otherwise).  With our next child, I will definitely be buying electric!	3
Beautiful Advent calendar, but the pictures show the kid pressing a button to play sound/music. The actual product doesn't have any sound. $45 was way too much for this product, but it's one of the few Advent calendars that show the true meaning of Christmas, so I'm keeping it. It loses a star because of the pictures showing a different version of the product you get. I can see it being a beautiful Christmas tradition in my house for years to come (too bad about the lack of sound, though! My two-year old would have loved that.)	22
"I LOVE THIS VACUUM, it's 100% perfect for apartments or quick spot vacuuming in homes. Eureka has a winner on it's hands. I especially LOVE the old ""tank"" design as opposed to the current square ""canister"" design all vacuums companies are now using. Look no further in it's price range THIS IS the best on the market. So many pluses  but just to name a few...extra long cord, massive suction, long hose.I only have 1 negative comment:When vacuuming you are restricted to back and forth straight line vacuuming and I could see how this would be an issue for some."	13
I'm a typical guy that is basically clueless about jewelry, but I can certainly appreciate the ease of buying something on Amazon as opposed to going to a jewelry store and dealing with salespeople trying to push expensive products. My favorite move is when they take out their calculator and magically apply some unknown discount to what may or may not be a sticker price. My wife absolutely loved these earings - I don't know exactly why - but if your loved one is asking for gold hoop earrings these are the real deal.	8
"I'm disappointed as the title said ""rapid"" charger and its definitely not that. I use my Samsung Galaxy S III in the car for navigation (duh). I was hoping keeping it plugged to this charger will, at the very least, MAINTAIN the level of charge that I had when I got into the car, even if not charge it up fully as I drive. No such luck. My charge kept going down. I had to switch the screen off so the charger could charge the phone up  a bit so it wouldn't go completely dead."	7
This is a substantial, yet almost invisible pot holder. Come to think of it, though, I have a light pot and plant in it; if I had this attached to a railing on a second story or higher railing, I would think twice about placing a heavy pot in it for fear that it might break and fall. I like it fine on our first floor railing.The nuts to adjust the holder could be better. I would suggest using stainless steel wing nuts--or even plastic with brass thread insert knobs--to replace the acorn nuts. Even with those changes, this is still a reasonably-priced plant pot holder.	18
Im all for low budget, b-movies but this one didn't even seem to try. Acting is poor. The sound and sound mixing is terrible. The premise is good but the execution couldn't have been worse. With zombies ALL AROUND YOU, how is it that these characters never paid attention to their surroundings and were constantly caught off guard&#8230; Theres a certain level of stupidity portrayed in these movies that's forgivable and tolerable but this movie takes the cake&#8230; can I give a rating lower than one please?	0
This lotion has a great scent (peppermint and plum), and also invigorates your skin.  Peppermint has the botanical property of cooling hot skin, and this lotion definitely gets the job done.  It's also great for your legs, after you've just come out the of shower.  Be sure to use Freeman's Foot Soak, the Freeman Exfoliant (I reccomend you stick to the same scent as the lotion), and then follow with the Bare Foot Softening Lotion.  This stuff is great.	12
I purchased these shoes for my husband who was opposed to wearing them initially.  After some coaxing, he raved about the comfort and is a Sperry convert.  Unfortunately, after wearing less than a week, they began to fall apart.  I returned them and ordered a new pair which were a size larger than they should have been despite being marked a 9.5.  Sooo, I returned them again.  This time, we'll buy in person as Amazon cannot be trusted to deliver a quality product that is sized correctly.	8
This a second generation e-reader. By adding a 16 GB micro SD card, it can store more e-books than I'll ever own. Most of my books are in PDF format. It has trouble displaying charts or images and fails totally to display an e-book in PDF form that I bought from Forbes.com. All these books display properly in PDF readers available on personal computers.It's other weakness is that it has minimal documentation. The topics are covered but the explanaitons leave the user with a lot of questions.	10
I'm not quite sure how to review these dividers.  They're what you'd expect.  They... divide.  They seem durable, the punched holes are reinforced, the tabs are a good size to be clearly visible, and they come with extra tab inserts in case you can't make up your mind between &#34;Expenses&#34; and &#34;Outgoing.&#34;They will do the job, little troopers that they are.  It's true they're not flashy or showy, but sometimes the homey virtues are the best.	17
Have you looked at the shelves in the local grocery store to see how many different &#34;hot sauses&#34; are available. Then in some specialty stores there are even more. I decided to try a couple of bottle other than Tabasco. That was a mistake. There is nothing like the real Tabasco Original Sause. I have poured those two bottles out and will be sticking to Tabasco. In the long run it cost just a fraction more than some of those really cheap bottles I purchased and the taste ---well there is no comparison.	11
The Skagen 233LTTN men's watch is good-looking and so thin that you barely notice it under a dress shirt cuff.  The band is easy to adjust and of course it keeps great time.  I bought one of the &#34;in&#34; big, clunky watches and had to give it up because it was just too uncomfortable to wear under a shirt and suit jacket.  The Skagen is a dream - as comfortable as the old Universal-Geneve I used to own and just as handsome.  This is a great watch!	8
I'm a big fan of Rush.....and this is a decent album.  However....i am REALLY getting annoyed with digital compressed recordings!  Younger folks will not understand my ramblings on this issue.....but if you grew up on analog recordings of your favorite music....you KNOW how much better it sounds. ALL music these days has the same compressed sound!  Go back and listen to your older recordings of Rush and Van Halen....or ANY other band from the analog era.  It sounds SO much more open and dynamic.	6
Overall has most of my favorite episodes. It's hard to explain, but there is something about the cast of characters and how they interact that is very believeable despite the unreal events they cope with. The acting is sincere, and we know the foibles and quirks of the characters which makes the epidsodes more fun. I think I like &#34;Insane in the P Brane&#34; best of all.  The two scientists on either side of a scientific breakthrough, unknown to them, but one thinks he's hearing his mother from the after life is done very well. I miss my Eureka &#34;friends&#34;.	0
If this app came on your phone only your carrier can decide if you can remove it or not. Sprint did not preload this app on my phone. I chose to download and use it. I found I could move the app to the SD card on my phone. It works just fine there. I play music stored on my SD card far more than the stuff on my cloud drive. I like this app. I don't like reviews that rate apps down for issues caused by choices made by carriers.	1
After hearing about how my relatives in Missouri deal with their raccoon problems (usually involving a rifle), I decided that killing those pesky critters probably wasn't the nicest way to deal with them just doing what they naturally do, so I always wanted to try one of these traps instead.  You can very easily catch any small animal in here, and then release them miles away from your house where they can live a happy life away from your yard.  It's a quick and humane way to take care of your animal issues once and for all.	18
I first bought this Olay moisturizer cream because it's unscented.  (Hurrah, if I want perfume, I prefer what I use!)  I've been very happy with it ever since. It's not messy, is easy to apply and has sunscreen in it.  If you wear make-up it'll go over the moisturizer with no problem. The anti-aging must work as I get a lot of comments that I don't look my age! (85) I don't wear make-up except for eyes and mouth, so what people see is what's there, wrinkles and all.Recommend highly.	4
Took this to Hawaii so I could keep my stuff safe while in the water.  It would only fit either my cell phone or my camera, not both (plus some cash, credit cards, keys, coins, etc). My cell phone is small (smaller than iphone), and normal size point-and-shoot camera.  The strap is very uncomfortable though when u go underwater (for a long time, like snorkeling)... the whole thing spins and squeezes your wrist...and it hurts. Other than that, it kept everything dry the whole time.	7
"Even with the advent of the PS2/3, the original ""Resident Evil"" still holds its water against the modern era of video games.  It set the standard for ""survival horror"" in video games.  It frightens and delights.  The controls take a little to get down, and the intensity and urgency of the game demand that you get those under control or be eaten.The game takes time and is recommended for those that can devote 30min-1hour a day to the game.A must for any game who claims to be a fan of the zombie genre."	23
I just got this headset from Best Buy. I paid a little extra there because of the counterfeit scare in the online world! However, I just love the sound. Specially the bass. Most of the ear-bud style headphones suck at reproducing bass. My T-Mobile MDA has paired up perfectly. The A2DP and the volume/play/pause/mute work like charm. I would give it a 5 star but it's a little bulky for the gym. The cloth interior of the speakers will not stand the sweat for long. The shocks at the treadmill are yet to be tried out.	7
The first time I played the game with 2 other players, who both thought they were smarter than me and laughed at me when I asked questions on how they interpreted the rules.  One of my opponents had played the game prior to our &#34;match&#34; on more than one occasion.  It turned out, I had interpreted the rules correctly and missed many opportunities to play the way I should have been &#34;allowed&#34; to play, but I still beat the other two players.  I would play every day if I could.  Great game for mental stimulation, motor skills, strategy, etc.	22
They are so quick and efficient.  When my last cooker warped I asked for a replacement for Christmas - yep, that's how much I love them.  My last pressure cooker was also a pressure caner for putting up vegetables.  However we are down to just my husband and I so we don't do much canning any more.  So he bought me this smaller version.  Obviously it weighs less, takes up less room in my cupboard, and comes to heat much quicker.  What isn't to love if you are cooking for only two people as we care!	13
I liked moments of Tenebre.  I liked some of the well photographed individual shots, like the straight razor killing the light bulb, and the ending was indeed effective. However, I thought that the rock music detracted a lot from the film and unfortunately I saw it in the dubbed version which really took away a lot of the film's effectiveness, I think.  Way too many killer POV shots as well.  Effective scenes marred by okay pacing, bad music, shaky narrative make Tenebre a film that makes me want to see more Argento, but not this one again.	15
I was glad to see this game offered for free on Amazon. I had the free version, ad supported, and ended up uninstalling it. The ads were just way to annoying trying to play, other than that I loved this game. It's very challenging, and forcing you to focus on eye-hand control. It does get frustrating as you move up through the levels, but not enough that it isn't addicting. If you like puzzle games this is a fun game! Also works great on my HTC Evo 3g.	1
This purse is very likeable.  It's a handy, small size and the leather is quite soft to touch.  The drawback is that the gap at the top when the purse is clasped is so large little items may fall out.  With the price of lipstick these days, I won't chance carrying it loose in this purse!  I did keep the purse, though, thinking I can use it for special occasions when it suits my outfit.  On those occasions, I plan to put the smaller items in a cosmetic bag and carry that inside the purse.	8
This has been my favorite tape for years...which is why we probably call &#34;tape&#34;, &#34;scotch tape&#34;!It simply is better then the others in my opinion. It feels better, it doesn't yellow, it is very easy to wrap presents with, it is almost invisible, you can write on it, and probably thousands of other things.Does it cost a few cents more? Maybe, but it is the quality you are paying for. :)Plus, I am use use to saying &#34;can You tell me where the scotch tape is please&#34;?	17
"These are 3mm pouches and are a good value for 25 at this size.  I used them to make custom placemats for my 4yo daughter to give as birthday and other small gifts to family members.  She draws a picture and we laminate it.  Pretty easy.  Keep in mind that these are 3mm - which is clearly indicated in the listing - but that 3mm is very thin.  I wish I had purchased a thicker one for our purpose.  Also be sure that your laminator can take an 11.5"" wide pouch."	17
The late Robert Ginty, R.I.P., lays down some rough road in this one, though the guy on the cover aint him! This is a NY picture, like Street Trash, Ms. .45, The Wanderers, The Warriors, The Lords Of Flatbush, The taking Of Pelham 1,2,3, (the original 70s version with Walter Matthau, Robert Shaw, and Simon Oakland, not the unneccessary '00s remake!), et al. And like all good made-in-New York movies, you know eventually somebody's gonna be handed their ass!! This is no exception. Be prepared to suffer. You have been warned! The sickness with the quickness!!	15
This is a great tool for the price . One of my guys bought one. It drills pretty well in any material. Except masonry. It's not so fast that you burn your bits in steel. The torque is quite impressive . More than my Milwaukee  Magnum. You could easily hurt yourself with this bad boy. But that means  you can use some pretty large bits and hole saws with it. Some times when  all your batteries are dead (if you forget to charge them) you need a  corded drill just to remember how nice the cordless one are.	21
I've had my PortaPros for several years now, and they've served me very, very well.Pros:- Best sound I've heard in a small portable headphone. (My Grado SR-80s sound better, but there's no way you'd walk down the street in 'em)- Fold reasonably well into a coat-pocketable clump- Durable as heck (other than the replaceable foam earpiece covers).  I use the heck out of these, and they take it in stride.Cons:- Look pretty un-cool.- Foam earpiece covers need replacing every 50 or so uses - cheap and readily-available from Koss, takes a minute to do.	10
An absolute amazing entry into the Jack Ryan universe. This novel provides the back story of the mysterious character of John Kelly A.K.A. Mr. Clark. The events take you on a two fold journey. One a revenge trip John takes on the local pimps and drug dealers who attacked him and killed his girl. While doing this he also plans and executes a Special Ops mission into Vietnam to rescue an American P.O.W. The action is intense and keeps moving at a steady pace through out. If you are new to Tom Clancy, this book is a great place to start.	5
I have one of these,  everyone in the sprint store was using them and suggested it to me,  and it's the best headset I've found to date.  It cancels noise out just fine, and I hear very well.  On occasion if I'm on speakerphone and someone else on this headset model or vice versatile then there's some slight choppiness but,  for the most part it's the best headset imve encountered so far.  I'd suggest this headset to anyone.  Just be careful with the. Earpiece. It's delicate.  I know a few people who have broken theirs,	7
These are so easy. I don't have to wash a million bottles anymore! I just have to wash the nipples. The only complaint I have is that I pre-fill with water and dump in the formula when I'm ready, but when I put in the 8 oz. and let the bottle sit for a while, the bag expands a little so it only looks like I have 7 oz. So the measurements may be a little off. I would use a measuring cup to make sure you get exactly how much water you want and not rely on the liner's measurements.	3
This item has been a life saver for me!  Not only does my child love it but it's the only thing I can distract him with while dressing him (he apparently HATES putting sweaters on). I can hit one of the sides and instantly get flashing lights and music while I try to squeeze a sweater over my child's head. My child loves it because it's easy for him to hit and acheive the same flashing lights and music.  The music is good and there are a lot of different choices.	3
Awesome pick up power for pet hair.  Does an excellent job cleaning carpets.  I would have given it 5 stars but it overheated on the 3rd use.  I e-mailed hoover and they said to make sure  all filters are clean. I discover a filter above the dirt canister and it was clogged.  The new routine is to check that filter when dumping the canister. No overheat problems with a clean filter. The Hoover folks said that the motor needs lots of air flow to keep it cool. Really impressed with how much dirt it removes from the carpet.	13
This was the first effort by Mr. Skinner. It's a very simple, lovingly, sweet story about 2 lost souls that find each other. Their union brings a stability and happiness that each have lost. Brock's life is rocked by scandal and Carey's life is rocked by loss. Carey extends a hand of friendship to a disillusioned Brock.Having read &#34;Memorizing You&#34;, Mr. Skinner's second effort, I can see great leaps in his story telling,but don't let that deter you from reading this. It's just what you need for a summer read.	14
My Cherie Amour is another solid late 60's album from Stevie Wonder.  The title cut is one of the best ballads he's ever done.  It has lush orchestration and a supple vocal.  Many of the other songs are in this vein including &quot;Hello Young Lovers&quot;, &quot;You &amp; Me&quot;, &quot;Somebody Knows, Somebody Cares&quot; and &quot;At Last&quot;.  &quot;Yester-Me, Yester-You, Yesterday&quot; has a great vocal and &quot;Light My Fire&quot; is based on the Jose Feliciano version not The Doors'.	9
Of the two Edie Brickell and the New Bohemians (EBATNB) cds, 1988's  Shooting Rubberbands at the Stars (SRATS) is better than 1990's Ghost of a  Dog or Edie's 1994 solo effort. On SRATS, there are 12 consistent and  original songs with Edie's breathy vocals complimenting each one. The  music, lyrics and vocals are what make this a stand out cd. Sometimes the  first cd is the best from an artist and that would be accurate to say here.  It has the hits &quot;What I Am&quot; and &quot;Circle&quot; plus 8 other  tracks that are just as good. A must have for any rock collector.	9
I have been a photographer for over 45 years and am very familiar with the quality of Nikon's optics. However, I own both the Nikon 10x25 and the Bushnell 12x25 binoculars and in terms of clarity I find no discernible difference between the two, except the Bushnell has a bit more power. The Bushnell's are also much smaller than the Nikon so they take up less space when you are packing for a trip. Considering they cost $30 less than Nikon's, and are stronger, the choice is clear...buy the Bushnell every time. A great pair of small binoculars.	20
Too loud. Too hard. Buttons don't depress easily or distinctly. My 6 month old has fallen headfirst onto the cube and has cut her forehead and chin and jaw on the hard(!) unpadded edges. The corners have sufficient covers but why not the edges between corners??? Buttons require too much strength to push for a 6 month old. She can sometimes manage it her feet if cube is braced against other object. Definitely NOT for under 1 year olds. Battery replacement requires screwdriver.Munchkin Mozart Magic Cube	3
I can't find this dye anywhere, firstly. Secondly. IF you're like me and you have dark, dark, brown hair, maybe you should look elsewhere. I actually came to this shade because I wanted a reddish tent to my hair.Anyway, this stuff actually shimmers, though my hair is no where near copper it is shimmering. I actually had shiny stuff all over my pillow for a week, so, just a heads up. I love the results I got. I closer to a copper chestnut than a sultry copper, but, like I said, copper was never my intention.	4
When I first saw Super Mario 64 in 1996 I had to pick my jaw up off the ground.  While 10 years have passed, I still consider this game of the finest pieces of entertainment I have ever seen.  The kinds of things that the development team pulled off in the mid 90s set the stage for all future video game development and it was, is and always will be groundbreaking.An achievement that should not be ignored and is still as much fun today as it was a decade (DECADE?!!?) ago.***** HIGHEST POSSIBLE RECOMMENDATION	23
Excellent product but a little pricy, relatively speaking.If you own a rotary shaver, then you're going to have to get new blades at some point.  The high cost of these replacement blades makes me second-guess my decision to purchase a rotary shaver, to begin with!Oh well...I'm stuck having to continue buying these blades, unless somebody develops a means with which to effectively sharpen the old blades. I just can't bring myself to throw away my ($$$) rotary shaver. That thing cost me a hundred bucks!	12
I bought this together with a thumb sucking guard. Let's just say that the combination worked wonders on my 3 year old!He's no longer sucking his thumb. He did throw up twice and he is a picky eater so I wasn't so happy about it. But I'd rather he lost appetite for a couple of days than having him suck on his thumb on his wedding night! jajaja!Anyhow, I have a lot of this remaining so I will give it to another child sufferer.It does work wonders for kids.	4
At first, I didn't know what to expect from this book.  I thought it would be your typical survivor story but I was so wrong.  This is a book that had me sad one minute and cheering the next.  I'm not going to lie, at times it was hard to read--this is a very heavy subject. There were some very intense scenes that shocked me, especially because they really happened.  It's so hard to imagine living a life like this.  I wish it is was a work fiction and that this wasn't a real part of our history.	14
I am SO relieved the Economist is now available on Kindle.  I was having to go through the hassle of printing pages as pdfs and then converting them every week.  I honestly have no problem with the price being the same as the print version.  I pay for the quality of the reporting and analysis when I subscribe to a journal or newspaper.  The fact that it is on Kindle simply adds to the convenience for me, so I feel pricing it the same is fair value as far as I am concerned.  Thank you, thank you, thank you!  My life is now complete...	14
This is a good USB cable.  It is compatible with both USB 1.0 and 2.0 ports.  It is long enough to give great flexibility with arraging whatever it needs to be connected to.  The price is extremely good (even though amazon.com changes it every now and then) for this cable.  It is way more expensive in stores.  And getting a Belkin product for such a low price is excellent.  This is totally worth the money, and is a great buy if you need a USB cable.	10
Silent Hill in space and just about as annoying. I understand the tension that the developers were trying to create and they succeed but this is ridiculous.  Constantly low on ammo with weapons so defective the manufacturers would be promptly put out of business all the while being attacked by hordes of wrench wielding, regenerating zombies.  You aint gotta chance and thank heavens for cheats or I wouldn't be bothered.  If you could get it for under 10 bucks go for it and kill some time.  But I sure wouldn't spend the money that is being demanded on Amazon.	23
I've had this thing for years now, and use it all the time. At one point I went to plug my USB cord in without looking and totally smashed the internal stuff up inside the top! I thought it was broken, however after finding something small to push the innerds back down to where the cord would once again fit inside, it's worked just fine. Never cuts out or anything. I still have to be careful, otherwise I'll push the internal casing back upwards - I'm sure I broke some little stabilizer - but I can get it back down easily. I'm impressed.	7
I don't see what the big fuss is about these. I gave these a try since I was sucked in by all these 5 star reviews and expected something mind-blowing. Sadly, I was dissapointed.  The elastic waistband is way too thick and stiff. I can feel it digging into my stomach and sides when I sit down. The legs do not have any elastic so the ride up and bunch. For the price these are not worth it. I would rather spend more money and get something more comfortable like Under Armour's boxers.	8
I was very disappointed in this product. It was highly recommended by the hospital, so I bought TWO sets of these bottles before my baby was born. After breastfeeding for about four or more weeks, I tried to get her to take a bottle and she refused the Medela nipple. We also tried the Avent nipple and she didn't like those, either. We finally ended up with the Playtex Premium. She only needed a small amount of coaxing to take those. Now she's a pro! (Anyone need my Medela set????)	3
Love this - just what I was looking for.  It cuts well (the edges are serrated), and it has the weight & rigidity you want when dishing out a slice of pie.  Very happy with it.November 2012 Update:  This server is still going strong, 5 years later (and many times through the dishwasher), and it was just top-rated AGAIN by the folks at Cook's Illustrated!  Can't go wrong with this server, and at such a good price, too.	13
These blades do look slightly more attractive than the framed OEMs on my 2006 Scion tC, but their performance is not as good. In the summer they work fine, but once the weather dips below 50, the larger blade starts to streak. I'm assuming that because it is a fairly large blade (26 inches on the tC) the factory mechanism isn't strong enough to push it down. Now that the weather is getting cold again (already snowed twice and it's only October) I will be looking for OEM refills. They are made by a company called NWB.	2
I can't believe Outkast only now is getting recognized because of Speakkerbox/The Love Below. I mean recognized by winning awards, producing other peoples songs, and even becoming movie stars. But this is their true masterpiece in my eyes. Nothing really poppy, straight hard core rap. Favorites are as follow: Two Dope Boyz (In A Cadillac), ATLiens, Wheelz Of Steel, Jazzy Belle, Elevators (Me & You),  Babylon, Mainstream, and E.T. (Extraterrestrial). True Hip Hop Classic. Get this and their other albums before SB/TLB.	9
I am sure this cable works fantastically.As long as it is used with the correct phone. I should have know better, but the price was so incredibly low- especailly having originally purchased the correct cable from Nokia 2 years ago for fifty bucks- that I felt, even if my phone was not listed, hey, it could still work, right?Wrong. But in an effort to write a 'helpful' review I have to add, it is in fact an OEM Nokia CA-52 cable, it was very inexpensive, and it arrived much sooner than expected.	7
Anything I've read by Gibran is, in my mind, flawless. This, the most famous of his works, is no exception. It is simple, yet deep; honest and profound; moving and inspirational. Gibran's work is one of a kind, and can be far more encouraging and moving than any self-help program or therapy or anything like that. The poetic style, the aphorisms, the parables, the almost biblical feel, are all just what over-worked, over-stressed, modern and spiritually starved worldly people need.	5
So I bought this thinking it would be great and it is, kinda. I hooked it up and it sounded like someone was making soup. It bubbles and it's pretty loud. My male betta didn't like the water movement so I just took the carbon and stuff out of it and put it in one of my Tetra filters. The noise made me do it.  Ps. If you do but this, rinse the cartridge very well with cold water! other wise it will cloud the tank because of the carbon.	19
It is convenient and packs up well for car camping.  The stove gets very hot, and is great for boiling water.The stove does not do 'simmer' particularly well.  Be careful with anything that needs lower heat settings.  Using a cast iron pan or high quality aluminum or copper clad pan helps.  Attempting pancakes, eggs or a side dish requires very close attention.I would say that overall this is a good value, but there are better units available.It does have good wind resistance to it, which is a definite plus outside.	20
You can't beat these tools in ease of replacing tie rod ends.  I haven't tried the pitman arm puller or the ball joint tool yet, but if they're anything like the tie rod tools, they'll make your life way easier.  Don't mess around with those pickle stabbers, get a real set of tools and make your life easier.  They're beefy enough to work on everything the &#34;home mechanic&#34; can throw at them, and it's really refreshing when you can take a tie rod end off with barely a twist of a wrench.  They come in a nice case too!	2
My daughter and I each took a bite of this bar -- and one bite was enough.  With the consistency of taffy, this bar has got 24 grams of sugar.  It's like taking a heaping tablespoon of sugar along with your vitamins.  Ugh.Note for celiacs:  Not a gluten-free food.  Although the ingredients list no wheat or gluten, it is processed on equipment that also processes wheat. Also contains nuts, milk, and soy.  And sugar. Lots and lots of sugar.	12
"Used this with a Panasonic 22 inch LCD. Very durable and works as advertised.It was advertised as fitting 22""-37"" televisions, but the size of the t.v mounting plate is so large that it covers some of the plug connections on the back of the television. I will have to cut the metal plate to get to the P.C connector if i choose to connect a computer.Haven't decided if i will keep or send back to get something with a smaller mounting plate.Other than that, it's a great product and meets my need for a hanging television."	10
Joseph is the ideal role model for EVERY Christian/Jew. He is an example of what we should strive for. Waiting for a spouse to have sex. Sticking to your God no matter the outcome. This movie reflects all of that perfectly. The actors did a great job. When I first saw this years ago I was blown away by the quality!! That was back in the VHS days...cant wait to see it on DVD. So I cant speak for the transfer quality yet, sorry.	15
I've been taking this tea on and off for the past 6 months. If I don't take this tea I'm irritable, have severe mood swings, cramps and sometimes even fever during the days leading up to my cycle. Taking this tea daily 1 1/2 weeks before my scheduled time eliminates the moods, the headache/fever, the cramps, everything! It also helps in the cleansing process itself. No side effects and no harm to your system make this tea a MUST. I'm buying another box :)	11
Only every once and a while does a rap masterpiece like this come out (i.e. Biggies &quot;Ready To Die&quot;, Eazy E's &quot;It's on 187um killer etc.). This album was Tupac's first with Death Row and he did not dissapoint with songs to get you're head moving, or your brain thinking he did it all on two discs of pure west coast goodness. And I know this is going to get me alot of negative votes but...please let the man R.I.P., no more of these ... &quot;hes alive&quot; theories, he's gone and you have to accept it,sorry.	9
I got a great deal on this used PS1 game. My girlfriend plays this classic game and enjoys it a lot. She's not much of a gamer. The disc seems to be in great condition with no scratches and plays perfectly. There's a few tiny &#34;cracks&#34; within the inner ring of the disc, but this is common and DOES NOT affect the actual disc itself. It seems like an alright game to me, just not my style, which is why I gave it a 4/5. But a lot of people seem to like this game. It's a great kids game as well.	23
I purchased this as a stop gap replacement for the original hook on my pneumatic coil nailer.  It worked, but it was awkward to get the nail gun on and off the hook due to the need to feed the hook between the coil and handle of the gun, and it's tendency to want to spin rather than come off.  The yellow hook portion swivels where it connects to the belt clip.  It was a little disappointing.I've since used it for carrying my dewalt cordless tools around and it's much better for that.	21
Quick Overview: Jake returns to the town of Jericho to work out some money matters with his father. He makes a speedy exit that is halted abruptly when a ginormous explosion rocks Jericho. Now the whole population is cut off from everything.  Secrets and such come out as these citizens ban together to survive.Great plot. Viewers learn a lot about all of the characters and their histories as they maneuver this big scale event. It didn't take me long to get into the swing on things. The cast does a remarkable job working together and delivering believable dialogue.	0
"We're dinosaurs that still have come cassette tapes we like to listen to (and good luck finding a cheapo deck to use with a higher end stereo system)  This little gem combines a single cd with cassette.  I like the auto repeat function.  The size and price and combo unit had great appeal.  Never used the remote, so don't know.  Easy to ""install"" and use right away - no complex hookup needed.  I don't have any complaints about the sound quality or functionality of this unit."	10
This tripod is too short (I virtually always use it extended to full height, including the head), too flimsy (it struggles to hold my Canon 400D still, even with a small lens), and difficult to adjust (the same camera is virtually impossible to hold at much of an angle).  The removable head is also a bit flimsy.  However, it's also light, and ridiculously cheap.  Don't pay more than $15 for it, and you won't be disappointed.	10
My husband loved these when he first put them on and continued to love them - except that after they were washed, they turned a funny color. They are no longer brown. Instead they look like they were washed with something that bled into the brown threads and I guess it was the dark fleece lining that did it...because the pants were washed alone. They are still wearable. They just look a little odd now. But for around the house and yard, walking dogs, hunting - they'll be fine.	8
"We have been using this system for about two months now.  We have 2.5 walls in what was once our dining room (now play room).  We used 4-5 extensions as well.  We bought this new, and it was easy to set up.  Be sure you install it into the studs - infants will pull up on the railing.  Kidco is pretty easy to work with.  They sent me free ""templates"" for the wall and I bought some screws (for another gate).I LOVE this system.  The quality is great.  I recommend it and would purchase another if needed."	3
I was able to pick up my local police, fire, and ambulance.I always wanted to buy a real one of these, but they arevery hard to find anymore... plus, online, they are very expensive.So, this app is awesome!!!!!  I don't listen to it nearly enough.We always have tons of sirens going everywhere and alwayscurious as to what happened, but I don't use this that often.If I did, I know that I would satisfy my curiosity.	1
This show is cute.  My daughter loved it when she was 1 to 3 years old and still asks for it occasionally now at 5.5.  The characters are cute.  Most kids adore animals of any kind and there are plenty with cute rescues...only thing for parents is the singing can be kind of annoying sometimes.  Just  let it in though.  Eeventually you'll be humming and singing the theme song all the time...or it will just play on a continuous reel in your mind while you're trying to fall asleep or typing a review on amazon!  That's the only catch.	0
This is an excellent-sounding pickup.  I've had it for about six years.  Good sound throughout the spectrum - full lows and bright highs, without too much emphasis on either.  At the price it sells for, I consider it a bargain.The drawbacks:1) You need to be pay attention when installing and removing - you can damage the sound hole on your guitar if you're not careful.2) No volume control.If you're looking to occasionally amplify an acoustic guitar, this is a great, cost-effective way to go.	16
We already own one of these, and when the Vine Program offered this I got another.  Over the last six years we've caught at least a dozen groundhogs as well as several skunks and cats and a raccoon.  My husband camouflages the trap with pine branches, spreads out some enticing food (apple, tuna--depending on what we're trying to catch) around & inside the trap, and without fail we get our uninvited animal.  Now we have one to loan out and one to use.  Recommend this product!!	18
I've used test strips before but wanted a more accurate test after redesigning my tank. Everywhere I looked on the internet people recommended this testing kit. I was happy to find this test kit cheaper than local fish or pet stores. Nothing was broken or leaking when I opened it and the test tubes seem fairly durable. The kit was really straightforward on how to test the water and each bottle is labeled with the number of drops needed. The laminated color card is really nice since its constantly by water and getting wet. Overall I'm really happy with this kit.	19
Perfect. Fits my large phone with its large extended battery. Along with my wallet, house key, and some cash. I'm also able to attach my tactical Recon 1 Tonto folder from Cold Steel to the side, very* securely. I'm very pleased. I think I may start seeing if I can get away with carry my Roger LCP in this. It fits, and it's comfortable. Why not.This thing is also water proof so if you are a woman who considers carrying concealed on the trails in case an attack happens, your gun will stay dry. Or phone....lol. it's versatile ;)	20
This is it! the best game of all time even ff8 can't stand over this game I did not like rpg's tell I played this game there is no reason not to buy it...well you might lose you'r job get kicked out of school lose you'r boy/girlfriend because you will do nothing but play this game! and belive me or not I stayed up for a full week to play this game with only a 15 min brake every 5 hrs! and I had my parants get me homeschool just so I could play this game more!!! no I'm not lieing! BUY THE GAME!!!	23
yes, this is a sad and eerie record . i must admit that i prefer the first two nick drake albums, but this is a fine album in its own right. my favorite songs are things behind the sun and parasite. know is also excellent, a weird  little blues cut with ominous and powerful strumming by drake and  a few deceptively simple words. a majestic and rather creepy release from perhaps the greatest of the late 60's early 70s singer songwriters. and as always, his voice, arrangements and words are eerie,haunting ,and touching. highly recommended.	9
I have a condition which makes my arms itch intensly and nothing, I mean nothing has worked. Finally, I have found something that helps! This lotion really does the trick as it has Calamine (3%) and Pramoxine HCl (1%) in it which seems to be the key.  The calamine lotion does make the application appear a bit pink but rubbing it in well disguises this and helps the lotion work even better.  I would recommend this for all itching, but if you have itching that nothing has helped, give this a try. It's not greasy and works like a charm.	4
My Rottie has food allergies to poultry, beef and dairy. I've had a difficult time finding a toothpaste that doesn't make him allergic and he enjoys the taste. This toothpaste is peanut flavor (smells like black licorice). He loves the taste and doesn't wiggle as much when I brush his teeth every night. The price is ok, but I do wish that the tube came in a larger size. Soooo, if your pup has allergies or doesn't like his/her current toothpaste you might want to try this one.	19
The end that plugs into the device, it not at a right angle, it stick out, and when wearing my phone on my waist the wire is being pulled upward.  Needless to say, about 5 weeks after receiving them the wire inside the connector, or rater right where it sticks out, broke.  Wiggle it just right and I get sound in both earns, if not only 1 ear gets sound.  I returned these for credit and bought a pair of Motorola S305 Bluetooth headphones, and I could not be happier.  Skip this product, you'll thank me later once you did.	7
I use a lot of Black Pepper in my sausage recipes. When I purchase peppercorns in the super market, they cost a small fortune. So these are well worth the price. I have seen Peppercorns that were larger in size but these make up for it in freshness and flavor. If you have one of those empty one quart containers from your Chinese take out? Save it. You will want to store these in the refrigerator. I toast these in a fry pan lightly before use and it brings these to another level. So they are a great buy.	11
"With the heavy wear that I give a mouse pad, I found that often I would have trouble getting the cursor precisely where I wanted.  Additionally I found it necessary to click several times to get my computer to react.  I had no idea that mouse pads varied in quality, sensitivity and drag.This fellow mouse pad is excellent.  The surface lets the mouse move freely with little drag and I am able to control the cursor.  The trouble with the sensitivity of the ""click"" was cured with a better mouse.I recommend the fellows mouse pad.  It meets all my requirements."	17
I can't really say anything that hasn't been said already by the other people who enjoyed this book. There's a reason this book has so many reviews, and it's a good reason. The story sucks you in from the start, and Jankowski remains sharp even when he gets older as evinced by the scenes in present day. Jankowski is a well-made character and the story is as believable as it is engaging. I'd rate this ten stars if I could, but I'm willing to settle for 5 as it's all Amazon will let me do :)	5
Well, now I know what all the hype was about and why they are making a movie. Because the series was cancelled suddenly with NO ENDING!!! How dumb are these TV execs to cancel a show without allowing an ending? I must see the movie when it comes out so I know how it ends. Kudos to Kristen Bell and the guy who plays her dad (can't pronounce or spell his name) and all the friends and boyfriends. I hope we get to see all these characters again soon!	0
OXO designs great products and this is no exception.  It does the job well and the ergonomics put it over the top.  I just don't understand how anyone could have a problem with this product -- it does exactly what it's meant to do with ease.  I liked it so much, I bought one for my aunt.Before this, I made mashed potatoes with a masher; the difference is unbelievable.  I kept my masher because I'm a Southern girl and sometimes I want lumpy mashed potatoes.This is easy to clean -- throw it in the dishwasher.	13
I really need a body wash for my very dry , itchy winter skin. The reviews lead me to purchase this one, but so far it has made no more difference than my other regular body washes. I don't get it's appeal. I think I will maybe try something with ceremides perhaps next time. There are limited choices for extra dry skin from what I can see. I don't think I will repurchase this aveeno not to mention it is NOT sulfate free and I think it's the sulfates that keep my skin so dry after a shower..	4
I like the size of this battery.  It is easily pocket-able and feels sturdy enough to withstand the occasional drop.  The flashlight is a nice touch but it would be nice to see a dedicated switch for the flashlight.  The surface of the battery is very close to a matte black finish that helps with not showing fingerprints.  The battery seems to charge my iPhone without any issues.  It's nice that New Trent has included a charging cable with the device so you can just use your iPhone wall charger or PC for charging.	7
"Kim Stanley Robinson's ""Red/Green/Blue Mars"" series is one of the great trilogies about Mars colonization.  What makes it great is the science is believable and the character interactions spot on.  This is not a series about bug-eyed monsters and ray guns, this is about humans colonizing Mars and the challenges they will face: technical, environmental, social, and political.  I bought a hard back set for myself and lend my well-worn paperback set to friends.  I am now reading more of Ms. Robinson's books which is the best recommendation I could give."	5
"After a friend burned some gum tissue on some overheated coffee, a dentist recommended this product, both for its healing properties and overall cleansing ability.  As listed above, this product is recommended (by ""dental professionals!"")for canker sores, gum irritations, denture & mouth sores, orthodontic irritations, mouth burns, and cheek bites (I'm not sure what the latter is).  I tried a little, and the taste was pleasant and the liquid nonirritating.  There is a mild foaming action as well.  Use ONLY as directed by a dentist or other knowledgeable health professional."	12
Well cast drama quite accurately depicted. Don't believe,however, Jonathan Rhys Meyers would ever be mistaken as a double for the original Henry VIII! Nor would any of the real wives and children be as glamorous as the ones Hollywood chose. But the action, the sets, the activities, the costumes, the political-religious arenas of the day were all so true to life that we must grant Hollywood some leeway. All in all, it was a marvelous portrayal of 15th-16th century England. More such dramas should be presented on TV.	0
This show is a series of melodramatic storylines and overly-pop-styled songs that numb the brains of people matured beyond childhood and the tweens.  These eye-roll-inducing scenes are punctuated by genuinely funny appearances by Jane Lynch.  Her comedy is a raw, edgy, intelligent addition to a show that is basically the demons of American Idol possessing a school.If you are a fan of American Idol, Disney teeny bopper shows, and show tunes, watch this.  If not, run for the hills!Vapid melodrama run amuck with Jane Lynch injected to help you keep your sanity.AVOID.	0
There is a ton of this stuff, and it lasts a long time. I'm still on my first half block, using it three times a week for several lifts. I have pretty sweaty hands, but rubbing this in allows me to grip it and rip it on my lifts. Make sure you have a spare container to keep this in. I'm using a bagel-sized plastic storage container, which is great for allowing you to scoop out a pinch without making a huge mess. That said, this stuff will leave a powdery mess.	20
I'm sure that this add-on was pressured by the public to be released  quickly due to the great succsess of Baldur's Gate, but at the time of  release the price tag seemed a bit high for so little substance. Other than  some new areas and quests to complete, the only redeeming quality of this  package was the experience cap being rasied a tad giving all those  dual-class humans a chance to shine.  As a nice bonus, there are some  REALLY cool new magical items that could ease the time an Import character  will have in the next installment.	23
Worked great for the three months that it functioned.  I liked the glass jar and it made great smoothies.  It was powerful and never bogged down.  Then it just quit working.  It is made in China and of apparently poor quality.  Too expensive to buy one every three months.  I would look for something with better reviews.I changed my review on this from one star to four stars because the manufacturer stands by there product.  They replaced the blender with no hassles.  However, it still broke after three months so you should be careful.	13
I've always liked this setup to clean gravel and drain/fill my tank. The only problem with this is the awkward plastic nut that attaches to the sink. I don't know why they made it like this, but the more you screw it onto the sink, the more you loosen a part that lets water spray out. I can't figure it out, it's also hard to explain without physically showing it. My other gravel cleaner doesnt have the awkward fitting with this problem. I get it to work nonetheless.	19
The traditional 501 has always been a favorite of mine.The jeans I received are identical to previous 501's except for one thing:The &#34;rise&#34;, the distance betwen the crotch and the upper edge of the pants, is smaller than it has always been, by about 1/2 inch. It may seem as a small difference, but I noticed it right away, and then confirmed by taking a tape measure to my old 501's and this one.This may not matter to some people, but it makes a difference to me.	8
I always like to try new tools. When I got my new DeWalt framing saw, I loved the weight advantage it had over my old Skil wormdrive. It's not much lighter than my newer Mag 77.  The balance is different though. It took  some getting used to . The rafter hook is just one plus I have come to  love. I miss it when I'm using one of my Skilsaws.The extra power is a nice  touch if you're ripping with a dull blade. An excellent tool overall. Why  do I find myself still reaching for my Mag 77 ?	21
I bought this book because I wanted to see the movie.  I opened it and the first few pages compelled me to download it immediately.  I have been reading it through the new year and hate putting it down!  AWESOME book, it has everything you'd think went &#34;behind the scenes&#34; in the 30s in a circus...  :)Plus the Jacob J character at 90 or 25 is an amazing write... being a writer, I can say that the character had me at the visual in the first few pages!	5
I have always loved sci-fi stuff but real science intimidated me a LOT. I went back to college in my 40s and found out not only did I like science I was pretty good at it. This led to an interest in shows and books I wouldn't have touched earlier. This show takes the people on the cutting edge of science and tops in their field and presents their ideas in laymen terms as much as possible. Since I am definitely a layman I appreciate this very much. I am looking forward to season 3 :-)!	0
This cable functions fine (at first), but it probably won't hold up to everyday use.  I've inserted mine maybe 20 times, and one of the spring-loaded contacts just became permanently stuck, making the cable worthless.  Sure it's dirt cheap, which is nice compared to the expensive real Nokia cable, but with what these accessory vendors charge for shipping, I'd recommend ordering several of these at one time from a source with a good deal on multiple items.  I'm now trying to decide whether to do that myself or shell out for the real deal with a real warranty.	7
I have tried many brands of pencil lead which fall in similar price range.  None made me happy.  They either smudged too much or broke or were too light.  Then I discovered Pentel.  I have purchased this same lead (and also the 0.5 size too for other pencils of mine) many times and just ordered 3 more packs.  I am a college student majoring in accounting and therefore go thru a lot of pencil lead.  This writes nice and smooth, every piece of lead is consistent in size, erases clean, and hardly smudges.	17
I still have all my flowers out front so it must be working.  It has a mild smell when first sprayed but dries up and becomes odorless fairly quickly.  It doesn't bother my dog though as he still walks up to the bushes to urinate on them, so dogs, or at least him, must not be bothered by it.  I use this in combination with the Havahart Solar Powered Water Sprinkler in my backyard raised garden bed and so far so good.  If you have trouble with rabbits, deers, and squirrels, give it a try.  It's safe around humans and pets.  I recommend it.	18
Swanson has been around since - what - 1929?  Well, this square looks like it was cast from a mold from 1929! The markings look very crude.  Kudos that it is made in USA, but I saw the Empire square (also made in USA) at the Orange Box store for the same price and the readability was markedly better.  I think it was this product that I intend to replace the Swanson with:Empire Level e2992 Heavy-Duty Magnum 7-Inch Hi-Vis Rafter SquarePerhaps there are some minor differences, but nothing that would make me pick the Swanson over the Empire AFAIK.	21
This oil is just right for the renewal of your filter and should be used instead of SAE 30 alone.  It adheres better and as packaged is much easier to apply than sticking it and the filter in a bag and mushing it around.  It also uses less oil and gives precise coverage.  Oil your filter and get better air flow and better particle removal at the same time.You might be able to keep uncle Phil away from when you are grilling if you waft a little bit of it his way on approach, too, but maybe you shouldn't do that.	2
I love oatmeal and always purchased rolled or instant oats. I never knew what I was missing out on until I tried steel cut oatmeal.  There is so much more flavor, great texture, and nutrition compared to rolled oats. It's nutty aroma fills the kitchen. This oat cereal does take a little longer to cook (around 20-30 minutes) but believe me, it is well worth it. I add a little brown sugar, cream, and low fat butter to mine and it makes a perfect, healthy breakfast.	11
These socks are absolutely amazing, and I cannot believe how much better my feet feel after long walks or workouts with wearing them.  They make all of the difference in the world.I learned about the Cool Max sox from reading Leslie Sansone's book, and decided I should use all of the research that the US Army put into finding which socks held up well for soldiers in the field.  These are for walking workouts, and have excellent cushioning just where you need it, plus they wick away moisture.Your feet will love you for getting these!	8
"This item seems like a good idea, but after purchasing two I feel that we've fallen victim to ""new parent baby marketing"". Our baby wasn't interested at all in sucking on anything in it. She woudln't even go for fruits that we knew she loved. I'm guessing the mesh is too distracting or annoying to them(?) She would just shake it around, bang it, or throw it. Also, it's a total pain to clean it. The netting never gets clean in the dishwasher.Save your money on this one."	3
We have a lot of rabbits around our house. Sometimes we don't mind them, but sometimes they're a bit of a nuisance, eating our vegetables, pooping on our grass and (more recently) burrowing under our house.I got this because I heard good things about Deer Off in general and  love the battery-powered delivery system (as opposed to the pump I'm used to with other products).I also have 5 young kids, and I appreciated that this product is supposed to be safe around them!Good product overall.	18
Why??? Runs horribly now even on a dual core and is literally 10 times larger than a year ago and for what? Please, please stop this and optimize this app!!!! I hate giving it one star but there is no excuse for this. And WHY do you store the book data in the app/system space instead of of user/sdcard storage space? AND when one deletes (archives) a book, why doesn't the app remove it from local storage? Why are these very basic housekeeping functions and storage decisions so poorly implemented? :(	1
I had a pair of Portapros for years and years.  When they finally wore out, I didn't feel bad replacing them.  I bought a second pair on Amazon last year (2012) and the wire at the plug has already broken on them despite careful use.  Reading the Sportapro review, the plug seems to be a weak link and I'm afraid that the Portapros have the same issue now.  It's really a bummer, they used to be GREAT.  Not sure what to replace them with.	10
I use this for everything from propping up cookbooks in the kitchen to reading hardcovers at my desk while eating my lunch.  Most recently I've been using it for my Kindle 2.  Works great for everything, but a little tricky for some paperbacks because they slip around a little bit.  It does work best with the average-sized hardcover (think novel- sized).  Folds up nice and fits well in a drawer or in the front pocket of my backpack.  Definitely a handy thing to have around.	13
My dog is very spoiled ans has access to 20++ &#34;babies&#34;...this Kong Teddy Bear is always on his bed or near on the floor. I put it back in his bin and less that 24 hours later there is the Teddy Bear! Very soft, strong build quality (he has used it for over 6 months; 70lb German Sheppard/Doberman and &#34;plays&#34; with his &#34;babies&#34;). I highly recommend this product as a cost-effective toy that, for my dog at least, is a must-have on a daily basis. As I type he is laying with it on his bed!	19
This is just a battery right? (Duracell Coppertop with Duralock)The D cells I received from Amazon have a expiration date on the battery Dec 2022. Bought these Dec 2012, so I get 10years. See photo in customer photo section.Great to see expiration date on battery!!  NO MORE GUESSING if they're too old.My D cells came in a plastic box suitable for storage.Price here on Amazon for 8 D cell was much lower than any retail outlet.Good price, fresh batteries. 5 starsShips from and Sold by Amazon	12
This was a well told, interesting Kindle short. It reminded me of an odd dream where everything seems real but nothing is really as it should be. There is no good way to explain the story without giving too much away (although there really is no beginning, middle, or ending, it just 'is'. )It is easy to read into where the tale is going but then, it doesn't. But that is what makes it good. It is not contrived or common.A quick and quirky tale that left me wanting to read more of Mr. Hill's work.	14
As soon as I got this pedal I put it on my board and noticed it had a high end hum. I have a 2 Behringer pedals on my board and a lot of people say they are bad noisy pedals,but my pedal board was silent till I put this pedal on it. I've only had it for a few days, but the cons out way the pros. Maybe I will purchase a noise reducer to help clean it up a bit. Once I get around to playing with it I will write another review.	16
I have used this with my last 2 pregnancies and have no stretch marks. Don't know if it's because of this oil, but I know it can't hurt! I love that this oil does not stain, however, I only use it at night under my tank tops that I wear to bed. This oil does have a slight cocoa smell, but it's not nauseating at all. I am easily turned off by strong odors, but it's so faint that I don't smell it for long. Would highly recommend!	4
I could not get far in this because of some bugs and problems. Not sure if its because it is an older type game but I just could not get into it to figure out how to get it to work. May work on Older Operating systems like Windows 98 or Windows XP with the Program Compatibility settings but Windows 7 and 8 Wont run it. As for game-play it was not on the high list of mine the little that I did get to work around and try. Just my personal tastes but FPS games are not that great to me.	23
I buy 2 packs of these EVERY MONTH for work. We use them for a digital scale built into our forklifts. This is in use 8 hours a day, 5 days a week... standard 40 hours. I get them with Subscribe & Save. I don't think you can possibly get similar quality for the price, and rechargeable D Batteries!? Yea right!! With the risk of damaging the batteries here, I don't think so. Not for that price. Duracell is the way to go!	12
I remember when the Sega Dreamcast was released, everybody thought of it as this mythical system, that would take gaming to a whole new level. When released it had great games, Sonic Adventure, Power Stone, NFL 2K and such on.The games are fun, and the controller feels great, there have been suspicions that the Xbox 1 and Xbox 360 controller was designed from it. Graphics are great for the time, and still aren't a eye sore, even when compared to todays system graphics, it holds up fairly well.I defintely would consider the Dreamcast in the top 5 best gaming systems of all time.	23
Born in the 1970's, I never heard of The Avengers until I watched the reruns on BBC America.  I'm really sorry I haven't seen this series earlier.It's weird watching the black and white episodes after you're used to watching the color shows.  But color added a surreal touch to the show: Emma Peel's sometimes futuristic wardrobe comes to life and, it seems, the plots got more far out (then again, 1967 was a very far out year).I'm glued to every episode of The Avengers and wish TV shows nowadays could be as interesting.	15
This was my first Grace Livingston Hill book and it is the one that sparked my interest in GLH books to begin with! Well written, the mean characters are truly mean and the good truly good, some of the scenarios had me laughing and cheering throughout. This is a must-read (I didn't read the other books in the Schuyler series until afterward, so if you wanted you can start with Marcia Schuyler and then read Phoebe Dean, but each book in the Schuyler series could be read as a standalone)	14

We don't have a dishwasher so I throw everything in the sterilizer (bottles, breastpump parts, binkies, etc.)after washing with soap and water. It is easy to use, just throw items in, 7 ounces of water and microwave for 7 minutes. I use this sterilizer daily.I only gave it four stars because I put in the breast shield from my First Years breast pump and it melted a bit where the shield sat in the appropriate slot. I can still use the breast shield but there is a permanent dent melted into it. Otherwise, I love this sterilizer!	3
I guess it is hard to work up great enthusiasm about file folders.  Essentially, they are are all much the same.  In the past the only issue I have ever had with folders would be when the weight of the stock was inadequate.  These particular folders are of average weight and are quite adequate.  The selling feature for me is the reinforced tab feature.  Tabs have a tendency to get folded, creased, and torn--I hate when that happens.  The reinforced tabs hold up extremely well!	17
Presented as a mock documentary complete with narration by radio ham Jackson Beck, Allen's hilarious directorial debut is nuttier and loaded with more gags than his later, more sophisticated New York films. But that's exactly why it works: The laughs are goofy and often puerile, and for all the zippy one-liners that don't quite elicit a full-belly guffaw, Allen piles on with cutting satire (focused mostly on footage of presidents Nixon and Eisenhower). You'll have a lot of fun watching this manic genius at work in one of his earlier comedic efforts.	15
The title says it all. I loved these, but you literally have to wrestle your kid and near mangle his feet, even when a size or two too big- to get them on. THEN you have to lace and tie them! On a kicking toddler! Yeah, right! IMPOSSIBLE to get on for the most part. And don't seem comfortable either. they need to create this same shoe, but but an easy access ZIPPER on the side, down to the toe bed to get the young child's foot inside.	8
The main feature of this ball is a tacky surface that makes the ball easier to grip.  This feature works really well.  This ball has a noticeably better grip than the Wilson indoor/outdoor ball that I have been using for casual driveway basketball.  Otherwise, it is a typical indoor/outdoor ball.  It is well made and keeps inflated.  One interesting fact about this tacky ball is that when wet it becomes much slicker than a standard ball, which grips about the same when playing on a wet driveway.	20
Very convenient product to have that allows for easy movement from one vehicle to the next.  The speaker quality is good and the ability to shift the microphone to a different angle is a nice touch.  I gave it 4 stars because it doesn't consistently automatically connect to the LG enV phone after pairing the two devices together.  Sometimes if I try to make a call via voice dial, it won't activate the phones voice dial feature like it should when I press the Answer/End button.  Overall the product is a good product, but LG enV buyers beware of the inconsistencies.	7
this game is sweet because you can choose from three different story modes, terran, zerg and protoss. and also what is cool about this game is that it is an expansion pack. i dont know/get haow to play mutiplayer on this game but everyone else pry does. you can also make your own place. if only they made one of these for GC,PS2,or XBOX. if you know how to play warcraft you know how to play this game. all the people are different in this game and which fate will you choose?	23
H Beam Piper will stand as one of the greats of sci-fi/fantasy for as long as the printed word exists, whether you are a mystery/thriller, detective novel or space opera/alternative universe fan, Piper delivers. In H B's writing you will find the forerunner of many who followed in his ginormous footsteps, (federated terran space, space vikings, even his place names have been copied by later writers! Aldebaran sound familiar)? Great reading, great fun and a must for anyone who really wants to be lost in another space/time continuum!	14
I have tried several backgammon games and this is the best by far!!!!!!!!!  No questions asked, don't even bothering trying any others.  If you own any Apple products and want a good backgammon game, I feel sorry for you because Apple doesn't have this version.  All of their version can't compare.  There are a lot of comments about this game cheating, I don't have that problem and I beat the game frequently on the most advanced level. Love the speednof the game too.	1
[One CD, with a running time of 53:18] Fifty-three minutes of pure paradise! These twelve songs show off Toni Braxton's silky smooth voice at its best. R&B; or pop, whatever you want to call these songs, all are smooth, quiet, and easy to listen to love songs that make for some excellent slow dancing. My favorites are Another Sad Love Song and Breathe Again. But, all of the songs on this CD are excellent!As an added bonus, the CD's paperwork contains the words to the songs, plus the back is a nice, small poster. I love extras!	9
Got one of these for my 3 year old Lab/Husky mix since she is always trying to steal my 2 year old Shepherd/Husky mix's Nylabone chew. She loves it! She used to not chew on toys much, but I guess after seeing how much fun her little brother had, she decided to join in. I have had good experiences with other Nylabone products, especially the fact they have been very durable. After several hours of heavy chewing, just the top is frilly and chewed. Haven't had any problems with them breaking either.	19
This is a great game, it has a lot of depth.  There are multiple ways to play the game to win.  You can focus your efforts in one area or diversify to gain honor in your village in several areas.  This game has tons of replay value.  I have been playing it with my 9 and 10 year old kids despite the 12 and up tag.  It is simple enough that they were easily able to play it, and complex enough that it is fun to play again and again.  5 stars, this is a great game!	22
My daughter, (who is now 8 years old), received this as a christmas gift when she was 2.  It has been ready many times, and since been passed along to my son who is now 4.  My children enjoy the tactile quality of the monkeys faces. It is helpful learning counting when there is something they can feel.  I have always enjoyed reading the sing song story.  It doesn't take long to read, and after all these years I pretty much have it memorized.  A great book, very fun.	22
this movie, in a very graphic way, shows how CHRIST died at the hands of violent people who did not  know who he was, but JESUS  was willing to endure his fate..when i think of my children it is so hard to understand GODS deep love for his children, that he gave his only BEGOTTEN SON. i am so glad that he loves us that much.....a wonderful movie, it is very heart wretching and someone with a heart condition should be very careful when they watch it.....mell gibson is my most favorite director................	15
This App, is a really good app, complete, with a lot of interesting link, and the pronounce of the wordOf course to save the precious memory of our Android devices, the database is on-line, so when you can't have connection, the program doesn't works.Some android devices can install application on a additional memory card, and a release of the app, installable on a memory card, working off line will be great.So if you have no problem to stay on line, this is a really great app!	1
You can't go wrong with these. I've installed them on EVERY Fender I own. Even if you don't use the trem very often, they help maintain proper tuning if you overbend (which I'm prone to do). I haven't had any tuning or slippage issues when I have these on, and you shouldn't either.Easy to install also, and for the money, give them a go...they're just as solid as the pricier ones...and they're Fender, so how can you go wrong?	16
I'm used to Julia James doing really involved books, where she leads you to think that the heroine is undesirable but in the end turns out to be the most awesome kind of woman there is. And I don't like her other type of book. I really liked this little book, if it could be called a book. The very first book of hers that I read was The Greek's Million-Dollar Baby, which was of good enough quality for me to proceed to buy at least 5 more of her books within the following days, and this is easily better.	14
"When I originally reviewed the 12-pack of these, they were 30% more expensive than elsewhere, but now, via subscription, this is a better price than I can get at any store.  They are as fresh or fresher than those bought in stores, and each unit of four six-bar packages is sealed in heavy-duty plastic.  Delivery is prompt as well.  I agree with the ""Leading consumer magazine"" that rated these to be the best of all granola bars.  They have no cheap, unhealthy ingredients -- just stuff that tastes great and is good for us, barring allergies."	11
My son is 7 and very smart so I thought this could be a good intro to simple programming.  It is definitely a few years beyond him.  I didn't realize that Recon would do nothing at all on a basic toy level--it is all somewhat serious programming.  There's really nothing my son can do with it at this point so we will be storing it away for future use.  Once he gets to the level he needs to be, I'm sure this will be a delightful learning toy.	22
I agree with another reviewer here, who pointed out that this Dragon Fire lacks an option to change the settings of the game, in the event the player is colorblind.As a colorblind American, who has extreme difficulty telling the difference between reds, yellows, and greens in software, I encourage game developers to include options to turn on a &quot;colorblind&quot; mode.Many game developers, such as PopCap, already routinely feature this in their games.This game, Dragon Fire, would be greatly improved if such a feature was added in a future update.	1
Stocked up on crackers at the excellent Amazon Grocery price in anticipation of the holiday parties and drop-in guests. Simple snack to have on hand for soups, cheese, and dips. Who doesn't love the buttery goodness of a Club Cracker.  Seriously, just good. No problems in shipping, arrived in great conditioned and wrapped in plastic. If you like to buy in bulk (or are expecting a house full this holiday season), this pack of four will serve you well. Pricing, shipping, and quality all great. Enjoy!	11
I tried so many different ways to pop this like I had seen on &#34;Bazar foods&#34; and I am not having a lot of luck. I have found a tablespoon of coconut oil in a microwave popper to be the best so far but I still have a poor popping ratio of only about 50%. I love the sweet nutty flavor and crunchy texture but with such a large % of un-popped berries it is not really cost effective. I may give it a try again this summer as I purchased some seed to plant and will harvest my own.	11
"Episodes like ""TSST"" (the Dog Whisperer episode) and ""The Mystery of the Urinal Deuce"" (featuring the Hardly Boys) are funnier the second and third time around.  The show is uneven, sure, but basically an American treasure.  The real prizes in this season are the 2-parters, the ""Family Guy"" 2-parter and the ""Go God Go"" 2-parter featuring Cartman in the 25th Century.  If you haven't seen either of those, you've missed out on some of the best TV ever aired."	0
Amazon has them for $5, 4 times the $1.48 the extra fines sell for.I bought extra fines last time because they were so much cheaper but I prefer the .38 ultra fines.Used to sell them on the shelves at the W-store but no more.The .38 has great reviews & lots of fans. Where does everyone buy them at a reasonable price ?I recently bought a G2 pro as Ive been using the regular g2s for years and decided to splurge the $2.88 they cost.LOL	17
"The batteries were exactly as advertised, they were delivered in a normal timeframe, there were no issues or hiccups or drama with the vendor.  It was ""slam, bam, thank you, sirs or madams.""  Battery life is really subjective as everyone's ""normal"" is different.  But life is definitely restored compared to my original 2 year old battery.  My experience is use of Bluetooth really drains batteries quickly.  But that's a Bluetooth issue that goes away if you don't use Bluetooth.  I have no complaints at all with this product."	7
I  purchased this router specifically to cut dovetails for dresser drawers and it works very well.  The handle helps me stabilize the router and control the power instantly rather than having to reach for the power switch to turn it off.  One caveat about using this product to cut dovetails in plywood veneer:  Despite trying all of the fixes I found on-line for the tear out problem, I had very poor results.  Using solid wood, however, resulted in dovetails that were tight and strong.  This router does what it's supposed to do and is a high quality product.	21
"This is a movie where one can feel and breathe the atmosphere of the 17th century in ""medieval"" Europe during the Thirty Years War, with its ignorance and violence. How servile and oppressive to accept the delivery of some maids to the soldiers that occupy the ""peaceful"" valley!. It is impressive the role of the Captain played by Michael Caine as a professional warrior symbol, the role of Per Oscarsson as a fanatical priest is impressive too. Of course there is also some place for love  in the film. The end is shocking and almost everybody is moved by this epic story."	15
I owned one of these for about three months, then it started to fall apart.  It was $30 at Best Buy.  I haven't replaced it, as $30 is a *lot*.$10?  I'm buying two more.  I can be moving 20 mph on my bicycle, talking to someone, with no problems.  It has far better sound quality than my 'backup', which is a Jabra with no boom.  The ear volume is adjustable on my phone, and I'm wondering what phones other reviewers have that won't let them adjust the volume?	7
I am an audio newbie and for me, these sound great. I know that one can always spend more money, but these worked just fine for me, but only for about four years. The left-hand side of the headphones just fell apart. One day, they were working fine, the next they break on me and become unusable, hanging by a single cord. I didn't use these every day, but only on occasion. I would have thought that they'd have lasted me 5-7 years, but I was way off.	10
I can see my own kind, I'm not blind or mabye I am. Anyway I go to the graveyard yo see my buddy Jeff, it did not detect his presance AT ALL!!! Then I go to walmart and A BILLION FAKE GHOSTS WERE THERE!!!!! I think this is THE AVERAGE SHOPPER RADAR!!!!! It kept saying FOOD and SALES and BUY. WHAT?!?!?!  At least say what kind of app this is. MAYBE ITS A TYPO?!?! Well ALWAYS READ REVEIWS. Three stars cause it does something. SO IF NEED YOU TO FIND THE AVERAGE SHOPPER BUY THIS. Btw...BOOOOOOO!	1
serves its purpose, but is pretty cheap.if i had to do over, i'd spend an extra $10 and get a heavy duty one.  that way, i could at least have another 10 foot hose that i could use in another application.i put a rubber washer in the female end (all hoses need them, with the more 'heavy duty' ones having them built-in), and that fixed any leaking (cost an extra 30 cents or so).not the best hose in the world, but for $10, it's hard to get pissy about it.	18
Well, it's not the collar's fault.  It does work great!  My two Cavaliers won't bark while wearing them.  The problem is.  They know it's the collar.  So, they haven't so much learned not to bark, as they have learned not to bark when they are wearing that collar or if they see me holding it.  Barkley, will actually go hide behind the couch if he sees me with it.  And since you can't safely leave them alone while wearing them, this doesn't halt the annoying barking when I leave. :(	19

Why spend an extra hundred dollars to get the palm Vx, which is half the size of palm III, and then add a case which makes it about the same size as the palm III again.This unit looks very protective because of the aluminum finish.  However, it is only hardened plastic ... not a great shock protector.  In addition, I had trouble getting the catch to stay closed.I got this as a gift, tried it and do not use it because it adds too much additional bulk.	10
I've used Mederma in the past and it worked really well. Well, I've had to purchase it again because of my lovely doggie Isabella. I have so many scratches because of her jumping and playing. I've been using it for a little over a month,and again it's working. This is good stuff. I saw improvement in a week. Of course I would purchase this again,if fact I'll be doing that real soon. I would recommend this to a friend. I think Mederma deserves more than five stars.	12
I started using it only a few weeks ago. I have combination skin. I recommend using a moisturizer with it because I noticed my skin started peeling. Although, my skin looks clearer, some of my old freckles seem to be fading, and I just really notice a difference in my skin. I also feel it helps my vitamin C moisturizer absorb better. I used to use Retin-A and Retin-A micro, but I feel this stuff works just as well, plus it has other ingredients that help improve your skin.	4
This story takes place during the Great Depression.  It is a love story, but also a story about life with a traveling circus and all the rawness and crudeness that goes along with being part of the Benzini Brothers Most Spectacular Show on Earth as remembered by Jacob Jankowski.  Normally, I'd much rather do my own reading, however David LeDoux and John Randolph Jones did an excellent job; the ninety-something-year-old Jacob was especially enjoyable.  When he read, I felt as if I were sitting next to him in the nursing home listening to his amazing story.	5
I bought this bra over two years ago on a whim from a different website, and I almost wore it out to the point where the hooks on the back started coming apart. Its lacy so I wasn't expecting much comfort, but I literally wore it day and night PLUS my girls arent as &#34;perky&#34; as they were after my first baby so they give excellent support, are true to size, and comfortable enough. They also dont show through any cute shirt you might want to wear.	8
"I was so disappointed with this book, it had so much potential but didnt really go anywhere.  The characters were shallow, the plot was predicatable.  Very disappointing.  I imagine this would be a good read for younger audiences or those new to the fantasy genre or who want a ""lollypop"" version of the middle ages, but if you're serious about your fantasy/sci fi fiction, don't bother with this book.  You'll find it too chaste and shallow with no depth or realism.  Not for serious fans!"	14
We've only ever use Scotch tape at my house, it's the tape that holds up better in not ripping or tearing when you don't want it to. It's always been stronger in keeping this together than the cheaper brands. The Gift Wrap tape is excellent for wrapping any gifts as it boasts a certain amount invisibility. It doesn't completely disappear, of course, but it's less noticeable than other kinds of tape. The price for three roles is pretty cheap as well. I would definitely recommend this Scotch Gift Wrap for any holiday or birthday wrapping you need.	17
Hey, this is by far the biggest step up in portable tube-vision that will ever happen.  Great picture and sound quality comes from the 2 speakers.  The only thing that you might want to think about here is the battery life!  This was a major frustration in trying to watch any movie more than 2  hours long since the battery life is approximately two hours.  This was  pretty good however, and the battery life doesn't hurt the rating for me  since I got the power adapter!	10
Good solid earbuds. The sound is surprisingly good, really a step up from the cheap sony $9.99 earbuds. They are very comfortable, and stay in your ear well. I can't stand the feeling of that coarse foam that is used on most headphones, so these are a great alternative.  Also, the 4' cord is nice, compared to most other earbuds that only have a 3' cord. The only potential problem I see, is that the cord is fairly small gage wire, hope it doesn't break, but they do have a lifetime warranty.	10
This game is blew me away! I didn't expect Ocarina to meet with my standards after playing the previous Zelda games.  They usually go stale and predictable, but Ocarina didn't do that.  It's a game for true fans of the adventure genre!  The dungeons are long and perilous, there are numerous side-quests, a great cast of characters, and a large world to travel!  If you have any doubts about this game, eliminate them.  You won't be dissapointed!	23
"I started out with the ""kit"" (cleaner & oil) for my K&N.  It just seems that the oil lasted longer than the cleaner, especially if your filters get really dirty and you have to clean a second time.  The 32 oz. may cost as much as the kit, but it also has 4x the amount of cleaner in the spay bottle.  The larger spray bottle has a larger dispersal sprayer than the one in the kit, so it takes less time to spray down your filter."	2
This application gives anyone with a internet accessible device the ability to scan local police and emergency services. Not only that it will scan police and emergency services where ever you are. just go to the browse menu and browse for service where ever you happen to be. I have this on all my phones and even my kindle fire HD. You can go to Wal-Mart or Radio Shack and buy a scanner for a hundred bucks but why would you spend the money when you can just download this scanner on your  internet device?	1
Out of the box you will be impressed with this great multitool! Beautifully polished, individual locking tools that don't clump when you open them. That pliers are not needle nose but I like the compromise. The stout but slightly rounded nose is precise enough for most precision jobs but because the metal is of softer material I can understand why they don't included it. The craftsmanship on this tool is top notch and better than any other multitool I ever had. What more can I say, it's a victorinox!	20
The movie was based on the Bible which is historically correct.  This is the most powerful movie to date. A visually stunning cinematic experience.  While watching you should have a box of tissues handy because to know that Jesus suffered for us in that way you will not be able to help yourself from crying if not weeping.  I would recommend that everyone watch the movie even if you don't believe in Jesus.  The directing was done on an expert level by Mel Gibson and I commend him for putting this film out to the public.	15
I mostly use the Ameda electric, but used this on a weekend trip and was very pleased with the milk volume.  I get most of the milk in just a few minutes and the one hand operation is simple.Drawbacks: it can be tricky to get the suction going, but little pumps at first followed by long slow pumps will eventually get it. Also, I've found that I can still get milk out with my electric even after I'm done with the Isis.  It is a little higher maintenance to clean, but I still recommend it.	3
Hopefully these perform as described. They are exactly what I need, but who can tell until they run down how long they will work? While I was away from my Home this winter, the alkaline batteries in my programmable thermostat died and did not turn on my heating system. I barely missed getting frozen pipes. If they perform as described they will be cheap insurance for repeating this problem, but I don't know if they will work for even 10 years, but certainly I can count on a couple of years from them, fingers crossed.	12
...it sure didn't work for me.  In spite of having balanced the wheels and having installed and carefully aligned machined cast iron V-belt pulleys, my Delta bandsaw still had an annoying vibration.  Since the belt was old and worn and had taken a bit of a set, I figured that had to be the problem. So after reading the gushing reviews here, I bought a Power Twist belt. No dice. If anything, it made the vibration worse. Since it's still a functional drive belt, I'll give it two stars, but it certainly fell far short of expectations.	21
"Delta's information is best described by a four letter word starting with an S.  So the next guy knows:  I successfully installed this on a 10"" Left-Tilt Contractor's Saw, model number 36-979.  I was only able to use one screw, however it is attached and solid.  I had minimal difficulties installing and aligning.  At some point I may machine some form of block to act as future lockdown.  My 36-979 came with three holes around the bracket, and I had to play a bit to find the one that fit best.  Once on, it works fine."	21
"I had a similar style (fabric-over-rubber) mouse pad since the 90s that I got from a store as a ""gift with purchase"".  It worked with both ball and optical mice, but it started to peel from age.  My old employer had some promotional pads made from vinyl and I couldn't believe how much build-up generated on the bottom of the mice.Found these here at Amazon and ordered 3 - this is exactly what I wanted... a durable fabric-over-rubber mouse pad, perfect size for the desk, inexpensive, and functional.  No markings or logos on it, just plain black.  Couldn't ask for better."	17
Except for having to switch discs all the time!!!  I know it's a fact that this game was so big, you had to swap discs, that's the only reason I didn't give it a 5!!!  Other than that the game is completely immersive.  It puts you right in the world of Riven.  This game inspired me to purchase Myst.  Part I in the series.  I hope that they make more of these games for the Playstation 2 and 3 coming out.  Myst III: Exile was the last game to be ported on the Playstation 2.  Come on Cyan, put more out for the Playstations!!	23
In an outside sensor for an indoors weather station, these batteries rock. I spent years with my outside weather readings coming and going before I read the manual and saw that they now suggest Lithium batteries. Stuck a pair of these dudes into the remote sensor and have not had a problem in cold weather. With the Duracells, and I love Duracells, I was always loosing my outside temperatures anywhere below 30 degrees (F). So far I have gotten to -4 (F) with no dropouts. Very nice.	12
I loved this book. While it has history it is not a dull history book and the history is indeed interesting. The book details the lives of different people enveloped in the gold rush from a wonderful clergy man ,a young Irish woman with a keen sense for business, successful and not so successful miners plus those who went there with no knowledge of mining or life in the very rugged north.The book is very well written and weaves the history, the town of Dawson, and the individual characters together seamlessly.	5
"I loved my SRIII.  Solid sound quality, excellent AM receptivity (but only average FM receptivity).But it wasn't very hardy.  I took it camping once, and it was never the same after that.  It took several minutes to ""warm up"" after you turned it on, and then the sound was distorted for several minutes after that.  And scratchy sounds came out of the speaker when you adjusted the volume.  I figure the radio didn't like the humidity of the day and the dew of the morning."	10
I am very pleased with these headphones.  They produce great sound, are light weight and adjustable, and fold to a very compact size.My only complaint is that they came with an adapter for a large input jack (which is very rarely found) instead of an adapter for two prong jacks (which are required for using these headphones on an airplane).  I couldn't even find an adapter at Radio Shack so ended up listening to the audio on the airplane in one ear only.  Oh well, otherwise they're great.	10
I thought this season was okay.It was still a cute romantic comedy/dramedy type of show.The problems that Gavin and Stacey faced were realistic.Although,they were handled in a ridiculous manner in some instances,it did not take anything away from the show.The last episode was a bit too predictable,but it tied in with the premise of the show and wasn't disappointing.I rated it a bit down for predictability,but then again,it is a comedy and we'll worth watching.	0
This game is incredible. The graphics are great and the game play is awesome. You can build several different-style rides, including water slides, go carts, bumper cars, and classic rides such as the ferris wheel, scrambler, and merry-go-round. And who could forget the roller coasters? Pick your design and place a pre-constructed layout or build your own for unlimited designs. This is one of the best games I have, and I would recommend you go get it right now!	23
"This albums ok.  I got it day it was out, cuz i was a pac fan before he died, unlike 60% of his fans now.  But this was the best album that was released after he died.  I love ""Hold On Be Strong"", "" When I Get Free 2"".  ill tracks right there.  Im sick of these new cds tho, they should just stop.  I mean, Trick Daddy and Pac?!  I like trick, but damn, Better Dayz was...well, the only good tracks were the Outlawz tracks!"	9
"Though this is a nice sturdy potty seat and would probably be perfect for girls or larger boys, it did not work for me.  My son has to hoist himself off and on the potty as he is not yet tall enough to rest his feet on the foot stool while using it.  The pee guard is so large that I was seriously concerned about his ""equipment"" being damaged in the process of trying to stand up. I recommend the Arm and Hammer potty seat over this (much cheaper too)."	3
I HATE...HATE, HATE keeping journals. I have resisted for years...but I really want to lose weight ..so when I found out about this app..I was sceptical.I have now logged in for a month..built a community of others..have it on my phone..my kindle and my computer...so no excuses...I love it and use it every day...and seeing progress really helps me.Yes there are lots of other programs...but it is time to pick one and use it..no excuses.	1
Luther rates with other top TV serialized dramas -- it's not just another cop show.  The characters are well-written:  complex and fallible, very fallible.  There are definitely bad guys (usually a new serial killer each episode), but the good guys have plenty of flaws too.  And the actors are up to the writing.  Idris Elba (Luther) and the rest of the cast deliver great performances.  Definitely worth watching.  The only downside:  only six episodes in Season 1.  Worth it nonetheless.	0
I recently purchased Legend of a Band along with the longer and more expensive Classic Artists 3-DVD set.  I must say while LOAB doesn't show as much footage as CA, it does seem to tell the story much clearer and without a lot of the superfulous interviews of people that most of us have never heard of anyway.  I am a huge John Lodge fan and the segment of him at the  site of The Isle of Wight Festival was fantastic and that alone was well worth the price of the DVD! I highly recommend this to any MB fan.	6
I've used PC tools for years, and I wouldn't own another brand of belt sander or router.  I've used and abused them, to the point of smoke coming out of the motor a few times, and after they cool off they just keep on ticking.This belt sander has a lot of power, but it's the ergonomics that make it my favorite--it's very comfortable to hold and, more importantly, to keep level when you really need to lean on it to remove some wood.  The dust bag swivels a little too easily, but it's not a show-stopper by any means.	21
UL61 is the first at-home coloring product that hasn't left me super duper red tones. I followed the directions exactly... so put it on everything but the roots for 20 minutes, and then the roots for 10.  I debated doing this as I have short hair--but decided I should follow the directions regardless and it turned out perfectly.  I'm super happy.  I just wish they'd make this formula in foam.  Hopefully one of these days.Amazon subscribe-and-save is the best way to buy it.  Cheaper than the store, plus guaranteed that it will arrive when you need it.	4
Mothra vs. Godzilla is one of the best Godzilla films ever. The bright colors, the excellent special effects, the monster action, and a basic, yet interesting plot all come together and make this movie what it is. This movie is just pure fun for any fan of giant monsters and/or old-school sci-fi flicks. This movie is also a lot less campy than the future films in the series. As a sci-fi film, it's four stars, but among Godzilla films, it's easily five.If you're already a Godzilla fan, don't hesitate to pick this up as soon as you can!	15
"This sequel to ""An American Tail"" is a fine animated film full of Old West Americana; the stuff legends are made of. It is full of great characters and you may even soon forget that you are watching an animated film. The story and dialogue are that good! James Horner seems to have really come of age with this memorable score. It is as much homage to Copland as it is to the American West. This was James Stewart's last theatrical film. This is a good and entertaining family film, which expounds virtues of loyalty and honor. Highly recommended viewing!"	6
This wheel stop is great for keeping the RV trailer from rocking back and forward when walking around inside.  This is a must-have for travel trailers.  I bought two of these; one for each set of tires.  As one reviewer said, you may need to tighten them up a bit after a few days.  Measure the diameter of your tires first and the space between your tires before ordering.  This device comes in two sizes.  Built very sturdy and they are light in weight.  Need I say more.	2
I just received these socks yesterday. So I went for a long walk today. 5 miles out in the country. The socks felt great in my walking shoes. I had to kind of rush for the last 2 miles to get home for my son, so I put the speed on. The socks even felt good at a good clip. They are nice and soft and cushy, yet they do not feel bunchy in the shoes. Overall a great sock. I will try them with hiking boots as soon as I can.	8
Love gameboys. Ive had a gameboy pocket, advance, and advance sp. I should have bought another sp just because of the backlight. Other than not being bright the gameboy color is good. It is a nice size and very durable. I would suggest getting collectible or one with the battery cover. Mine was a little dirty but i'm sure i can clean it off. Very nice and love the blue color. It lasts longer on batterys than rechargeable. But i have rechargeable AA's so it isn't a problem.	23
I like this little cooker.  It comes with very good detailed instructions for cooking various foods.  The instructions addressed questions we had without having to do further research.  I would recommend this.  Keep in mind that you do not use the entire 6 QT so buy a larger one if you need to make 6 QT of food.  The cooker can only be about half full for some items and two thirds full for other times.  I will check those line markers and update if I got it wrong.  20130130.	13
I played the game of frustration everytime I had to change a crib sheet......which became much more often after more blow outs and spitting up began!  I knew I wanted to keep the bumper and searched the internet to find a solution.  This was the first recommendation to pop up with rave reviews!  I tried one out and absolutely loved it! Changing sheets is a breeze!  They stay one very well too.  I liked it so much I ordered another to have as back up.  Highly recommended if you are done lifting that dang mattress up!	3
We gave this to our 27 month old for Christmas as her first jigsaw puzzle. The box is colorful,durable and easy to carry.  The pieces are the perfect size for her hands. The puzzle has the animals she likes to name. She is too young yet to stay committed to the puzzle, but I have high hopes this will be a favorite in a few more months. Our 5 year old did it easily for her, so I think the right age is probably 3 -4 on this where it is a challenge, but doable.	22
This is a fun app.  It has helped me figure out what Wi-Fi's are available around my house and while traveling.  It is fascinating to ride in a car (don't do this while driving!!!) and watch the various Wi-Fi networks come and go.  What blows my mind is that at work there are at least 3 at any one time.  I work in a huge building that has no work related Wi-Fi, so this means people must have hot spots near me.	1
William Dalrymple has a great writing style and a deep apetite for understanding the historical and cultural context. He neither takes the clinical distant approach to his subjects neither does he use a patronizing attitude to India. If you have been to Delhi, the book will be  a great  reading; if are planning to go there, it should be required reading. You  will enjoy your trip so much more. Even if you don't go to Delhi, it is  just a wonderful reading. Olivia has done a great job in her illustrations.	5
I've reviewed these Kreg screws in different sizes with the same results.I've used these screws with my Kreg jig with good results. I've had no breakage, although I have experienced stripping out of the wood when driving them carelessly at top speed. I've used them primarily in pine, poplar, and birch, so I can't comment about other wood types like oak, ect. The cost of these screws decrease significantly when purchased in larger quantities. For my needs, they work perfectly...I would recommend them.	21
I got this train for my 8 yr old. It was originally a xmas present but came too late. Her initial reaction was &quot;Is this all?&quot;, but after they started playing with it-they played for hours! It does suck the battery juice but it can be run on auto as well. It also doesn't corner well,it gets hung up. but we have not had any problems with it not climbing hills &amp; have even gotten it to pull up to 8 cars.For the money,I thought it was well worth it.	22
I bought this microphone to further enhance my Rock Band experience.  I was not disappointed.  It kept in tune well (which was a problem I saw with other microphones) and was light enough to not be a burden of any kind.  I don't mind that it is not wireless, since I wouldn't move around much anyways.  Also, the fact that it doesn't have buttons didn't bother me, mainly because I don't mind using a controller to navigate.  I do think it could have been packaged better, but I don't fault the microphone for it.  Overall, a very simplistic, yet functional, design that works well.	23
When you move, your Wi-Fi modem just might be having problems because everyone in your neighborhood is on the same channel.  WiFi Modems use channels like Walkie Talkies, and when there are too many on the same channel, your WiFi Devices have a hard time reaching your modem.  This little gem will tell you who is on what channel, and what channels are not being used so that you or your internet provider can change the channel to one that is not being used, and you can enjoy delay free streaming!	1
"These 21 music videos in this dvd, are classic 1980's music videos at their best. Annie Lennox is not only beautiful, but she is an excellent lead vocalist. The portrayal of these music videos are awesome. Annie is fantastic. I love all of them, but some of my favorites include: ""Sweet Dreams"", ""Here Comes the Rain Again"", ""There Must Be an Angel"", ""Sisters are doing it for Themselves"" (with Aretha Franklin), and ""Missionary Man"". These videos are just as good now, as they were back in the 1980's. Thanks!!!!"	6
I can totally see why this game was endorsed by Mensa. I bought this for my 5-year old's birthday and we just opened the box. The pieces are very nicely made, and feel high quality. It took some time teaching my son how to play the game, but he eventually picked up the basics. While it is a simple concept, there are definitely strategies that can be enacted to make this game more complicated and technical than it looks. For this reason, I believe that it would be enjoyable for a range of ages, from 5 to 100+.	22
This app is cool. It has a list of a ton of different tech sites which are all there to select from and view. I got the app for free, not sure if I would have paid for it, since it's all basically free content anyway, but I'm a tech guy so I like having everything there at my fingertips to look through in one place. It's a good app, and considering that I got it as part of the free app a day offer, I'm quite happy with it.	1
"I typically use pavers I have in the yard to chock both sides of one tire when I do any work on my truck, but they aren't much higher than 1-1.5"".  These are nicer to keep in my garage than to bring in a muddy paver.  Since it's yellow, it's easy to spot in my garage, and they don't slip.  I've tested them by giving my truck a little gas while these are on and they prevent me from rolling.  They look good and do their job.  I like em...."	20
This was my first time using a block plane and I have nothing but praise for Stanley this time around. Product was in perfect condition. Though not ready to use out the package, I definitely understand the use of a block plane is a form of art and needs precision adjusting. Well, adjustment to my needs was simple and took only a few minutes. Instructions were not necessary.Used this to remove almost a quarter inch from a 2ft section of 2x4. Worked perfectly, now i'm perfectly FLUSH! I will have this sturdy plane for a long LONG time.	21
These are for my Son in law who is more than I could have wished for my daughter and grand children. As a tip, here is how I use the locking OXO Tongs I have many sizes. you lock them down then use them while they are locked you can turn chicken, hot dogs, steak ,and almost anything else without unlocking them thus you do not have to fight with the spring from completely open until just enough to pick up a hotdog. Use the locking tongs while they are locked it is much easier.	13
I was displeased with a somewhat poor-quality strap I was using before.  It just didn't seem to want to hang on, so I went ahead and decided to buy a replacement.This is what I chose, and notably, I chose it for the color, just simply because I thought a white strap would look nice on a red and white guitar.So far, it's given me no problems, and it looks very nice and functions perfectly.  This is a great bargain, too, since it's certainly not an expensive accessory.	16
I've had 2 of these now for 3 years and they work really well.  The range is not quite 41 feet, but that's probably due to my water pressure. i'd say its closer to 30 at most.  another impact sprinkler i have goes a few feet further, but it's not the biggest deal.  The positives about this are that it's very solid- i've never had a problem with it not operating properly, and it seems to spray the area very effectively. Considering that they're going on 3 years now, i'd buy them all over again with no hesitation.	18
This is a great pre-seasoned griddle, I make perfect pancakes and crepes everytime.  I usually add a teaspoon of vegetable oil before cooking to keep the surface extra slick although I probably don't need to.  Making crepes is as easy as making soup from a can.  Be aware that the handle gets hot so keep an oven mitt close by and follow the cleaning instructions, you don't wash this with soap or stick it in the dishwasher. This is one of the few lifetime purchases you can get for under 20 bucks.  So cheap I'm going to buy another one.	20
I've had 7 OES, and they are notorious for quirky digestion, manifested by loose stools, and hard to control diarrhea.This food and the Merrick Farms dry food are the only foods I've found that totally eliminate digestive problems  I would not have believed it, but this food actually produces stools so dry that they literally break apart and disintegrate upon striking the ground!  Amazing food.  Dogs love the taste, and it's reasonably priced.  I've used Solid Gold, Wellness, and many other brands.  If you want solid stools in your dogs, and excellent health, try this.	19
I got this for around $30, and it works really nice. My only complaint would be my ear starts feeling sore after wearing it for awhile, and like another reviewer said, it is light enough that it feels like it might fall off sometimes. My husband who is a truck driver said he couldn't hear through it over the noise of the truck, but I can use it and hear through it in my car just fine. It would have been good if it came with a car charger too, but thats just wishful thinkin :)	7
I just got it today and haven't spent too much time with it yet. It sounded OK and I like the features on it. I especially like not having to step down hard on the toe to engage the pedal. As soon as you press down it's on. Lots of adjustments so I'll be tweaking for a while to find my sound, but it seems like it's going to be OK. It's a lot different from my crybaby so there will be a little learning curve. For the money It's a great pedal.	16
If this app were free, I'd probably give it 3, maybe 4 stars if it supported Android 3.0.  For $3?  It's lucky to get even 1.They seem to have left out a number of places, like IHOP (they have Denny's, though), Taco Johns, Papa Murphy's and Golden Corral (though they have Old Country Buffet).It also just displays nutritional info, but it lacks the ability to put together a whole meal and get a total of all those numbers.There are free apps that do a much better job of calorie counting than this one.	1
I'm 23 now, got the game when it first came out when I was around 12. Still the bet snowboarding game of all time. So much fun that I still get the n64 out here and there simply to play this game. Has a time attack mode, trick mode, racing series, and a mixture of them all. Just a great classic that rates up their with 007 Goldeneye for classic N64 games that could last forever for those every now and then gamers like myself. Great game...that's highly reccomended.	23
The first double album in hip hop history is well worth the purchase.  This album is considered by many hip hop fans as a classic.  Shakur was out of jail and hungry in the studio.  He did not disappoint.  This album changed the game in 1996 and established Shakur as a powerful artist in music regardless of genre.  Production is flawless.  The last two or three songs on the 2nd CD were not as potent as the other tracks; however, one cannot deny that this is a true hip hop classic in every sense.  A must have for the collection!	9
I've been using these in my HP 1610 inkjet printer and they work great.  Text and photos come out crisp and vibrant.  I downloaded the template from Avery and it works perfectly in OpenOffice.The best thing about these is that they are pre-folded.  This provides a much better result than using regular card stock.My only complaint, which is minor, is that I wish the paper was just a little bit thicker/heavier.  Other than that, I'm very happy with the overall quality and will probably order another box when this one is used up.	17
I ordered the 32K, per size charts... I think the cups run smaller then the size chart states.The bra is made of a rough material, it rubbed my armpits and cleavage raw after only a few hours.The under-wires poked threw after the second wearing. I only hand washed it.The stitching and seems show threw even heavy tee-shirts...The stretchy straps are a bad idea for large breasts...Overall I am not impressed with the quality of this product. I would not recommend it to women with large breasts.	8
FIVE stars for excellent coffee and ease of use.  I use the sink sprayer and have no trouble rinsing grounds out of coffeemaker.  I have bought two for my use in our two homes and given two as gifts.  Fresh ground coffee is the best!  If you are going to buy this grinder, be sure to buy the gold-toned metal filter.  Paper filters change the taste of the coffee.June 2009 - This lasted two years and I would buy it again if this item had not been discontinued by the manufacturer.	13
I have only recently started using this product. I didn't want to build a fence to keep rabbits out of my flower beds, so I decided to try this product. So far we are seeing good results. This seems to be a good inexpensive alternative to pricey unattractive fencing. This product is very easy to use, I really like the battery powered sprayer. No pumping or mixing, just squeeze the trigger, walk and let the spay do its job. Try this product before purchasing a fence for your gardens.	18
I am going to echo everyone who says that this cd hasn't left their player. Being someone that changes her cd every few songs it is rare for me to keep one cd replaying over and over. I love the combination of Lacey's sweet childlike voice mixed in with some well crafted hard rock notes. I had been going through  some down times in my life and this cd is just what I need. The lyrics and music really relate to my issues and help to find serenity in my faith. I recommend this everyone. A+	6
Have used this Homeopathic gel for decades. As a professionally trained Modern, and Classical Ballet, dancer for over 30 + years, I have sworn by this for preventative as well as helping to speed-up recovery/healing time of sports-type & over-use injuries. Ii is essential to us dancers and athletes alike. Great for contusions, bruises and over-use injuries. Recommend. Only remember to remove all oils and perfumes from skin BEFORE using, and to be diligent enough to use in the morning and evening both. for best results.	12
I first discovered Stevie on Austin City Limits. I was just blown away by his playing and singing.  I don't think I have ever viewed such a passionate player - Body and Soul.  There is not one wrong note -- it's complete bliss.  I was lucky enough to see him about four months before he passed, and it was the most fantastic musical experience of my life.  I remember it like it was last week.  He played with everything he had and it was beautiful.  I've been listening to him for years and I never get tired of him.	6
"Walked into my favourite record shop to see what stuff has been re-issued, as I love my 70's and 80's.  My eye's lid up to see a ""Siouxsie & The Banshees"" greatest hits sitting on the shelf.  My hand races out to pick it up in full anticipation of finding my favourite punk tune on there; ""spell bound"", and ugh!, I couldn't believe it.  This group finally releases a greatest hits here in Australia, and the best song is not even on it.  As good as a hot chocolate in winter, without the chocolate??."	9
"So many ""thinking"" games these days cost big bucks, but not SET!  It is basically a pattern recognition game, but MUCH more fun than ""pattern recognition game"" sounds.  My family loves to play SET, and, as others have noted, five year olds can play on a par with adults.I also love the portability of the game - it's good wherever you have to wait, the dentist, the Drs. office, etc...And I also love the fact that you can lose cards and STILL play the game.  Our deck is probably 5 cards short but still going strong.I highly recommend this game."	22
"""Echoes"" is the seventh episode of Joss Whedon's ""Dollhouse"" and it has, to me, a different feel than the previous episodes. I strongly recommend you watch these in order since the back-story and plot lines build from episode to episode.No plot spoilers from me: The main story involves a dangerous situation on college campus that requires the use of most of the ""Actives"", except for ""Echo"". Still, ""Echo"" manages to be central to the plot and we learn a lot more about her back story. This was an odd episode that shows us a different side of the ""Dollhouse"" residents.Recommended!CFH"	0
I've had this model of vacuum for 8 or 9 years, and when I decided to purchase another for my business I ordered it through amazon.It arrived in a box with ZERO protective packing.  Not a bit of foam or cardboard.  Not a single bubble of bubble wrap.Guess what?  It was damaged.  The hose intake plastic flange was shattered.  I'm sure the return policy is great--blah blah blah.  But it's a hassle and I really needed the product when it arrived.So great vacuum, BUT I strongly advise against using Amazon to purchase it.-Steve	21
I actually ordered this whisk because the first one I bought is always in the dishwasher.  This is the whisk I grab for everything, gravy, batter, marinades, eggs, etc.  I have a larger whisk that also works well but just doesn't fit the hand as well.  With the shape of the handle and rubber texture this whisk has the perfect feel for every meal use.  I will probably end up buying a third as these two I now own will always be in the dishwasher.	13
Ian Anderson's 1st solo album,well what's so different about that, virtually every Tull album since Mick Abrahams departure is an Ian solo album. Of course this had to happen in the early 80's when everyone made their stinky synthesizer robot boy album and this one's no exception. Like The Human League with a flute player. Very Un-Tull, so was Under Wraps; at least 'A' had Eddie Jobson, chops a plenty, and still a nod or two to the more earthy past. Pass on this one please!	9
My daughter was born 3 & 1/2 weeks early and had to stay at the hospital for a week, she was lazy at the breast but did great with these bottles which came highly recommended by a friend.  I only have an ocassional problem with leakage when you twist it shut it seems that every 1 in 10 times it leaks.  I don't mind the leaking except that it takes several tries to re-twist it before it stops leaking.  I hate losing precious breastmilk to leaks, thats why I gave it only 4 stars.	3
This is an item I purchased based on reviews.  I barely looked at any other splitting axes.The reviewers were right.I am new to splitting, but watched some videos to learn.  This is a solid axe, yet the lightweight handle gives a great balance and reduces fatigue versus heavier, wood versions.  I have a lot of Fiskars tools so I know their plastic-composite is incredibly strong.  They also have a great warranty.In short, if you use this axe how you are supposed to, you will not have a problem splitting logs.	18
I have a 4.5 month old and these newborn nipples are too fast for my breastfed baby. He guzzles a 4 ounce bottle in less than 5 minutes, which is HORRIBLE for a breastfed baby. He doesnt know when hes full and ends up spitting up a ton after feeds. He also ends up with an upset tummy and is extra gassy because of them. Since this is the slowest flow Avent offers, Ive had to look for new bottles. I wish they made slower flow nipples because I really do like the bottles.	3
I've been using these with my Pony Pipe Clamps for over ten years now. My originals are still working great and have never cracked, hardened or otherwise deteriorated like so many plastic parts do. Hopefully this newest set will perform as well. I recently expanded my pipe clamp collection and wouldn't be without these pads. It saves a lot of time not having to maneuver makeshift blocks between the clamp and the work piece. I've tried a few of the imported clamps and keep coming back to these old standards.	21
I was given these one time when I was in the hospital, remembered them and now i keep them on-hand for home use.  They really do clean you up,  have a pleasant smell, are soft and comfortable easy to use, and are great for when someone can't get in the bath or shower due to injury or illness.  I found ideal for camping and although you couldn't microwave them, I found you can warm them up with warm water either in a closed package or individually.	12
I have solo shucked many dozen's of holiday oysters in my day and know my way around a shucking knife. Of the several I own, this is my second favorite. Oxo is generally a reliable kitchen accessory manufacturer and for occasional use, it's not too shabby. I do prefer a heftier blade, the Oxo is pretty bent up, but it does work. For a perfect oyster shucking knife, take a gander at the one sold by Island Creek Oysters in Mass...also a great source of the little salty delights too.	13
Greatest soap ever! I love how clean it makes me feel and the tingles I get from the peppermint! It is very refreshing! If you ever read the label on the outside there is a lot of crazy stuff on there like different ways to use the soap even using it as toothpaste.Pretty crazy.We love this soap though!Seriously the best soap!Try this soap if you have not already. That alone will convince you how awesome it is.BTW IT IS TOTALLY WORTH THE PRICE! You only need a small amount of the product so it does last a very long time.	20
"Stevie Wonder, as a composer, singer, and musician was simply at a creative peak during the 70's. I would recommend anything he put out during that decade.'Songs in the key of life' is one Stevie's most accessible, and at the same time innovative albums. Like the albums that came before it (innervisions, talking book, etc) SITKOL strikingly combines an optomistic driving groove with some of the sharpest social and political criticism you will find in popular music.Some of the better known tunes are ""sir duke"", 'I wish', 'isnt she lovely', and 'as' - but the other tracks are all good!"	9
Though it was his second studio album, it contains so many classics that it could be called a greatest hits album.  &quot;Radio Radio,&quot; &quot;This Year's Girl,&quot; &quot;The Beat&quot; and &quot;I Don't Want to Go to Chelsea&quot; were some of the top songs of the new wave.  They sound just as full of spit and vitriol today as they did almost a quarter century ago.  It was amazing to hear Elvis finally do &quot;Radio Radio&quot; on SNL, backed up by the Beastie Boys!  If you're wondering when Elvis was actually &quot;cruel,&quot; listen to this masterpiece!	9
Avery makes excellent labels that do what they claim. They're high-quality and stick to what you put them on -- in this case, packages or envelopes. I'm taking away one star because they're harder to use in the printer than they should be. It's always a trick figuring out which way to orient the sheet and get it set up to print properly. Granted, part of that is my own fault. But these should be easier to use. However, overall it's a fine product.	17
Acoustic Pink Floyd?!  Is it worth it?To a large degree, yes.  Gilmour plays a rather intimate show featuring some Floyd, some solo work, a couple of Syd Barrett's tunes, a cover or two or three, and a surprisingly good song from guest Richard Wright.  Excellent 5.1 sound and a few bonus features.It may not satisfy all of the Pink Floyd fans chomping at the bit for &quot;Pulse&quot; to be released on DVD (AND JUST WHEN CAN WE EXPECT THAT?!  GET ON THE BALL, WHOEVER YOU GUYS ARE!), but it is an interesting and satisfying consolation prize for the rest of us.	6
Bought this to recharge my riding Lawn Mower battery. It has not been run during the winter as my grass is dormant. I tried to start it the other day and it just would not start. It sounded like the battery was getting weak. So I purchased this at a reasonable price and tried it. It charged the battery over night and now it starts just fine. Easy to use. You can leave it attached and after charging the battery, it will switch to the &#34;trickle&#34; mode, keeping the battery charge topped off.	2
This drill is an absolute work horse.  Besides doing lots of hole drilling in different materials, I've used this drill to mix thinset mortar, grout, and joint compound....it just churns away and barely gets warm.  After burning up two Dewalt drills, I decided to go with Milwaukee.  The keyed chuck is the best on the market and you never need to worry about it slipping once you've secured it properly.  The drill has a lot of torque, so use the additional handle and hold on tight!  Great drill....great price!	21
This is a nice wallet until you put a 'few' cards in it.  The card holder inside is made of leather type material and when you add just 8 cards (which includes the drivers license, library card, 2 medical cards, AARP and towing cards-no charge cards) it becomes so bulgy that where it snaps the space is approx 1 1/2 inches apart and will grow if more cards are added.  Sorry to say, I have gone back to my old wallet as this one just does not work out for me.	8
The only reason I rated it with 4 and not 5 stars is because I ordered one and had to get it replaced because it wasn't working within a couple weeks. However, the most recent one, I've had for months and it's still going strong.  Charges much faster than the other chargers I've ordered over the years.  That circle shines a bright blue light, which is kind of neat, but a little distracting in the car at night.  But over all, quite good.	7
I recently purchased this Fobus Double Mag holster.  I'm currently deployed and use this Mag holster do house 2 9mm double stack mags for my Beretta M9 (92FS).  I've never had problems with Fobus products and I was just as pleased with this one.  A feature I like is the material they place on the inner portion of the Holster.  It's rubber like, allowing the holster to better grip to the wearer.  Retention could be slightly bette, but I havn't had any problems with Mags falling out.  It is, afterall, a multi-use mag holster.	20
"I was so taken by this story when I first started reading it that I told my Mom about it, suggesting that she would love it. I was almost finished with the book when my Mom passed away. When going through her things, I found a copy of ""Water for Elephants"", and it really hit me hard emotionally, much like Jacob's feelings when his parents died (my Mom died from a neural hematoma after slipping on a step ladder). Now, almost five years later, I was able to bring myself to finish reading this wonderful tale, and I am so glad I did."	5
This was a great series with good acting and true to the time period. London Hospital was ahead of it's time as far as treating the sick and injured. It was fascinating to see how people were treated and that the hospital opened at 8am with patients lined up at the gate. London Hospital pioneered new treatments and procedures while treating the poor. I loved that they smoked in the operating rooms while working on patients as the patients drank a cup of tea!  If you like history and medicine you should watch this series.	0
I love all things ginger, so my opinion may be a bit biased. Fresh ginger is a favorite of mine because of the spicy, astringent bite it has. This tea reminds me of that, although the spicy bite is probably due to the black pepper added. I've tried other ginger teas, lemon ginger teas, green ginger teas - they all seem to have a dry/dull ginger flavor, and I always come back to this one. I love this tea with a dash of honey. It's sweet and spicy and gingery goodness.	11
One of my favorite peel-off masks. A treat for my face. Exfoliates/peels and leaves my skin feeling super clean and soft. It's gentle on skin but cleans effectively.  The cucumber mask feels great in the hot summer months for deep cleaning and leaves my face feeling refreshed and renewed.  Dries fairly quickly and peels easily.  I use a cucumber toner after peeling off and my skin feels calmed and soothed. I have better results with moisturizing when I use this peel a couple times per week.	4
This is my favorite opera production.  I consider it to be one of the greatest ever (as did Domingo).  Occasionally there is a camera problem, but it's minor.  This is a sexy opera and the stars give it right back to us.  Yes, I prefer Freni (my goddess) than Scotto, but Scotto makes up her vocal shrillness with her incredible acting.  This is a must see for Manon lovers and I can't wait to see it next year live at Seattle Opera.Enjoy, friends!	6
This movie may have had reviews but I liked it fine. I thought the camera handling was good, the costumes and vehicles excellently portrayed and the action fine. The story? Pretty good. I bit long but it keeps your interest. Certainly there is no depth to some of the characters but is it really necessary to get into Mussolini's head?I also loved the use of archival movie footage in this film. Some directors overdo this technique but I thought it was very well done in this movie.I was glad to get my hands on this gem. I'm sure I'll be watching it several times.	15
Noticed immediate difference. Idle is smoother, acceleration is quicker, and cruising on the highway feels assertive with much more power to be had. There was a $10 off coupon for a long time and with prime so I could not refuse. I cannot wait to drive my car again. I feel like Mobil 1 is a brand that does not need to heavily advertise because their product is so good already. It is a trusted brand and your engine is being protected without any second guesses! BMW, Benz, and the GTR use this so why can't yours?!	2
Beginning with &quot;The first six words I'll teach my pup are 'dig a hole' and 'fill it up.'&quot;  this book is absolutely hilarious.  I had never heard of it before my son came along, but it is one of his favorites  and mine.  It is whimiscal, clever, and just plain fun:  &quot;have a care,  don't paint the mayor.&quot;  The cadence and flow of the words are  masterful.This nugget will surprise you.  I hope you enjoy it.	5
This kit is really cool.  It comes with little tracer designs and a backup LED light so you can place all your parts where you want them and then trace your design.  Then you can finish up with cool colors, accents, details, etc.  You can make anything from a family SUV-type to a racecar to a Bug to everything in between.  My kid spent days taking personal requests and then lovingly designing a custom car for everyone in the family.  The final results are very high-quality too!  I definitely recommend this pack.	22
For quite some time, I have been using different types of hot sauce on different types of food.  Before I started doing this, I only ever remember using hot sauce on barbeque sandwiches.  Even though I have tried numerous types of hot sauce during this period, Tabasco Brand Garlic Pepper Sauce has set itself apart from the others.  It has a satisfying flavor--I especially like its saltiness and tanginess.  Also, it is neither too hot nor too mild.  This is a recommendable product.	11
The guy around the house swears by this razor. (If a good razor gets him to shave, I am all for it.) Many men have sensitive skin and an adjustable blade means that they can get a comfortable shave --a big plus here at home. The heads are washable, and over time, if they need replacement, the top flips out and the elements can be replaced with new. The charge lasts long enough for trips away from home for several weeks without bringing a charger. What more could you want? It's worth every penny.	12
Unreliable and hard to clean.I took full advantage of the warrantee on this coffeemaker. With a only 6 months of service, the grind mechanism bound and couldn't be removed. Cuisinart replaced under the warrantee (I did have to pay shipping charges!) Less than a year later a repeat performance. Again, I paid shipping and Cuisinart replaced the machine. Well you know what happened!  The third one just went in the trash as the warrantee expired two months ago.The machine was always difficult to clean - so know I am online to look at Melita's!	13
This game is lots of fun. The game-play itself really hasn't changed much even from the original title, but lots more options have been added, the cartoons are more comical and &quot;spunky&quot;, there's a lot more  choices. The worms are still their ever-cute selves. Cute new weapons like  Skunk, Bow and Arrow, Exploding Worm have been added to increase its  playability. If you want to buy one out of the three game series, make it  this one.	23
"This is the best booster seat. It ""grips"" easily to chairs and does not slide. We use it in our captains chairs and our son is great in it! It is the most durable seat too. My nephew has had one for two years or more now and it is still in EXCELLENT condition. It is soft and comfy. It may seem pricey for a booster but it is definitely worth it. It travels easy and wipes clean in a heartbeat. Grandma even bought one to keep at her house for all the kids! Definitely a must have!"	3
Ive used this app for the past few months to track my calorie intake on the Kindle Fire. My doctor told me I was underweight and wanted me to gain a healthy weight. I decided to document my daily food consumption and was shocked that there were days I didnt even get to 1000 calories. I love that you can log in online and offline, when internet access isn't possible, when using the app. Interface is simple, there are a variety of foods to choose from, even generic brands, and it has an easy receipe creator.	1
My husband is such a fan of hot sauces, I can't believe he even has any tastebuds left. However, this is his favorite hot sauce. People are always bringing him hot sauces from their travels, or giving him unusual ones they run across. This remains his favorite. His gasping, eye-watering, favorite! The warnings are real...do use with caution...even from picking up the (apparently clean and dry) bottle to put it back in the fridge, I've touched my lips later and noticed a burning sensation.	11
I bought this with the leather cleaner. I found it to be very good, but you have to wait for it to dry, which takes about a day. It does not stay as tacky as the leather honey conditioner which I also have bought. I feel the honey conditioner will be better in the long run, but if the leather is delicate the honey could potentially make it worse because it is very sticky and can wear the material as you rub it in. So in the long run, this is a great option.	2
Guitar World named Rush and Van Halen the top 2 albums of 2012, and it's well deserved. (as much as I hate lists, this one I agree)This is pure Rush. It reminds me of classic Rush, it's like nothing has changed. It's a reminder of why we love Rush in the first place.Rush has continued to make great music after so many years with the same lineup, that's not easy for any band.I won't go into why this album is great as so many other reviewers have mentioned already.Just listen for yourself.	6
I needed this for the newer style u-joint grease fittings (not zerks). There is no other efficient way to grease these new fittings without this injector. The picture doesn't show it , but the tip has a coating on it almost like bed lining to seal against the ball seat. I haven't tried it on conventional zerk fittings, but I don't see why it wouldn't work, especially on hard to reach/limited access fittings. I'm going to buy another one as backup since I can't find one locally.	2
I love ethnic foods and to cook them. I recently purchased another product which was a major disappointment, so I was back to the drawing board.The reviews won me over, and free shipping, so I ordered one of each, red and green. Tonight I used the green for the first time and WOW! It made me look like a gourmet international chef - it is so incredibly good!It was definitely hot, though, which is fine with me but I was glad I had the coconut milk base. This is excellent and I will keep this on hand always.	11
I think opera, as a tradition, tends to stagnate in, well...tradition. It's good that opera is also being expanded to the media of today. This for-film movie production takes all advantage that the video medium has to grant, without the limitations of a traditional filmed stage production. The acting is perfect (Domingo gets better every time I see him, and this performance tops the cake). The casting is very appropriate (Stratas is indeed the sickly prima donna!). Also, the cinematography and camera-work are the work one might expect from Hollywood, not from opera: superb!All in all, buy it for its creativity.	6
We've been giving our dog this medicine for years and its always done a good job of keeping the ticks and other things off of him.  We have found a few dead ticks in his fur, but never a live one and certainly not one head deep into his blood supply.  Applying it isn't so difficult but since our dog is white, it does leave a discoloration in his fur until his next bath.  This is what our vet recommended so we're going with it and it works fine.	19
I don't even know another sound deadner solution besides dynamat and theres proably a reason for that. I have been using this stuff on many car audio projects for years and its been great. Excellent from stopping trunk paneling from rattling down and solidifying speaker enclosures down to keeping wires bundled neatly and secure to the chassis. Always buy a bulk pack at least because the project always starts small like two speakers enclosures and next your doing the whole door outside panel and inside panel. Plus it never hurts to have extra.	2
After splitting hundreds of cords of firewood, this is the best splitting maul that I've used.  The hollow handle cuts down on the weight and the efficient design of the wedge make splitting wood much easier.  I was able to split 3-foot cedar rounds relatively easily after failing to be able to with my old splitting maul.  I use the 36 inch handle, but sometimes choke up a bit to get more force.  This is an excellent design that allows you to split wood more quickly with less effort.	18
My Mom bought me one of these from Walmart when I was in middleschool. Ive kept it ever since... Its lasted through highschool, going to summer camp, it went to college with me (I used it as extra seating and as a bed a couple of times). It made it through moving 3 times after college and the only reason it didnt deploy with me (much better than Army Toughboxes) is that it didnt have wheels. its lasted half a lifetime and still doesnt even have a strach on it. I love this thing!	13
This product works extremely well and is extremely reliable. Anyone complaining about the short cord didn't do their homework. The pictures clearly illustrate a short cord. A 12 foot cord would be ridiculous on a car mountable charger. I like to use those 9 inch lighted extension cords sold atwalmart and Amazon.com, These give you a lighted indication of power when plugged in. My charger is under hood mounted and has seen over 110 degreeswhile running highway speeds and charging in summer heat. Frankly I'm amazed it still works 5 years later. I will buy another if it quits working.	2
This Scotch high performance masking tape is super wide at nearly 1-1/2 inches, the adhesiveness is moderate (what one wants in a temporary tape). After using the tape to mask off a cabinet I was painting, the next day I easily removed the tape, with clean lines remaining.I do like the extra width of the tape, some others are too skinny and too thin. This one holds up to the job. The only &#8220;baking&#8221; I&#8217;ve done is with a hair dryer if I&#8217;m in a rush paint job.	17
These earphones are BIG!  Seriously, the picture does not prepare you for how large they are.  But, their large size helps to the be very comfortable.The sound is not as good as I was hoping.  Things tend to sound a little mushy through them to me.  But, for under $20, you won't find anything better.  Based on prior experience with Koss earphones, I'm expecting these to last a very long time.Their large size and lack of audio isolation makes them best for use in the home.  I use mine for computer games and watching movies on my laptop.	10
Received the Maxell VCR Head Cleaner and loved it. I have always been leary of the dry ones....I have previously had these that had a built in button you pushed to put the cleaner on the cleaning tape. They were a very professional way to go and I loved them. This is about as close as you can get to that. I mostly use my professional vcr to convert my old videos to dvd's so is nice to keep the heads clean so as to do a great job. I would recommend this to anyone...	10
Oh is this game good or what? It is only the best fighting game ever made! Even better then the PS2 tekkens (tekken tag and tekken 4). The graphics are good and the movies are great. The sound is good also. I love the characters and the stages. The best thing about it is that the graphics arnt as slow as 2 and 3. Besides that, the fighting style to every character is great. If this is what all fighting games are like, I want them all!	23
It didn't seem like slight difference in shape would make it almost useless. It may work well with Dunlop picks but not for thePlanet Waves 10 Standard Guitar Picks - Duralin Blue ###GT!!! Medium/Heavy, also the thicker the pick, the fewer it will hold. It has sticky back foam tape on it for mounting to a surface like your amp or whatnot. I've found it mostly not useful thus far, maybe it would help more when playing live so I can grab for a pick and know they will be there.	16
Love Keens!  And this sandal is no exception.  Purchased these for my husband and the fit and style is great. They're comfortable and rugged.  I ordered the India Ink/Rust color combo because they were the cheapest, but was so pleasantly surprised.  They look much better in person than on the website!!!  If I were looking at them in a store and had choices for the same price, I still would pick this color combo.  If you haven't worn Keens before, they're a must...	8
Very very powerful. It blows all kinds of air products in just a minute. I cut one star because it is just too much noisy. Maybe in that powerful mode it can't be lower noise. Anyway it is embarrassing if your air mattress leaks during midnight. It will wake up a few friends, let alone your family on the mattress.The battery lasts very long. It brings another side effect of heavier overall weight to other products.But I still recommend this to you. Never buy those 4 x D battery pumps.	20
Purchased at Bagram Afghanistan PX in 2007 and this watch is a must-have for anyone treking into the mountains (of which I did, alot).  Over the years the watch has taken a beating - the bezel is scratched up but, I still get a lot of comments about the watch.  The altimeter (incl the memory function) worked very well.  Battery replacement is easy (and has to occur about once a year).  The watch is a typical ABC watch, that looks good and does the job.	8
I purchased this grill, but I was surprised at how much I enjoyed cooking on it.  With the chimney starter, it is almost as fast to get this grill ready to cook as it is to get a gas grill ready - and you should let your meat set out for about 20 minutes before you grill, so you really haven't lost that much time.The ash catcher is a great feature and don't forget to get the rotisserie attachment.  You haven't had turkey for thanksgiving until you've had a rotisserie turkey!Real Men cook with charcoal and wood and this is the best grill I've ever owned.	18
"Sharp and precise pruning snips are here!  I used these pruning snips for my roses and mums.  I love the spring action handle as this was a great idea.  The tool is light-weight and the quality of Fiskars is one I can rely on.  The size is great and easy to carry with you when you have many plants to prune.  For those family members that like to borrow things and don't bring back, I labeled my snips ""Mom"" so know one can use them without my permission as I want these back!"	18
OK, I admit I have a serious, anaphylactic milk allergy. But after reading the reviews here, I thought this product sounded so magically wonderful that I'd give it a try anyway.Big mistake!!!I'm out of the hospital now and back at my computer, so that part's good. And I did get a helicopter ride to a major medical center, even if I wasn't awake for it.Still, all things considered, this product was a lousy purchase. The FDA needs to put a stop to the money-grubbing corporate monsters who market this stuff. Save your money, and save your life!	11
I have mixed feelings about this category of laptop locks.  It wouldn't stop someone with a pair of good wire cutters.  It will stop the casual impulsive thief who walks by in the library.Anyway, as this particular product goes it is well manufactured and works smoothly.  I use it in the law library (where you know and trust most everyone) if I have to be up and down a lot, like when I'm doing research throughout the library.  It provides a little peace of mind in such situations.Thanks for reading	10
My Cry Baby is about 20 years old and is the oldest pedal on my board. I have rewired it for true bypass and replaced the Potentiometer to give the Wah a broader range but it really doesn't sound any better. This pedal covers the &#34;White Room&#34; by Cream Tone perfectly. I gave it 4 stars because it hasn't been maintenance free. The pot came loose and the switch had to be replaced but considering the fact that it survived several hundred gigs in smoky dives, I probably should give it 5.	16
Back in 1987 I went to my local movie theater to see CREEPERS,the then latest from italian horror filmmaker master Dario Argento.I enjoyed the film,muddled it was plot-wise.I bought the soundtrack lp and that's about it.Flash forward to 2002,I'm looking through the videos at amazon,and,HEY!The uncut and restored CREEPERS back in it's european form-PHENOMENA!I don't have a dvd player yet,so I got the vhs version.A great print presented in Widescreen,2 music videos,a behind the scenes feature on the spfx,and Dario interviewed by Joe Franklin.Anchor Bay rocks!	15
James Taylor is such a brilliant songwriter, singer and performer, and he is one one of the few artists who has remained on top year after year. I am not speaking about the charts and selling the most records, but about performance. Listen (and look) to this excellent performance! All the classic songs are here, some of them sounding even better than on the original recordings. The musicians are in good mood and totally inspired by James and his songs. The perfect DVD when you need inspiration! (...)	6
Take a chance and read this book.  It is wonderfully written.  Such an interesting book to take the lead character and having him in a nursing home, thinking of his life... and what a great life.  What a heart warming story.  I'm fascinated by the freakish carnivale life, and this didn't disappoint (but uphold) that theory!  If you're in for an uplifting tale of struggle and happiness in an unexpected way, you've found the perfect all-around book.  Enjoy!	5
My son is now working on his second book - after last year's success, we will be doing a book every year (he's 6 now).  The book takes time to do properly, and certainly needs an adult's help at this age, but the end result is more worthwhile than virtually any other gift he's gotten.  The look on his face, seeing his name and story and pictures put together in the beautifully bound book...  I'll never forget it, and I never have to.  It happens every time he reads HIS book!  Highly recommended	22
I needed to extend the length of the reach of the charge controller in my solar panel system setting, and after checking the prices of the extensions for sale, I decided to make my own.I bought these to cut in half and use at the end of the wires. These work so good that soon I'll be ordering more, because I'm planning to build a battery bank, and using these will lower the cost for sure.Also, they are easy and secure to disconnect and reconnect to the different component within the solar panel system setting.	2
I like this product a lot, but was very excited to receive it to apply on my 5 month old who is starting the whole teething process... the product vibrates great, the colors are attractive to her, and as soon as she sees it its the first thing she wants to grab. However, its a little heavy for her and in order to make it vibrate I have to hold it because it requires more strength than her tiny mouth has at the moment. Hopefully as she becomes stronger she can use this product better. But overall I really like it.	3
On a scale of 1-10, this Jane Eyre is a 5, maybe 6.While Ciaran Hinds and Samantha Morton are talented performers, this version is just overall lacking. Ciaran Hinds come off as a little too brutish for my taste and certain parts are rushed through.While one cannot expect a 2 hour movie to encompass every detail of a novel, it is expected that the production team keeps to original novel to a certain degree, which is not the case with this one.A better JE is the 1974 Michael Jayston/Sorcha Cusick JE, the 1983 Timothy Dalton/Zelah Clark JE or even the 2006 Toby Stephens/Ruth Wilson JE.	15
Jon Sykes, Jon Sykes, Jon 'Effin' Sykes!!! His guitar work on this CD is absolute ball buster! If I only liked the track Still of The Night this disc would still be worth it but Sykes slashes and burns throughout the disc. And his guitar tone is monster! And I say this as a drummer, not a guitar player, that's how impressive Sykes is. You wanna hear some fierce guitar work then this CD is the real deal. Air guitar alert!![...]	9
I am one to always have and use a lot of features. I like the Razr and would recommend it. Positives: light weight, small size, speaker phone works well, display is easy to see, voice dial is accurate, bluetooth, and it is great conversation piece. Negatives: Speakers (normal and speaker) not as clear sounding as my Nokia 6600, no IR port, has a USB port but not software to use it - even for charging the phone, battery life a little short, video recording time way too short, difficult to find a name in the address book (a lot of keystrokes!).	7
"All 3 of our dogs love the various vitamin-enriched ""tasty pastes"" available through Kong.  Although they loved to chew on their Kongs before, we found that they really got into it once we started inserting some of the paste into the Kong cavity.  All of them go nuts when we put down the ""pasty Kongs"" for them to enjoy - and enjoy them they do!I would highly recommend all of Kongs' ""tasty pastes"" - it's easy to use, doesn't seem to make a mess, and is a great extra treat for dogs.  Our 3 give it ""2 paws up""!"	19
This is a good durable hose, that is to say, it is exactly what you would expect. It does not tangle but be aware that it may twist or kink, which can be frustrating. Make sure you lay it out before attaching it to air or else it becomes difficult to work with. The 1/4 inch connectors are pretty standard and allow for connectors to screw on as one would hope and expect. This hose will probably not change your world, unless you are using one of those cheap plastic coil hoses, in which case it might.	21
I own five or six Bob Marley dvds, and they all have shoddy audio and video workmanship...which really takes away from the excellent performances. This video is absolutely top notch; the audio and video qualities are excellent, and I would highly recommend it to anyone who appreciates reggae music. This video looks as if it was produced a couple of years ago, and that's saying a lot - when you consider how old this performance is. This is one of my favorite videos, and it's a mainstay in my weekend rotation. Buy this one...you will truly be impressed.	6
FIT TOO SMALL FOR ME, I'M A SIZE 34 WAIST. I GOT THE LARGE AND IT WAS 36-39. NOT GOOD. I RE-ORDERED AND GOT THE MED. 32-34. AND IT WAS WRONG AGAIN, IT WAS A 31 WAIST, SO IF YOUR A SMALL GUY WAIST 29, GET THE MED. IF YOU'RE A REG GUY GET THE LARGE AND HOPE IT SHRINKS IN THE WASH. THE PANTS ARE EXCELLENT, I KEPT THE LARGE AND WILL WASH TILL IT SHRINKS, THEY SHOULD BE PERFECT THEN, THANKS.	8
I use these filters in my Bio-wheel that I have on my 30 gallon bowfront. This company makes outstanding filters that help keep your fish healthy and your tank cleaner. I have a 6 year old black ghost knife fish and some breeding cory cats in my tank, and I have never had poor water quality or disease thanks in part to this filter. I wish I could get my knife fish into a bigger tank, but even though I can't he at least has great water quality thanks to this product.	19
I have been buying and using this product for several years and swear by it. I thought I had found a great place to order it from Amazon. Unfortunately, the seller sent me a cheaper version of the product and my attempts to contact them were ignored.  So, I'm returning it. It doesn't seem that hard to me to tell the difference in 2 a day Triple Strength and 4 a day regular strength. I guess they thought I wouldn't notice the difference. I paid for a 2 month supply and got a l month supply.	12
I switched from Tetra to Penguin a while ago, and really appreciate the all-in-one design of these. While I'm sure there integrated plastic backing isn't all that great for the environment, I certainly do not miss having to rebuild filter media every few weeks. It's just pull-out and drop-in, or sometimes I'll just spray the gunk off of the blue side and use that for a while. I've never had a problem with water &#34;poking through&#34; these filters like I did with the others. The convenience is appreciated.	19
For making square pieces (doors, frame panels, boxes, etc) these clamps are the best.  The jaw faces stay parallel to each other, which helps keep everything lined-up and the plastic does not mar the wood.  At 50&quot; they are great for large pieces.Any wood glue that squeezes out of the joints does not stick to the plastic nor the metal.These clamps will stand on the floor on their back without any other support.  You can also clamp up panels and stand them up and the clamps are stable that way too!They are a few dollars more, but definitely worth it.	21
This pump says it's rated for only occasional use, but I used it every day for six months.  The main thing I like about this pump is the ability to use it in any situation.  My husband and I traveled quite a bit with our son and I was able to pump in the car with the battery pack.  I use it so much that I doubt it will make it to our next child, but it's much better to buy this one twice for $80 than to buy one for $350!	3
I have tried tons of mascara, yet I always come back to this one.  This mascara is amazing.  I almost NEVER get clumps, the brush is PERFECT so I never end up with thickly caked lashes and the mascara is thick enough to coat each lash and not coat groups of lashes in to one bulky mess.  I just love it!  I just wish Amazon carried more of the brownish shades of this mascara... I would highly recommend this mascara to anyone.  I've been using it for about 15 years now and have never found a decent alternative.	4
Whether you are a lover of psychological thrillers or just gritty action packed ones Luther provides enough for both. The character is the epitome of HUMAN and SUPERHUMAN in the same breath. I've not seen a show in a long time that portrays all the cracks and faults of being a human being and yet show the strength and conviction of a super hero in one person.You love him and hate him at times but you root for him every time. Villains are multi-faceted as well. Season 3 won't arrive fast enough.	0
If you're a professional and you're JOB is music, then you may not think these mics are up to your standards in quality.  However, if you're just doing it as a hobby/side job... or even just want the mics for a PA system, then it's really hard to beat what you get in this deal here.  The deal is fantastic.  I use these for recording music at my home as well as recording my online radio show and they've been perfect for me.	16
Cloris Leachman at one of her best roles.  If church was this good I would not have a problem attending.  Lively music, Short Sermons you don't have time to sleep through, and so much more.  This film is one of the best kept secrets that Disney ever put out.  I saw it when it first came out - loved it then and still love it.  I am so happy I was able to find it here.  I even bought copies for Christmas and gave as gifts.	15
Does not kink Rolls back up easily. The auto-siphon doesnt work well via the faucet adapter if you are draining from a lower point but thats obvious - many people like to drain from both the display and refugium. I just let gravity do the work instead of adding another adapter to my faucet. The valve is nice and works well. The plastic siphon to faucet adapter is cheap but i havent seen a kit like this that wasnt cheap plastic. Bottom-line is the part that needs to work does it right, doesnt kink youll be happy with the purchase.	19
How many times have I used a magic marker to cover an old package label... lots! I was surprised and very pleased to see these labels with TrueBlock Technology! It works! A real time saver and no more ink on my fingers from the marker. Add a package of these labels to your shipping arsenal. And, if your word processing software doesn't have a template for them, you can download it from Avery's website.Once you use them, I bet you'll be sure to keep a supply on hand. Highly recommended.	17
We were getting geared up for the Winwood - Clapton tour last year and thought it would be nice to check Traffic out live. I wish I would have saved the money as this was just terrible in every aspect - poor audio, poor video and a completely un-inspired and low on talent (at the time) Steve Winwood. Catch him later on as he actually could play additional riffs on his keyboard. this was embarrasing for anyone who thinks they remember Traffic, minus Dave Mason, who WAS the heart of that band. Sorry, Jim Capaldi.	6
One of the things I look for is &#34;unique&#34; games -- games that provide something that isn't already available in dozens of other games.  (Can you say &#34;match-3&#34; or &#34;hidden object&#34;???)  Totemo begins as a very simple concept, but quickly graduates into some extremely challenging levels, all based on math and logic.  There is some &#34;background story&#34; -- though it does not affect the gameplay at all, and frankly is pretty mundane for the most part.  But anyone who likes a logic challenge should enjoy this game.	1
I have owned Mach3 razor for over 3 years now. The razor is good, but hard to differentiate its performance from Sense Excel ( I have owned that one before). Only reason I switched to Mach3 was honestly, I got bored using the same razor. The blades give normal performance, nothing out of the blue like they show on tv. It doesn't causes itching, so that the good part about the blades. However, after a month of use, for a good shave you will need multiple strokes on the same spot. Overall, decent purchase, nothing extraordinary.	12
I have had several Timex's over the years and they've all held up.  Timex watches usually outlast the bands they come with!  We bought this for our daughter who was learning to tell time in First grade.  All in all it's a good watch and she likes the look of it.  The only complaint we have is that the numbers for the seconds are really small, making it hard to read them. In a perfect world, those numbers would be a bit larger.  All in all, a great watch for a young one learning to tell time.	8
I use my rechargable batteries for just about everything. Be it remote controls, cameras,and flashlights and I haven't noticed any rapid deteriorating of the batteries. Recharging takes about 12 hrs but I keep extra just in case. The only issue I have had is the price - it keeps going up. I've seen them priced as high as $12 for the 4 pack. I have also seen them as low as $7.99 at Menards they average about $9.99. If you decide to use rechargable batteries just make sure you have extra ones for when they run down.	12
I'm glad I didn't read the reviews of this film before I saw it, as I don't appreciate to have the entire plot of a movie revealed (reviewers, please, no more spoilers!).  Fortunately, I obtained a copy of this film from Amazon[.com] before it became unavailable.  I love Faulkner, and this adaptation of one of his short stories is both profound and simple at the same time.  Stellar performances by all, including the director, in creating such a moving testament to love and loss which defines us as living human beings.  A true treasure of filmmaking.	15
This creme is super heavy duty, but tends to disappear as it soaks in.  Great for hands and feet. Being in Arizona, I am always having to apply some kind of creme to my heels and hands to combat dryness. I've run through about a dozen, high-end and low-end, but nothing works quite like the Norwegian Formula. Must be all the glycerin?I wouldn't use it on my face, obviously, but anywhere you have itchy, cracked or super dry skin, go for it.	4
I havn't played Myst yet, but I have completed this one. What an immersive game this is. Great graphics, great sound, great features to play with and great fantasy world. Riven might only be a small world, but it's well worth the visit. You even get to see some alien creatures here and there. I give this 4 stars because the puzzles were a bit too hard for a lot of gamers. It took me 3 months in all, WITHOUT HINTS I might add. If you like fantasy, puzzles and exploration. GET IT. It's worth it just for the graphics alone.	23
Avery is the name to go to in the printing world.  i looked at the on line printers and they all started off with an affordable price, but in the end, they were to expensive.  So, back to avery products i went.  This is a fantastic looking, stiff business card, for what i do... If i was needing to look like i worked for a Forbes 500 company, I would do the professional printing, but for what i use them for, it is great.	17
I've used the .60mm and .73mm Dunlop Nylon picks during my entire professional music career. I rock hard. Acoustic, electric, and Bass! I've tried almost every other pick on the market and they break far too easily. Dunlop's Nylon picks don't break, and once you find the thickness that fits your needs, you'll find that they have excellent string attack and are easily kept in grip. I rarely ever drop one of these picks while preforming. Maybe 5 times in my entire career. Buy these picks.	16
I purchased this product to whiten my teeth. I drink at least 4 cups of coffee per day and needed something to remove the surface stains. This product claimed to do better than remove surface stains from teeth but also to &#34;clean deep&#34; (what ever that means). In any case, after trying the product there was little to no significant difference.  A few weeks later I tried Crest 3D white and within in 1 week my teeth were super white and month felt fresh for hours at the fraction of what this product cost. I would not purchase again.	12
"nick drake pink moonnick drake-guitar-pianoproducerthat's all who was in the studio in the time of making this acoustic classic how can such beauty come from such raw elements i can tell you, because nick drake had talent, and he presented himself well in his vocals, his guitar playing and his lyricsyeah to some people the lyrics may sound naive and childlike but to me they are simple for a fact of getting a point across,and the instrumental horn is a superb track in a middle of a masterpieceafter you've got this get ""five leaves left""features the classic ""river man"""	9
I bought the wrong gauge. I read a review that said that you should get a size less then you really want but they are wrong. I bought the .90 gauge at Guitar Center and love them. These were made for that Dave Mustain muted crunch sound. I don't know if I will use these forever but for right now I love them. Just hard enough for speed picking but light enough to stay in your hand without moving around like 1 mils do.Dunlop Ultex sound awesome and so far they still look like new.Buy em!!!!	16
So short! My goodness! Love Fire maple games though! This one, Trapped in Wonderland, the lost City. The lost City is my favorite! That one isn't as short, &amp; really cool cause you get to play mother nature and change the seasons back n forth, can't cross the lake? No problem, just turn it to winter, so that the lake will freeze, THEN just walk across! Stuff like that is allot of fun! Thanx guys for the awesome time&amp; effort! Keep em coming! Waiting for sequels!	1
As usual J.R.Ward doesn't disappoint with this Novella of Zsadist and Bella!! The only thing that upset me was that I wished it was as long as her other Black Dagger Brotherhood books but I realize this was a Novella so I get it! I have already recommended this series to many of my friends and they love them as much as I do!!! I can't wait for the next book of this series that comes out in April...Thank you J.R. Ward for making me so happy just by reading your amazing books...You're a true talent!!!	14
So far still Made in America. I have been using formula 65 guitar polish for over 40 years since a time when my hair was longer as a hippie growing up with heavy metal. I've polished many guitars multiple times. This gets the grime and fingerprints off the body and neck keeping the instrument looking like new. It works great on acoustic and electric, solid or hollow body, acrylic or lacquer finishes without streaking. It even cleans Finger Ease lubricants off the neck and strings. I haven't needed other products separately for the neck or strings since this works great on both.	16
My son has been nail biting since before he was one year old.  He is three now and after the first week of using this product his nails are growing and look fantastic.  I have noticed in about three day this product wears off and he reverts back to the biting. Since this habit didn't start overnight, I expect it to take some time to break completely. I was skeptical before trying this product but now I strongly recommend it. I finally can see there is light at the end of the tunnel for my little nail biter.	4
Upstairs,Downstairs,1971-1975,68 episodes,5 seasons. Time period covered 1903-1930.Setting:165 Eaton Place,London,England.Favourite actress: Jean March(Rose Buck).I watched Upstairs,Downstairs on PBS in the mid 70's and again when it reaired in the 90's. This box set is worth the money. Now I can watch all the episodes and behind the scenes extras.(When I bought my set,I received the reboot of the series,2010 edition,as a bonus.Setting:1936,still at 165 Eaton Place.Jean March reprises her role. The first season was the best,the second season,2 years later,was not as good but still watchable. Jean had a stroke so she only made 2 appearances).This is the the original Downton Abbey.	15
I grabbed this app when it was the free app of the day, and it's one that's certainly worth the price. The controls are intuitive, there's variety in difficulty, the highlighting is great (which you can turn off if you want), and the way hints are done is unique- they really are hints, and not just flat out giving you answers. They've actually helped me get better at sudoku in general. I love the autopencil settings- autoerase isn't a feature I'd seen elsewhere.	1
THis is the chainsaw that always starts!  I gave away my gas chainsaws. It was the first Black and Decker 18volt tool I purchased. I Love this because I can get a lot done trimming around the farm. I have the alligator lopper and some others that I have purchased so I have batteries for extended use but the chainsaw and I usually run down and need recharging at the same time so it works well. I highly recommend this because my friends are buying them for their husbands because they are always borrowing mine for cleaning up their property.	18
I can't complain about the squirrels because I put out peanuts and corn for them so I am inviting them into the yard. But they seem content to eat corn and peanuts. They don't bother my other feeders. They are like little monkeys in the yard. I like to watch the squirrels. However this feeder still seemed like a good idea.I have had it up for a few weeks. I have black oil sunflower seeds in it. The birds hit it regularly.It looks great and seems quite durable. I have mine hung from a garden hook.	18
I was disappointed to find, that the plug in charger that you sent me, cannot be used in Australia, as it is not compatible with our amps. So I have paid for something I cannot use. I recommend that anyone wanting the plug, source it from an Australian retailer. That way you will get the correct one. I still have to charge my Kindle on the computer. This can be inconvenient. I went away for a long weekend, and had to drag my computer along just so I could charge my Kindle.	14
We needed a replacement power cord for a LCD TV. Did a bit of looking around, all of the ones we found were $10 and up, for a power cord!Not only did I find this Belkin power cord on Amazon for much less, it's a name branded, UL listed, and just a higher quality cord.After getting it out of it's package it didn't retain it's bent/wadded up form either!Pros:Cheap!UL Listed (far too many companies are using cheaper certifications).Has a good memory, i.e. doesn't stay coiled up from being packaged.Cons:Doesn't magically lower my electric bill. LOL :)	10
The other reviewers here who gave this CD three stars have valid points, and I suggest reading them before buying this. The vocals are a bit low-volume, the songs in general are a bit melancholy, and the styles kinda melting pot. Yet Ms. Krauss does have a voice of distinction and her bandmates are skilled musicians (not so much vocally, for my taste.) I haven't owned many Krauss recordings, so I can't say this is better or worse than her other releases. If you like bluegrass/contemporary country sounds, and find this at a bargain price, pick it up.	9
The amount of the plug that sticks up after inserting it into the pocket hole seems excessive.  I was envisioning just having to do a little sanding to get them flush with the work piece, not having to use a rasp to get it down to a point where I could sand it.  I wound up using a scrap block of oak, with a pocket hole, to hold them in place while I used a rasp and wood file to get them down to a manageable size, before I put them in my work piece.	21
"The collaborative work of Katherine Davis, Henry Onorati and harry Simeone, ""The Little Drummer Boy"" is delightful retelling of a classic Christmas story and song wonderfully combined with the glowing, full-color illustrations of Ezra Jack Keats and the iconic music and vocals of John Jennings in superbly produced, flawlessly recorded, six-minute DVD format. A very highly recommended addition to family, school, and community library Christmas DVD collections, ""The Little Drummer Boy"" is also available from Weston Woods in a Paperback/CD format (NPCD124, $18.95) and a Paperback/Cassette format (NPRA124, $14.95)."	15
You've no doubt heard all of the glowing reviews of this game. So here's another: the gameplay, graphics, and sound are all top-notch and leagues above all those other 3D games. There is no excuse for not owning this, even if you didn't like other Castlevania games. People should get a Playstation for this game it's so good. It's just too bad that most people will right it off because it's &quot;old-fashioned&quot;. Even worse, it hasn't sold well, so a true, 2D sequel isn't too likely to happen.	23
I 'member seein' this as a kid in Etobicoke (Toronto, Kannader) - my Dad was a missionary, so the plot was of particular poignance... He never took on the Mob, but it was fun to see that church life could be so, uh, jocular! Me'n my siblings'n folks all had a good time, and there were no 'embarrassing' moments (for me back then) in the movie where somebody was kissing, or hugging or doing anything 'intimate' that you just don't DO... particularly onscreen - Lorr-dee!	15
This product is great. When my wife & I both want to share a wired connection to an audio source, I don't have to have her continually telling me to turn it down...it's too loud. I bought this for her to turn Her's down while I enjoy it at a level I can hear. Too many years of loud music and loud guns with no hearing protection. Sometimes, it's not always &#34;convenient&#34; to used hearing protection. They didn't have those high-tech ear-plugs back in the day and a lot of us older baby-boomers have lost significant hearing as a result.	10
So, Mr. Bill is not the sturdiest of dog toys, but he's hilarious. It's a great toy to give the dog when we have company over, because his 'Oh Nooooooooooo' squeaker makes everyone laugh. Our pitbull/rotweiller beheaded Mr. Bill in a few days, but the squeaker has survived, and our dog is terrified of it. If he's doing something naughty, we pull out Mr. Bill's squeaker, and the &#34;Oh Noooooooo!&#34; stops him in his tracks. Worth the money, for sheer entertainment value.	19
Just the scent and lotion I've been looking for. Ecco Bella Vanilla is amazingly creamy and luxurious. It's gourmet lotion! I absolutely love the feel of it on my skin. It's not greasy yet it delivers fabulous moisture to dry skin. The vanilla smells heavenly. It's subtle and natural but you won't be able to stop smelling your own arms because the scent is SO intoxicating. It DOES NOT leave you smelling like a cupcake. It's a sexy vanilla scent. I will purchase more before this runs completely out.	4
Lots of tactical options, plays quickly, very flexible.  Unfortunately, to really get into the game, you have to buy at least two core sets, plus the extras like A-Wings/Interceptors, etc.  Pretty soon, it's going to cost you a couple hundred bucks to be able to field a force capable of competing in local tournaments.  If I'm going to put that much money into a game, it should be called Warhammer.Still, it's a great game and I enjoy the heck out of it.	22
"I love this novel. I started reading a printed version, but I had a hard time distinguishing character voices as it was not always marked. And then there were alternating ""young"" and then ""old"" point of view chapters. Before giving up (because I have the same type of challenge when I read Amy Tan novels), I switched to the audio ""book on tape"" and LOVED the book. One of the best novels I've read. And the voice-over talent who read the audio version is a very, very good storyteller."	5
This is a great, old-fashioned style of potato masher, which produces the type of mashed potatoes I remember from my childhood. What it has, though, that ones from many years ago did not is the OXO ergonometric design, with a comfortable handle. It also contains a hole at the top of the handle for hanging on a rack.This is excellent not only for potatoes, but for apples, carrots, various kinds of squash, turnips and other soft-cooked fruits and vegetables.The masher is made of durable stainless steel that helps you avoid rust.	13
I was looking for a Respirator to use while degreasing firearms with Brakekleen and messing around with &#34;odorless&#34; mineral spirits.Plus I have a pretty big Brain, so my brain protector is large compared to normals.  Couldn't find a size Large at any of the home improvements stores and this is only 20 bucks shipped.Great protection, did not smell any fumes at all during cleaning.  Only once I removed this respirator and was headed inside did I realize how bad those fumes could have been to me.  Awesome mask at an awesome price.Love 3M products.	2
my son loves it!i bought 4 different brands for him to try out and this is the best one!perfect shape, perfect comfort, perfect size for a 4 yr old. (potty trained now)sometimes, he sits on this for a long time....so i know it's very comfortable....LOLthe handle helps germophobic mommies. and it easy to wash too.the pee cover should be higher though as he has to hold down his thing so as not to pee all over the toilet floor.even with that, it is still a 5 star rating!	3
I work out fairly often and have a pretty good physique. I like to wherefairly tight shirts. Before I started using Certain Dri, I generally had to where baggier shirts for fear of wetness. Now I can where them as tight as I want. This stuff is awesome. I put it on every 2nd or 3rd night. On occasion it will itch a little if I put to much on, but not near enough for me to stop using it. I certainly don't recommend using it every night. It wasn't meant to be used that often.	12
This is based on a true fact of Chinese history, and John Woo, a master at film-making, has taken full advantage of computer-generated skill to present us with vast armies, flotillas of warships and - of course - one of his favorite stars, Jet Li.The film is awesome and spectacular, and no one has mastered the concept of a moving camera as well. Gone is the stationary tripod, and Woo keeps his camera hovering over and around his characters almost constantly. This is an epic winner.	0
I love this semi-sheer feminine gown with it's lovely details.  It's comfortable and elegant.  But it is too sheer to wear in front of anyone other than your husband or boyfriend.  Miss Elaine is now one of my favorite nightgown designers because they have products that are very frilly, flirty and feminine.  I ordered the large and it is a bit long for me, I'm 5 foot 4.  Other than that it fits fine and a medium would have been fine too.  sb	8
I love the blender portion.  It works great at crushing ice and other items.  The food processor is another story.  Works to chop up and blend items, but the motor noise alone has forced me to stop using it.  With each use, the noise is louder and so irritating.  I am extremely disappointed that I can't use the processor portion of it.  As much as I love the blender, I can't recommend the purchase because you won't be able to use the processor without ear plugs.	13
The brilliant Agatha Christie's &#34;Poirot&#34; and David Suchet were made for each other! They started out as great and grew into fabulous, as did Christie's characters. Suchet makes the formerly somewhat stuffy Poirot, especially as depicted in old movies, not as endearing as he is in these Masterpiece Theatre creations which make you want to invite this little man into your home and watch his &#34;little gray cells&#34; go to work. The series just gets better and better. My third wish is that it could go on forever. it is so good.	0
As I sat with my precious 4 year old granddaughter and watched this video one more time, I smiled.This is one of those movies that you share with each little one that comes into your life.Watching her eyes glow as the story unfolded brought me such joy; and listening to her trying to remember all the reindeer names brough a chuckle.How could anyone not love this classic? It will be a tresure to share with every generation.  If you have not seen it, which would be hard to believe, I highly recommend it.  Wonderful	15
This grill is wonderful!  It cooks really evenly and the lid can hang on the side of the grill while tending to the food.  The hinged grate is great for adding wood chips for flavor.  The ash catcher makes for easy cleaning of the ashes and is worth the few extra bucks.  Our grill arrived in perfect shape and was very easy to assemble.  We use it almost every night.  This grill is sturdy and heats evenly and has the Weber name behind it.  We expect to be using it for many years.	18
I was looking for something to aleive my scalp build up so that my hair will grow out again.  I tried Nioxin, and all it did was burn my scalp and make my hair feel dry and brittle.  I had tried T/Sal a long time ago without any adverse effects.  I went back to it, and I'm STILL in love with it!  No burning, itching, or other adverse effects.  (It doesn't strip my hair either!)My scalp is actually sun burnt right now and it didn't even agitate the burn when I applied it.	4
This is the BEST THANKSGIVING special around...and I am not just saying that because I am the RANKIN/BASS Historian.  The sound on this VHS is magnificent and it should be on DVD!  I have the original GAS LP Soundtrack on CD.  MAURY LAWS and JULES BASS did a wonderful job with the score.  ELBOW ROOM, sung by TENN. ERNIE FORD was part of the RANKIN/BASS off-Broadway play A MONTH OF SUNDAYS, before it was put to GREAT use in this special!  A GREAT Special!  E-mail me with any questions:  Rickgoldsc@aol.com	6
This is not a great film, but it is a good fun B Film  Miles ahead of the Village People's Can't Stop the Music.  There are some gifted actors here; Goldblum; Winger Landsburg, et. al.  And in a weirdly cheap way it has that Robert Altman multiple storylines and crossed characters, but it is fun to watch.  Some good 70's music going on here, some fun stereotypes of the disco era, but it is never mean or overly campy.  It just is what it is and that's not such a bad thing.  A good nostalgic rainy day/Sunday movie.	15
This works perfectly to fit the K3 in its amazon cover (with or without light) for added protection. The fit is snug and it is perfectly sized to put in a purse or bag. No it is not the ultimate in protection but it works excellently to store my Kindle 3 in its case and I have no complaints. If I'm going to go somewhere that it needs even more protection (I'm a bit paranoid) then I use my Borsa Bella Bag with it as well. At the current discounted price pick yourself one up as it's so easy to use! Recommended!	14
The Poirot adventures with David Suchet--which began nearly a quarter century ago and just recently concluded--are some of the best classic British mysteries on television. That they were saddled for years with crappy DVD transfers was a shame. But now you can enjoy pristine Blu Rays of the original Super 16 footage; they look fantastic. If you watch your Poirots as much as my wife and I do, you owe it to yourself to pick up the Blu Rays. It's well worth buying the shows a second time.	0
"this is one of the worst concert films ive ever seen and i own lots of them.  im a casual Police fan, never thought they were a top flight band, but i did like alot of thier songs.  whoever directed this film needs to be slapped, constant shots of the knuckleheads in the crowd and one entire song is like looking into a strobe light for 5 minutes,  you could have a seizure, seriously.  the police is an average live act at best, but this could have been a decent concert film if not for the idiotic ""production values""."	6
I used these with my first daughter 8 years ago. They are wonderful! You do not have to sit and wash bottles constantly. The baby will also have less gas since there is little to no air to contend with. The only difference with these are that they are expandable. This may make a difference for some using formula in respect to measuring differently with the expansion. I will be using them to store breast milk for when I go from breast to bottle as baby gets older so the expansion won't affect me any. I recommend these liners for everyone.	3
Light enough to be portable but heavy enough to be durable. I use this almost daily and have transported from office to office (and used it at our garage sale!). It wipes off very easy (often I just use a paper towel). I love that it turns into a table (we used it as a small table at our garage sale to display books!). I think this would be great for a teacher or real estate agent or any sort of person who makes presentations (or even in a cafe as a &#34;special&#34; of the day board).Love it!	17
Easy to mount, solid grip on guitar. Only detractor would be that, with my guitar at least, it hangs kind of far from the wall. This obviously is a factor of what you hang from it though. An acoustic would clear the wall nicely, my solid body electric sits a few inches away from the wall.Silicone coating on forks and retaining bands get a good grip on the guitar, without marring even soft wood.I very much prefer this to having it on one of the 'accident waiting to happen' stands on the floor.	16
You can&#8217;t just add tap water to the fish tank &#8211; you have to dechlorinate it. This product does just that. It works instantly, so it is very convenient. It comes in a nice little bottle with a built-in dropper. This lets you easily measure out how much you need. You don&#8217;t need a lot. I do wish that they had instructions for the amount of drops you need per gallon. It just says to use 1 tsp per 10 gallons, which isn&#8217;t appropriate if you are just doing a water change or if you have a smaller tank.	19
This griddle is well made, and built to last. Provided you take care of it, like you should for anything cast iron.Even though it is pre-seasoned, I went ahead and seasoned it again anyway. It can't hurt.This is one item that will be in my camping gear for a long time to come, and works just great. Flipped some pancakes on it one morning, and they couldn't have been better. Also made some reuben's, and it toasted each side flawlessly.If you need a cast iron griddle, don't hesitate to pick this one up.	20
I typically use dimarzio cliplocks on all my basses and electric guitars. they work very well for my needs.  however, I bought a junker bass for outdoor gigs and to play at places where i don't care what happens to the gear.  This strap is perfect for those needs. A nice nylon and the lock works wellBUTthe locking portion might be a little thick for some strap buttons. It works on the bass i use it on, but not my Gibson SG, so be aware. I would buy more of these if i needed a cheap strap.	16
After reading some poor reviews for goosenecks of 19&#34; or more, I decided to play it safe with a couple of 13&#34; gooseneck =- this way, if a longer unit is needed, I can just screw 2 together.  This is an excellent piece of hardware, very stiff and sturdy with no droop or sag.  Even when I put 2 together to come over the top of my guitar amp so I could mic it from the front, using an SM 57, and this gooseneck holds the mic absolutely still.Great buy.	16
This gold finch feeder is a blast!  These little cuties do hang upside down to feed and I find it very entertaining to watch.  There is an extra benefit to this feeder...the little holes make it just about impossible for the large birds to steal the food.  Oh yea, the feeder is made out of plastic as well as the perches, but I have absolutely no complaints in regards to the quality of the feeder for the money.  Just use common sense for leaving it out under certain weather circumstances...it cannot tolerate below freezing temperatures.	18
I love when you open a book and start reading, and you visualize yourself right there.  Not only do you see things, you can smell the aromas in the air, and you are stopped just short of touching.  You stand there witnessing the events going on around you.  You can not stop them, you can not change them, but you are feeling the feelings of everyone there.  I did not want this book to end.  This book had me emotional from the beginning to the end, and even beyond.	5
I fancy myself a &#34;stylish&#34; mom; expensive nursery set, shopping at Restoration Hardware and Pottery Barn Baby. We got the black and grey pack 'n' play that goes well with our home decor, then my parents picked up this pack 'n' play for their home. Our daughter hated the pack 'n' play we had and loved theirs so we ended up getting one too. She loves the colors, and playing with the items on the sides. I love it because it is a square and much larger than the plain one we had. We HIGHLY recommend.	3
It's unfortunate that these are being discontinued (if they haven't been already) because these are AWESOME.  I have long since let mine go, but I regret it everyday.  I recently got some skullcrushers and I think they're okay, for the price, but man.. I really wish I still had these.  I have to say though, some of these prices are kinda outrageous, but they hold up really well, so a gently used one is a very good option.  Good luck, and keep on the beat!	10
This is one of Jillian Harts better books in my opinion. It was a clean well written story that I enjoyed every bit of. The characters were strong and likable. I can not figure out why Ms. Hart feels compelled to write some of her stories filled with sexual description and others without. All of her stories are very interesting, why, then, does she feel she has to throw in the sex stuff that really, in my opinion, adds nothing to the story, in fact ruins it. Case in point, this book.	14
The AI has some serious strategy problems.  In the last game I played, it had all its remaining pieced on 1 and 2, and rolled double ones.  It should have removed 4 from the board, but instead moved 4 from the 2 position, to the 1 position.  Stupid.  Making up for this deficiency, the computer gets better rolls.  It doesn't get more doubles, but it gets higher totals, and usually gets exactly what it needs.  Still fun, but still flawed.	1
This oversized book is full of beautiful photographs.  Each recipe is accompanied by a large color photograph, as well as its region of origin and Italian and English names.  Italian cuisine is explored by region, with spectacular photos and an engaging essay on the cuisine of each of the following regions:  il Nord-Ovest, il Nord-Est, il Centro, il Sud, e le Grandi Isole.  This is a cookbook not only to use in the kitchen, but also to peruse for an enjoyable view of Italian landscapes and a taste of Italian culinary history and regional cuisine.	5
"FUTURE WARS is another reprehensible ""film"" atrocity that's seemingly custom-made for Mike and his bot friends to lampoon mercilessly. The unintelligible plot has something to do w/ wobbly, rubber dinosaurs, silly cyborgs, and a guy who runs around fighting them w/ karate. Robert Z'Dar (MANIAC COP 1-3) makes a painfully humiliating appearance as a bloated, lumbering cyborg! His scenes are almost too much to bear! The rest of this abysmal elephant turd is only watchable through MST3K-vision. Any attempts to view it otherwise could result in a slow, agonizing death..."	0
I think I liked every single page of this book. It was a well-written semi-historical account of circus life and human interaction, but it wasn't over written. Definitely one of the better books I've read. It did move a bit slowly, but it's difficult to notice how slowly a book moves when you read it quickly. I imagine if I had read this book over the stretch of a week or two, it would have been a little less interesting. However, it did motivate me to keep reading, so I doubt I would have wanted to stretch it out that long.	5
I wear these in the yard and when working in the cold and snow and I love them. They really do help keep me warm in the wind.I wear a 38 x 30 or 32 depending on the cut and style of jean. In work boots these are the perfect length for a person who normally wears a 30 length. The same is true of the width, I am usually a perfect 38 and these fit really well.When I need a pair of jeans for wearing after work I will be looking at Wrangler. Very impressed.	8
I felt a bit of a tingle with this mask. Not bad though.  This is exactly the stuff I was looking for.  My mom used to use this when I was little and we would have fun peeling off together.  Great product. Fresh and light and love the softness of my skin afterwards.I like to alternate Freeman's grape seed peel off one night, clay/avacado/oatmeal 2nd night, cucumber peel 3rd....rotation.  Always using a moisturizer and spf and occasion retinol eye cream by ROC.  People tell me all the time that I look 23 and I am 36. Skin needs to be babied.	4
The non-stick bottom and handle to this bowl make mixing so much easier.  On my countertop, and water makes the bowl slip.  But the gripping bottom on this bowl resists slipping, making mixing easier.Unlike some other bowls, this one also has a non-stick handle.  Frankly, my hands get wet more often than my countertop, so the non-stick handle may turn out to be more helpful than the base.The 4 quart size is just about perfect for most simple cake, muffin or biscuit recipes.You will love this bowl.	13
This book is just a fun read. Nothing deep or realistic about the story. Nothing to be learned. No point. Just entertainment. Don't expect to connect with any of the characters because they are totally unrealistic. This book is just pure fantasy, almost childish. I did find the book worth reading, not a waste of time because it is entertaining. However, am I compelled to buy another book from this author? Probably not. Am I going to recommend it to my friends? Probably so with the disclaimer that it is a light fun read.	5
It&#34;s not the movie &#34;inside&#34; the movie that I rave about....it&#34;s these guys, who made Mystery Science Theater a real &#34;hoot&#34;, that I like in all the movies they&#34;ve done. Let&#34;s see....Mike Nelson and his robot friends....Crow, Gypsy, and Tom Servo. These robots remind of The Three Stooges...as robots! It had a great cultic run on TV between 1988-1999 and it looks even better on DVD. With a mighty shout of YES! I recommend it....not because of the movies that Mike and the bots are forced to watch....I like how the guys comment on those awful movies....THEY ARE A RIOT!	0
I am not sure how somebody can screw up a simple audio cable extender cable, but these guys have done it. It is impossible to create a solid connection both inside the iPhone and when connecting the headphone jack. Once everything is snuggly plugged in, the slightest rotation/jerk of the cable in the iphone produces hiss and loss of contact. Same goes for the headphone jack. It's like these things are made not to maintain a continuous contact where they're supposed to have a contact. Avoid at all costs.	7
"This bottle brush has a flexible handle and even fits into bottles with very small spouts (1"" or 1.5"", I'm not sure).  I use this to clean out my bottles weekly and am very happy with this purchase.  I chose to purchase this specific bottle brush because it is so highly-reviewed.  I bought this to replace a former bottle-brush, whose bristles were attached to the stem with wire (so they got bent out of shape).  I really prefer this one, it cleans so well, stays clean, and seems indestructible!"	12
"This is my 3rd pair in about 10+ years. I wear them practically every other day - exercising or working in the yard. These are actually better than the previous ones (from the same manufacturer) that I bought at a brick and mortar.  Those had a very annoying ""mute"" button on the cord. These do not. Compared to other ear plugs (or in the ear headphones) that I have, I can use these when I run or bike (in the summer) without them falling out. I've paid over $30 for others that didn't work half as well."	10
I have an average sized mattress and this fits perfectly!  It is super easy to install!  If it &quot;bunches up&quot; like some others suggest, it is because it isn't put on the mattress correctly.  A little tug, and it goes right in place... kind of like a normal bed sheet, know what I mean?After washing, many lint balls pile up, but it is durable in the fact that it isn't falling apart!  Just because it collects lint balls doesn't make it any less durable in my honest opinion.I recommend at least two of these!	3
This was a really terrific film.  I wish they could've made a series of films like this to capture the entire festival, but this comes as close as we've got I guess.  As it was, I felt transported and when it was over, I was sad to leave it.  Really glad I got the director's cut!  This is a great historical document that captures not only the music (though I wish there were more), but the climate (political and natural) surrounding the festival as well.  Whether you were there or wish you could have been, this is a great trip!	6
I drink a lot of tea, and have become a huge fan of Yogi teas.  In fact, I've never been let down by Yogi tea.  The individual packaging is high quality, and the tea bags are kept very fresh.This Kombucha tea is tasty and has a wonderful aroma.  I'm not sure what kind of kombucha is in it though, because a big part of kombucha are the probiotics and obviously those would be absent from a packaged dry tea.  That being said, I love this tea and have recommended to friends.Flavor is a clean mint with plum.	11
I have a 15 year old model that uses sticky discs instead of hook&loop and no vac attachment. I have many hours on this sander and it has fallen off the work bench to the concrete floor and the ground many times...nothing has ever broke; This sander takes a licking and keeps on ticking. I had to replace the pad once. It has been extremely reliable and does a great job of swirl free sanding. It really slings out the dust,so a vac-setup on it would be great,which the new models come with. I highly recommend this sander!	21
I was very excited about this purchase until I tried this truffle.These were horrible.  Maybe I got the worst bottle they have ever sold and I just happened to get them.  But, these are bad.  If you want to eat the root of a dirty old root of a tree, you will enjoy these.  If you doubt my credibility of my review, please feel free to read my other reviews.  Please don't waste your money.  My wife tried these and couldn't even believe these could be called truffles.	11
Well, went on the internet first....$14.00, then to a very well known store, here in Gloucester, MA, $28.  I was not happy.  Then, of course, I knew Amazon would come up with something...they did, $4.00 and change...it arrived promptly.  I cannot say enough about Amazon, they are realistic in their prices, knowing that people do not have that kind of money to pay for a wire,,for 14 or 28 dollars. I have never been so happy to get what I need without spending my last dollar for it.  Thank you again and again.	7
Simply the best protectant I've ever tried. No greasy feeling like armor all, no tacky feeling like Meguiar's. The scent is a pleasant &#34;fresh&#34; smell. Does a fairly good job of taking off scuffs and such. It doesn't seem to attract dust, so flat trim looks better longer.A little goes a long way. I find I use about a quarter as much of this as I do the other protectants when doing my interior. Given this, while it isn't cheap, it really ends up costing less over the long term.	2
We've been using these bottles since our son was 1 week old, and they work great. He had no problem with nipple confusion switching between this bottle and the breast. We've had no problems with leaking, and I love the fact that you can convert the bottles to sippy cups later.One note for breastfeeding moms -- your baby may be able to use the #1 nipple for much longer than a formula-fed baby, since it more closely resembles how the milk comes from you. So wait before buying #2 & #3 nipples, because you may not need them!	3
"This fan really moves the air. To give you an idea how good this fan works, do you know those 20"" box fans they sell for 15 or 20 bucks, well this Lasko 3300 fan on low blows as hard as the 20"" box fan on high. No kidding. I think this is by far the best fan I've ever owned.Will post a couple pictures for you to get a better look at it. I would recommend this to anyone in need of a fan. Don't hesitate, buy it."	13
Two stars were deducted because one of the pegs fell out which required a re-gluing.  Otherwise, this product, like all other Plan Toys' products, uses replenishable rubber tree wood and vegetable dyes for coloring, and is smooth and well-machined -- good for the little one who sticks everything in her mouth.  On the same token, the loose peg was small enough to pose a serious choking hazard and I always make a habit of regularly inspecting this toy -- something I should do with all toys anyway.	22
I bought this to test out the product, much better than the crap tetra brand I'd used before.  1 ml per gallon of water for de-chlorinating so getting a litter bottle to last a while, don't have to shake before use, and at least for me, doesn't smell bad.  I use a small needless syringe with ml/cc marked to easily dose.  Can be used to de-tox ammonia or nitrite but takes a larger dosage per gallon.Will be buying the 2 liter size to last me a longer bit.	19
I had no problem with my red DVD/CD player. I pluged it in and worked immediately in my three laptops.  I have a ten year old HP laptop that I don't use much, but I pluged the external USB in it just to see if it would work on an old one, and it worked fine. I bought this DVD/CD player to use with a netbook that I bought, but it has not arrived yet, so I can not tell if it will work in the netbook. If I have any problems with it I will update this review later on.	10
I really like this Flower Pot Holder.  It fits great on the railing that leads down my back steps.  It was quick and easy to set-up and it's a really nice quality.  It holds my flower pots really well.  It's nice, simple & basic.Having just one of these seems odd.  I would definitely recommend getting yourself a set.  I think they would look better if you had 2 spaced out just a little bit from each other.I like this Flower Pot Holder and I would recommend it.	18
Purchased this tool to perform the job of stapling a pre-finished oak floor and all I can say it worked just GREAT. I had one mis-fire but that was totally my fault. With the right pressure from you compressor it will work wonders for you as well. If you are going to us this tool on pre finished flooring make sure you purchase the kit that will keep you floor from being damaged or marring. I purchased it and worked perfectly ...not one scratch. The floor came out beautiful.........	21
I purchased this for my 4 year old son and he doesn't really like it. He used the attaching pieces to make things like he would with blocks; the gears just lay on the floor. I personally think it is a great toy to teach kids mechanical concepts. I did myself have trouble figuring out how to place attaching pieces in multiple formats, so it is a good idea to guide your child with this toy so that they can see how creative they can get with this. Maybe my son will get into it later, I think it's worth hanging on to.	22
I got this for a co-worker friend of mine for his birthday, who had heard a few of us baby boomers talking about the 70s disco era/our dancing during it.  I LOVED this movie when it came out, and knew that he would love seeing the big hairdos of the Commadores.  He watched it one weekend, loved it, and got his wife up to dance.  Anyone wanting to know about the dress, the clubs, music and having a good time, get this!!!	15
"OMG,  I had this CD too, used and tossed but bought it again for ""Next To You.""  I love the song and it's one of the better ballads on here. I should have kept this CD but it was scratched it's better than ""Spellbound,"" now thats a CD I should have tossed.Anyway,  Paula is no Janet,  but she had some memorable hits on this CD such as ""Straight Up"" and ""Opposites Attract"". Oh, also forgot ""Cold Hearted Snake."""	9
"I'm following the Vaso Guard therapy from ""What your doctor won't tell you About Hypertension"". The author has a list of vitamins,etc to take and lists specific forms of the vitamins.The author (also a doctor) was very specific in the E coming from several types. This was the only brand I could find that actually included the information!!!It's very frustrating that many brands don't include that info in either a picture of the back of the bottle, so you can see that, or at least in the description field.I'm glad this one did!"	12
Water for Elephants is a love story set in a post depression traveling circus and told from the memory of 93 year-old man.  The story jumps between the current life of the narrator a uncontented man who believes he is 90 or 93 and his rememberance of the love story between Jacob and the Benzini Brother's circus.After the death of both his parents Jacob a veterinairian student finds himself penniless. Although not intentionally  he runs away to the circus where he finds love.This story give great historical flavor and is a must read.	5
It does it's job.  It does warm bottles quickly and the variable temperature is a great feature, but I, as well as everyone else I know who own one, have overflowed this model repeatedly.  Who needs another thing to clean up when you have a little one around?  There are warmers that have specific compartments for warming jars of baby food, this one doesn't work well for jars, but then again, my son doesn't really like his food warmed up.  It's an O.K. model to have.	3
My diabetic brother STRONGLY recommended this to me.  I am not diabetic, but I watch my carbs. I had tried other sugar-free syrups, and they all disappointed me, and I had given up on carb-free syrup (and, thus, on all syrup, because I won't eat that sugary stuff).  But, on the urging of my brother, I decided to try once more.This syrup is AMAZING.  It tastes exactly like the sugary stuff the kids eat.  The consistency is a little bit thinner, but the taste is exactly the same.  Even my kids can't tell the difference.	11
Great product.  I used to work at Red Lobster and peeled and deveined LOTS of shrimp and this style is the best I&#8217;ve used.  After using a lot of other deveiners, this is the only one I found that cuts through the shell, cleans out the vein, works quickly and doesn&#8217;t create any waste.  I had one of these for years and somehow lost it.  I had to look hard to find this style of peeler/deveiner but wouldn&#8217;t settle for any other kind.  Highly recommend.	13
This is my favorite bra, I have had many of these in several different colors over the years.  I'm not sure if they have discontinuing this bra or not but it's getting harder to find.  I love the size range they offer.  I used to wear a 34 G in this bra but after gaining a little weight I am now a 36 FF.  Simple, sexy, supportive, and it gives me a magnificent decolletage, something a large breasted woman has trouble finding at times!	8
We are fortunate in the design of our computer desk.  A baby safety gate did the trick for us. Instead of installing a power strip safety cover, I purchased an inexpensive tension safety gate (ten bucks) and pushed it way back under the desk against the wall with all the cords and boxes (routers etc.) behind it.  Keeps his little hands out of everything and I still have room for my chair & feet.  Still trying to find the best solution for protection for 2 other strips in our home. Seems like nothing is perfect.	3
We got this for our 7 month old twins who have just started sitting up alone but are still a bit wobbly.  The tub is really cute but the bottom panel on the one we got had a leak and would not stay inflated, which completely defeats the purpose of creating a soft surface for them.  We ended up putting the infant bath sponge that we used when they were newborns in the bottom and sitting them on that.  They had a great time splashing and playing.  It's a great tub if you get one that holds air.	3
Best &#34;what if&#34; series I've seen since  the &#34;Amerika&#34; mini series years ago.Very good acting.  Very convincing.Hollywood used the &#34;nuclear blasts&#34; scenario, but I honestly don't believe that scenario will be the catalyst to bring this country (actually this planet) to it's knees.  I believe it's going to be some major cosmic event that's going to change this planet and the life of every living thing on it.  No one knows exactly what's going to happen, but it more than likely will be life changing.	0
This ABC VIDEO tape of Woody Allen's TAKE THE MONEY AND RUN (1969) seems suspect. Although the back cover says it's a licensed product, I can't imagine why FOX would allow a company to sell really BAD copies of any of their catalogue.Further, ABC VIDEO is not affiliated with PARAMOUNT.The tape tracks well and has good HiFi audio, but it's all downhill from there. Recorded at the slowest speed, it's got a blurry picture that over-saturates with color. Had I known ABC VIDEO meant: crapola, I wouldn't have bought this doorstop, and humbly suggest that you don't either. Go with the1992 FOX HOME ENTERTAINMENTversion instead.	15
I went and bought this cd and I was not dissapointed with it at all. I heard very good things about it and I rushed out to get it as soon as I could. In my opinion, it is one of the greatest MISFITS cd's ever made! Every song on it is no less than perfect, such as,&quot;Earth A.D.&quot;, &quot;Die die my darling&quot;, &quot;We bite&quot;, &quot;Wolfs blood&quot;, &quot;Blood feast&quot; and many more! If your a real die hard MISFITS fan like me than go out and get this cd. It is a classic in my book!!	9
"I am somewhat of a windshield wiper snob.  I LOVE these. I've had many other brands of a similar style that has the internal metal structure only, including OEM Nissan wipers that are similar in style.This is the only brand that has two simultaneous capabilities:1.  Doesn't skid/make noise when there isn't enough water.2.  Uniformly wipes the window and doesn't seem to get ""spots"" where it doesn't wipeI am not a Rain X user, but I do use the Rain X wiper fluid.  I find the combination of that and these blades work very well together."	2
I've read the book (10 times) and seen all the movie versions.  The &quot;Jane&quot; in this video was unbelievably haughty and unattractive.  How in the world did Rochester ever fall in love with her?  When they kiss in the movie there is the &quot;chemistry&quot; (mentioned in other reviews), but lust isn't what the book is all about.  All my favorite passages were cut out or adulterated beyond recognition.  This would be a terrific disappointment to any one who really loves the book.	15
I've been using Norton Brand for years just because it is readily available locally.  When it came time to stock up, Mirka was recommended, so I decided to give it a try, especially since a 50-pack costs $17, vs.  $9 on a 10-pack of equivalent Norton Sandpaper.After using the Mirka for a few weeks, there is no comparison.  The Mirka last longer and the 320 grit leaves a smoother finish than any other 320 grit paper I've used.  As I use up my Norton paper, I will be replacing it exclusively with Mirka H&L; disks.	21
Building The Perfect Beast was at the peak of music technology for 1984 and still sounds excellent today. Sunset Grill and Boys of Summer will live on as 80's all time rock classics. Don's lite rock is just as good as his  hard rock songs. Don always has great studio musicians backing him and has  an  all star lineup here. Danny Korchmar's guitar playing rocks throughout  the CD. David Paich and Michael Boddiker do excellent work on the  synthesizers; especially on Sunset Grill. Every song is good, if not great  on this album, plus Henley's lyrics always make his recordings worth a  listen.	9
Mail order bride, Clarissa, is running from her past and seeking a fresh start in the west. Logan and Derek, long-time friends and business partners, are seeking to share a mail order bride wife. I loved this plot and all three main characters were almost immediately endearing. Both men clearly cared about Clarissa and deeply wanted to give her a good life with the both of them. There were a few parts where the dialogue was a little cheesy and I noticed a few spelling/editing errors, but not too bad. I look forward to reading the rest of this series.	14
This is the best pair of jeans I've owned in a very many years, and in every respect. The cut is ideal and handles my not-quite-slim gut while giving my leg a slim look. The denim is a real heavy weight that feels great on the legs. The pockets look good and are well sized. The jeans cold wash well. I hang them dry and they take quite a while. They've really made me feel more confident about how I look. Nice surprise given I never heard of the brand before.	8
I bought these primarily because they are so cheap. The quality is good I would say - not great, but not terrible either. They sound great for a few weeks but then become very dull. They don't last nearly as long as Elixirs, but then again, they are a lot cheaper than Elixirs. I would recommend these for practice - no gigging with these as the sound isn't quite as crisp as I would think a performer would want. For the price though, it's hard to knock on them too much.	16
Great set, but you'll need more nipples. At least 2 out of the 5 are Fast Flow, which I didn't use until my baby was 8-9 months old. The nipples are like $4 for a 2pk, so add that to the cost when comparison shopping.Other than that, I love these bottles! I don't have a single complaint about them. I do not use a bottle warmer. They do leak in the diaper bag when not kept upright, but I store mine upright, so that's a non-issue.	3
This app contains 3 word games. However, as others have mentioned, there don't seem to be levels. Each game is scored, but high scores aren't saved anywhere. Also, unlike other word games, exiting the app ends the current game, rather than pausing it for later. That is my biggest concern. I like to go in and out of games over the course of days.As it is, it's ok for free. I wouldn't pay full price until they updated this app with some basic features.	1
We used this bath tub with our first son and loved it. It truly  last a lot longer than most and is very safe with infants.However, i just re-ordered one for our second son and had to return it because we now live in a smaller space and it is way too big! If you live in a small place, consider that because it is very large and difficult to store.On a side note, the packaging was beyond awful. the box was damaged, not closed...bad bad bad	3
Thanks to repeated government indoctrination and Hollywood &#34;political correctness&#34;, everybody knows the Nazis were bad guys who murdered Jews.But, there's much more to that story - - -This movie, &#34;THE SOVIET STORY&#34;, reveals how Hitler and the Nazis learned their extermination methods by copying Stalin and the Soviets, with whom they were formally allied for many years, and even after the war, the Soviets continued to use the Nazi concentration camps.Everyone needs to see this movie.I've bought extra copies to as gifts for friends and family.	15
This is 2nd one bought to be used as a backup filter for my 60 gallon tank, so I do recommend buying one. It works well to complement my Rena xP3. Very quiet as in the motor, gives the water flow sound, which is good for some people, myself included. Because my tank have live plants, sand substrate and cichlids, the filter does get clogged a lot.  Have to clean it biweekly. Love buying it via Amazon, fast delivery and cheaper than everyone else on this particular item!	19
I looked everywhere for a tub without all the grooves for baby's body - I wanted something that would submerge nicely from the neck down and this looked like it would do the trick. Unfortunately, it doesn't hold any water to submerge anything than perhaps the feet. Leaks horribly, bulky - we gave up, returned it, and now we just bath with baby. Nothing works better than you own hands on your slippery baby anyway, and you can avoid sore knees from bathroom tile and stiff back from bending over the tub.	3
I own this DVD player.  I just bought it in late March 2000.  It is the first DVD player I've ever owned.  The sound and picture are great with my dad's home theater.  I am seriously thinking about getting one for my bedroom.  I just bought a 32-inch Toshiba tv for my bedroom.For those of you who have problems getting rid of the ZOOM in the lower right hand corner, hit the setup button TWICE, that should get rid of the ZOOM.Enjoy!Update 10/9/07I still have this DVD player and it works great!	10
I laughed an awful lot reading this book. I loved it! But, then again, I'm a sucker for stories involving a Toppy Top and a Mouthy Bottom.Laine is absolutely adorable. He is the biggest klutz with the worst coordination and driving record on the planet. He says exactly what pops into his head. Devlin is an Alpha looking to relocate his pack. Dev is dominant, sexy, strong, smart and has a great sense of humor. Good thing too since his best friends wife and Laine are both catalysts for disaster.This is a wonderful short read that I truly wish was longer.	14
It has a comfortable seat and seems stable and well-made.  However, if you need to haul it around frequently, it takes a bit of time to set up and screw down or open up the screws that hold the moving stability bar on the bottom of the seat. Also, if you need to adjust the height, you have to remove the entire bolt assembly seen at the crossing point of the bars, and then select one of three holes that are only an inch or some apart from each other.  So, not much selection there.	16
I have had no problems using these and they work as described.  I do not like, though, that you have to hammer in the retaining tab to prevent the platform arms from coming out.  I also do not see how these are really double locking.  I wish they came with a adapter for the saddle since the saddle area is pretty big, but I knew that these weren't completely flat saddles (I made an adapter).  I would recommend them, but know what you are getting before you pull the trigger on getting them.	2
I'm a little disappointed in Hi-Lift Jack. Top is 2 piece and welded in the middle. Should have been one piece. They supplied a bolt rather than some sort of quick release pin to attach it. A bolt with a hand tightened nut will vibrate loose during transport. The hook on the bottom could have been a little deeper to grab onto other items other than round bumpers more securely. All in all a good add-on for your Hi-lift jack but it could have been designed a little better.	2
Strong and well made. I recommend this product, and Prime for shipping 2-day. Very handy to have one of these, good truck fit and connection, nice there are two positions for mounting it. Though it states Made in China it seems well made. Expect the paint to come off with use, lube the hook well. The only problem I foresee is grease on the pants if you choose to leave it on, as you can't put a cover over it. Leaving it on the farthest-in position may help.	2
We purchased this mouse catcher last year when we were suddenly inundated with winter lodgers in the basement.  At first, this trap did a fine job, but then it just petered out on us and stopped working.With items like this it is hard to say where the fault lies, so we are giving it Three Stars.  We had better luck though with the Woodstream Havahart Mouse Trap.Three Stars.  Leaves mice sweaty but ready to live outside again.  For us the trap stopped trapping after a couple of months.	18
I already liked the cheeky hero from reading about him in the first book, An Inconvenient Duchess. Always love a bad boy! What makes this story so funny to me is him trying his best to stay out of the heroine's clutches (well, not really clutches) and maintaining his honor.  It is quite the turn around from a rakish hellion!  I started and finished the story in one day - it is a quick - but satisfying - read.  It flows smoothly and has just enough tension.  It isn't deep but it is good and I'm heading out to find more of her stories!	14
"I read this book only because it was on my book club list. I had passed it up many times in my search for a ""good"" book to read. When it came time to read it for the book club I was not looking forward to it. All I can say now is WOW!!! I would have missed a great ride had I not been ""forced"" to read this WONDERFUL story. By the end I was cheering! I have since recomended it to many people and they all have had the same reaction. This is a keeper!"	5
Getting grain free treats for training usually leaves three options: hard biscuits (and who wants to work for those?), cooked meat (which is gross to handle), or commercial meaty grain-free treats which cost an arm and a leg.These on the other hand, are very affordable, not gross to handle, and the dogs think they smell AMAZING.  They work great when your dog's attention is wavering - a waff of freeze dried beef liver usually snaps them back to attention!Also, being as they're only beef liver, I don't feel bad feeding my dog as many as needed for training.Highly recommended.	19
I enjoyed the game very much. There is not a help/spoiler file, but it's really not needed. The one place I got stuck - throw the pretty box in the fire! The graphics are beautiful, the play is smooth. The sound is not as good as the sound on The Lost City, but not bad. Really, this would get 5 stars if only it was longer. I'd prefer something like Myst; something to take days/weeks to complete, rather than a couple of hours.	1
That makes this my first Costco purchase.  I have a one person household so a mountain of toilet paper isn't that attractive.  I'll say though, it was a bit of a shock to see Costco using Amazon.  They seem to have an active site of their own.As to the paper, it is a nice bright white that I don't have to be embarrassed using.  It is the right weight to go through my laser.  So, 3 to 5 stars are certainly in order.  I went with the middle but could have gone higher, if &#34;Loving&#34; paper had a bit better connotation.	17
This thing can keep a beer cold in the heat for hours. Seriously. It's that good. it's expensive, but if you like cold beer, invest in one. Especially if you're the type of person who doesn't finish the bottom of the beer can when it gets warm from taking too long to drink. This will solve that problem. I also noticed that since my beer stays cold so much longer, I don't find myself drinking as much. This keeps me from getting too..... well you know.	20
I played this game as a child so when I saw it I thought my 3-year-old son would love it.  He does!  We play it as a family and each time we just have so much fun together.  He totally gets putting the beans on the top of the kettle, he's taking turns (so important) and he gets that it's one bean (not 3 or 4) at a time.  Such a great way to teach your child manners and counting and have fun doing it.	22
The first of the Wicked Warrens was a blast!!Two people who have desired each other from afar for months are finally given an opportunity to meet face to face under the most outrageous of circumstances!!Just when you think a little voyeurism can&#8217;t hurt anybody, you get caught ogling your friend&#8217;s HOT, naked neighbour, by none other than said HOT guy!!!Things get hot and heavy from there and our couple are forced to question whether their physical chemistry is all they have going for them.Cute one-liners, loads of passion and angst, keep this story going till the end, so I'm looking forward to book two!	14
I'm a Coke guy, not a Pepsi guy.  Coke has the right amount of carbonation and is not too sweet.  It's is a very refreshing cola product.  In my opinion, you just can't beat plain old Coke.This 12-pack of 12 is very convenient.  If you are going to party it's easy to carry and it fits nicely in the refrigerator.  This is a flap that you tear opens that dispenses one can at a time so you don't have to fill up your refrigerator with upright soda cans.	11
It smells great and the product can be seen in many barber shops. I've been using it for my customers after all straight razor shaves, but I think I'm going to switch it up for the my next after shave purchase. I suspect this product has a high level of alcohol which is great for killing bacteria, but the sting irritates some of the customers. Some of the other barbers I work with have been using other high end products which does a better job at soothing freshly shaved skin without the sting.	12
I have tried the 5% and the 10% version of this bar and I would say that it is pretty effective to a degree.  The most I can use this bar is once a day every other day in the colder months and once a day every day in warmer months.  I would describe my skin as sensitive but it is not extremely sensitive like some folks I know.  I have to make sure that I rinse very well so it doesn't bleach my sheets or clothes and follow up with a good moisturizer, depending on the weather.	4
This is a very inexpensive sprinkler head. The Rain Bird works well in the short radius range. It gets everything covered out about 24 feet with reasonable even water coverage. If it is adjusted to a larger radius, it tends to put most of the water out near the outer perimeter and close to the sprinkler. Not very much water falls in the middle area. Since I wasn't really looking to pay much and don't need a very wide coverage it works for me. If you need a large area covered evenly, I suggest a better sprinkler.	18
I was so looking forward to this book. Then it came and there is a double space between each and every paragraph. (on the Kindle edition)  Since the action moves around, the formatting makes the story hard to follow, and only the die hard (like me) will want to bother.It's a sad thing when a good book is so spoiled by formatting. But it is not the fault of the author or the story. This is a good book for any who have the energy to read it.I've also emailed the author.	14
I use this as tippet material when fly fishing for bass and bream.  It's strong, doesn't stretch a lot, and so far has proven to be pretty resistent to abraison from rubbing on rocks or limbs.  It's tough to break, even when I'm trying.  Bass and bluegill are not really line-shy, but on clear days in clear water, I like to be as covert as possible with my presentations, so this line works great for that.  I also use Berkley XT in 6lb., in the green color for stained water.	20
When your playing this it  feels just like your in a real las vegas casino. With the buy ins for all the different tournament. Even the whole way the screen is set up makes it feel so real. This is the best one ive found so far only downside is it doesnt give u much to play with if you dont buy. So you have to bet extremely low and cant play awhile. Still its fun and i recommend anyone looking for a real blackjack app to dowload this one.	1
I love this diaper pail. Yea, if you let poopy diapers sit in it for too long and don't change the bag on a regular basis it will start to stink but  c'mon its a bucket full of poopy diapers.As you child grows, or if you have older children watch out. The handle system fascinates  little ones and they find it amusing that they can put something in, flip it and it disappears,  which is good when it's a diaper, bad when it's,,, your keys.	3
I made a cut into a maple crown molding and the only thing I can say is WOW. I have gotten used to the saw blade at the local home store that has some tear-out on the back side. This is the best saw blade I have used to date. This cut is so clean it feels like glass and no tear-out not even a mark on the bottom of the cut. If you are pondering about spending the money on a blade like this. DO IT, you will not regret it. I will not waste money on other blades at other stores.	21
Decent for price, better than the other one I got(Blackhawk a little pricey). Does exactly what it is intended to do, hold shotgun shells and help keep your pants up. Stitching seems to be good quality, elastic nice and tight to hold shells so they won't fall out even after some wear(sorta difficult to put shells in first few times, but definitely a trade off I don't mind. Better than wearing out and shells falling out). I like my Blackhawk, but for the price difference, I love this one.	20
I have tried many brands of Chinese style BBQ seasoning...from dry packets to bottle sauces...and this one is THE BEST! It looks, smells and tastes like the kind of red and sweet BBQ pork you get in most Chinese restaurants. I have bought and re-ordered these packets from Amazon when my grocery stores quit carrying this brand. They are not as sweet as what you get in a restaurant...so I add a tiny bit of brown sugar to mine when I marinate...also works well with chicken. YUMMY =)	11
This may be the world's worst product. It is hard to work with, even when following the directions carefully. Once in place, it squishes out of your dentures all over the outside. No matter how much you clean it off, moer of it squishes right back out again. In addition, even after letting it set for thirty minutes or more, when the denture is removed, the cushion grip plastic like substance stays in your mouth; not in the denture. No doubt, this manufacture was trying to make a product to help people but it does not work.	12
I had a pair of Sennheiser headphones that had about a 100 dollar price tag that broke.  These were around 30 dollars and are comparable set of headphones if your looking to save a little money.  Granted I think the Sennheiser were a little better, but you cannot beat these at this price point.  They defiantly pickup on the lower range bass sounds quite well.  Where I think these headphones slightly lack is the midrange, and some fine detail that you get on a nice set of headphones, but that's expected at this price.	10
The bottle quality isn't great for the price.  Dr. Brown's bottles (the narrow ones) screw right into the Pump In Style.  So you can pump and use, just as you would with these bottles. If you use regular bottles, the Evenflo set is 1/3 of the price and fits right in. Or you can buy Evenflo bottles without the nipples for $4.99 to pour into other brands of bottles.  I use Dr. Brown's - since those are pricey, when I use up all of those, I just use the Evenflo to store extra milk and pour it into the Dr. Brown's bottles.	3
These are the only bottles I use and they work well.  They are very durable & dishwasher safe. I have a medela pump also. My daughter is breastfed and feeds from these well, except for with the slow flow nipples - I recommend a fast flow nipple unless you want to take over a half hour to feed your baby while he/she struggles to get the milk out.  I should mention that she is not picky (becasue some babies are)about what type/brand of nipple she uses as long as the flow is not too slow.	3
For several years I used a Logitech Bluetooth for my cell phone, and while it worked great, it was always uncomfortable. When it snapped in two, I decided on the Voyager 510! Wow, not only does it work great, but it is VERY, VERY COMFORTABLE! In fact, I can honestly say I actually forget that I am wearing it, something I cannot say about my previous device. So for all of you thinking of a headset, you cannot go wrong with this one! Five stars!	7
I got this in hopes it would stop the rabbits in my yard.  I applied it as directed in paths of the critters.  I did not notice ANY improvement, nor did my cocker spaniel seem to stop at it's locations.  I wish I could report it works well, but not for me id doesn't.  My imagination says it kept them at bay for maybe a day, but a no rain day later, things were back to the way they were.  I think it was my imagination.  I have not had luck with any product.  Nothing more to say about this - it failed me.	18
"This was a great story. I loved each of the 3 chapters.I wish it had been an entire book, so that I could get more background on the 'whys' of the 2 main characters.I have to wonder what the 'One Star' reviewers expected. I mean the name implies it is about Serial Killers. The blurb was right on target.Of course it's gruesome & disturbing & sick.Geez, have those reviewers reviewed Peter Pan and given it 1 star because ""it's a kid's book"".It's pretty ridiculous to rate a book low because it fits its genre."	14
It started out really good, with the military killing zombies, and one being bitten and accidentally goes to the strip club. There are some smokin' hot naked girls stripping and most of them get bitten and turn into 'Zombie Strippers' They like it because it inhances their performance. Soon, they must stop the flesh-eating strippers or everyone will die! I didn't like the idea of the zombie strippers talking, I like the quiet zombies. If you love zombies and naked women, you'll love ZOMBIE STRIPPERS!!!	0
This contains the same ingredients as dog repellant, and it works on a large variety of animals, not just deer, rabbits, and squirrels.  This white milky liquid contains rotten eggs, hot pepper, and garlic.  It doesn't smell much to humans when you apply it, so I was able to use it around the garden close to the house without any noticeable after effects.  I never liked battery operated disposable sprayers, though.  It works fine, but I could have sprayed it faster with more power if it was manually operated.	18
Results of this product vary depending on how severe your condition is.  If you are really constipated, prepared to be in pain with cramping.  I took this product when I was experiencing bloating and the full feeling and the next morning I was miserable.  I kept feeling like I was going to faint and I had moderate pain and cramping in my gut.  It relieved the constipation, but at what price?  Other times, I have taken it and only experienced runny stools, but anytime you take it, it does cause cramping.  I prefer milk of magnesia instead.	12
"I loved this book from beginning to end. Along with some entertaining history, this is a beautifully woven tale.  To my mind, a good novel has unexpected twists and surprises .. and this book carried one beautiful surprise all the way through.This book stirred in me an affection for elephants that I hadn't felt since childhood.  Along with The Magician's Elephant by Kate DiCamillo, Water for Elephants helped to inspire the painting ""The Gentle Somnambulist"" which is included in my bookTREASURE Twenty One Paintings and a Key."	5
"I have used other business card forms for printing custom made business cards. The results were acceptable, but you could tell that the cards were part of a larger sheet from the rough edges.Avery has raised the bar for print it yourself business cards. They provide templates on their web site [...] and now offer these Clean Edge Business Card forms (28878). As the name implies, the cards snap apart cleanly after printing so you get more professional results.In today's job market you need an ""edge"" over the competition to ""separate"" you from the crowd. These cards can help."	17
1938, Black & White-This is a charming film about a family of con artist whose lives are changed by a little old lady. I love Janet Gaynor, and she puts in a wonderful performance as usual. This is a pretty boy part for the the talented Douglas Fairbanks Jr. The part doesn't really show off his talent, but he is easy on the eyes. Richard Carlson plays a Scottish suitor for Gaynor- not really believable. The somewhat slow beginning is transformed by the appearance of Minnie Dupree as Ellen Fortune.	15
Some years ago I stopped buying any sandpaper that wasn't Norton 3X. It lasted 4-5 times longer that any other I had. I only used a finish sander and sanding blocks. When I purchased a random orbital sander and went looking for paper these looked like they were worth a try. They last so long that I probably have a lifetime supply (I also bought all the other grits available). Most of my sanding is on raw wood. When sanding finished/stained wood...well I haven't yet found a paper that doesn't clog. Still use the Norton for all finish/block sanding jobs.	21
works great for my needs, but I'm not a fan of the coiled wire and angled plug. thankfully the coil is a softer compound so it doesn't pull on my head during use, but I would have preferred a straight wire. I know I know-- &#34;it was in the details&#34;. Well, I admit I apparently didn't read them all.the angled plug is more an issue, since a straight plug fits my needs better.I shopped Koss based on another Koss headset I bought. I'd buy Koss again (obviously).	10
I remember seeing these in K-Mart way back in college. Hard to imagine that they're still making them, or that they're really still that good! Perhaps the latter is the reason for the former. You can spend a couple hours online reading one review after another after  google-ing &#34;best bang for the buck headphones under $100.&#34; Yeh, I did that. Or you can just take 8 seconds and click &#34;add to cart&#34; and get them delivered to your door in a day or so. Really, you're not going to be sorry. Really. No, really.	10
I have used this sander in many ways it was not intended. Abuse after abuse it keeps running. I would have given it four stars because the dust bag is somewhat cheap and does not attach properly but then I dropped it 2 stories on to a paved driveway. Not even a dent. Up to five stars. I have used it non stop for hours. I should have bought more sander for the tasks but it was there and I needed a sander. When I do finally get a random orbital sander I will get another DeWalt.	21
I love these headphones in behind the head mode (especially now that I know the earpieces can rotate). In over-the-head mode I find the band a little tight. It works, but the earphones barely cover my ears. I have a large head, and doubt most people will have any discomfort using this in over-the-head mode. But I'll likely be using it in behind the head mode even when I'm not outside wearing a hat, just because it's more comfortable.	10
I have four different gates in my house, and this, by far, is the most secure and stable. Therefore, it's at the top of my stairs... the most important place. I feel like I could even sit on that gate, and it's no going to budge.When we have guests over, they have trouble opening it, because you have to squeeze really hard, but I like that I have to squeeze really hard... it keeps my child who is now a clever 3.5 year old from being able to open it do this day.	3
I like this container.  It's easy to set an entire bag of dog food inside.  It rolls into my pantry and easily rolls out when needed.  I wish it was sturdier but as long as I don't drop the bag in (set it down easily instead) it should hold up.  Air tight?  Maybe but the plastic has a lot of flex so no, it's not air tight when you move it around or do anything with it.  I do think it seals well enough to keep bug out and the smell contained when it is left alone.	19
I've been using this to keep plants alive during the frost, I didn't think they could grow anymore because of the cold. This thing makes them grow! I was surprised. The plants went from about 12 inches tall to about 18 inches. I keep the light on for about 16 hours a day, and if it's warm enough outside I put them out there on a roller.My only con is that the frame could be built better, other than that it's great if you have a few plants you need to keep alive during the winter. It's good even if you want to start plants.	18
Zillow just seems to be lacking in a lot of listings that I have seen for the &#34;homes near me&#34; from other apps that I have used. It's almost strange that I can turn on a different app and find 10 houses near me for sale in my price range, but with Zillow I can't even find 10 houses for sale near me in any price range. I still use it when I'm searching, in hopes that something will pop up. Usually, it doesnt. It is detailed when I finally find a listing though!	1
I understand some of the criticism, but does a book have to be a literary masterpiece to be immensely enjoyable?  The overwhelming positive reviews explain why not.It is well researched, but maybe the plot stretched a bit too far at times and low quality dialogues have taken away from the book's otherwise star quality.The depression era was well represented, gave a good realistic feel of the troubled times and the people.  Circus setting was pure genius, and made it so interesting.Overall, it is a very enjoyable book, very readable.	5
I have used Mobil 1 on all my vehicle's for years and after buying a new to me, HD 2010 ultra Limited was pleased to see the they also made the V-twin moil 1 for it. I call them to ask what makes this a better product than the OEM oil that HD sell's and they explained that it is specially formulated to meet or exceed the requirement need with air cooled HD engineers as well as trans and primary case requirements. I believe that they manufacture a superior product and will be only running it on my bike.	2
As I said, Silent Blade and Silver Shark are really quick reads, so I don't want to give too much away. So let me just say this, if you're looking for a new world to explore with a lot of hidden possibilities and characters that are not only intriguing in what they can do, but who they are, then you definitely want to pick up from Silent Blade and Silver Shark Ilona Andrews. Considering Silent Blade is only $2.5o and Silver Shark is $2.99, there's really no reason not to get them.  They are worth every penny.For my full review, check out Literary Escapism.com.	14
I love MyFitnessPal.  Even though I'm not trying to lose a lot of weight quickly, it really does make you accountable for what you are actually eating.  I like that it isn't only about calories, but carbs, fats, etc.  I really like all the info in it's database and also exercise figured into the whole plan.  I'm not hungry, have been enjoying treats as well and have lost 3 pounds in two weeks.  I'm really mostly interested in just being healthy.	1
I finally sold it. It does work but the batteries go very quick. Ne problem with this is since it provides a circular perimeter, we had to put a very small range as keeping a wider range made it not to work where our neighbors houses were. Looks like the circle ends up somewhere in their house and our dogs figured that out and would take off in that direction. Going for an in-ground wired fence as i can control the area i want. Good for large houses maybe with tons of room between the neighboring houses.	19
I had always wanted to read the Apocrypha and was glad to find it on my Kindle.  Being a Christian, I have read the Bible through several times, but was always curious about these &#34;missing&#34; books.  After reading this it is easy to see why these books were not included in the scriptural canon.  However, they do provide some historical information about ancient religion.  I especially appreciated the background information given before each book.  I personally would recommend that anyone who reads this would read the entire Bible first.  It will make more sense to you then.	14
Yup, it goes in my trunk, or in my truck. It is that important. And, the Milwaukee Offset head fits in the carry case with the extra battery and charger. So, if you are like me, and you must have the proper tool for the job. And the job must be done right. Well then, here is another Milwaukee that is a must have! When you get it, buzz your name right into the outside of the case with your Dremel. And you will be set for many, many satifying years to come. Good Luck, and God Bless.	21
This item works as described. Most people do not realize that by reversing the metal plate on the bottom of this stapler, you can staple a page in a way that the staple pulls right out. Try it. Turn the plate on the bottom to the other side, staple a few pages, then pull the staple right out from the bottom of the pages without the need to use a staple remover. Reverse it again and you get a staple that needs a stapler remover to remove. After you've tried it, please rate my post as helpful!	17
I looked for a long time for a 'starter' watch for my daughter.  I thought this was the best of what I could find.  First the pros:  the numbers are large, the second hand is a butterfly, and it lights up.  Cons:  the wrist band is adjustable which really means that it is never tight enough and slides around a lot.  I was hoping she would want to wear it every day, but she really doesn't like that it's not secure on her wrist.	8
This peg toy allows my 2 year old grandsons to use new skills. They have to work hard to master putting the peg into the mat. The mat needs to be thicker which would make it easier for them and also keep the mat from warping so that the mat will lie flat. Overall, it is a great toy that could be tweaked in this way to be even better! I think they will play with this for several more years as they get better at stacking the pegs or creating designs. Great concept!	22
I started reading Water for elephants after watching the movie trailer. I loved it and after going to the cinema I have to say that the novel is really really better. There are more elements than the love story the movie tells. The historical period is described well, the characters are more interesting and Jacob's everyday life is one of the best descriptions of what an old man thinks and feels when he is far from his family.It's an amazing book and even if you're not an english native speaker (as I am) it's an easy read	5
I purchased this game as a kind of &#34;D&D; in-a-box&#34; purchase to play with friends, and it was a big hit.Pros:Lots of characters and class options-The adventures are fun and engaging-Easy to learn-Excellent miniatures and artCons:-Fairly basic as far as gameplay goes, not alot of thought involved.-Campaigns are artificially stretched by the &#34;reinforcement&#34; mechanic that lets you constantly add more enemies to the stage-Requires someone to be the &#34;overlord&#34; which no one wants to be.	22
I write and record my own music.  I stink at writing drums.  I don't play drums, I don't really have room for a drumset, and I really don't want to spend the money on a drumset to see if I can figure it out.  This is a great program for non-drumming, one man bands like me.  MIDI drums and the drum sounds from my Yamaha keyboard just wasn't cutting it.  It works with Ableton Live 9 with no problems.  Tons of different grooves.  It sounds like a real drummer on a real drumset.  Very easy to use.	16
I'm just a weekend wood shop warrior - not a pro. I purchased this because I always seem to be in need of more than one tool and this does a nice job keeping my hand tools organized (ruler, tape measure, pencils, small sliding t-square, etc.) and close by my side. Good array of usable pockets. Demerits for the hammer loops which should be stiffer than what they are. They work fine but I'm concerned that they may not hold up well over time.Still, I'm happy with the purchase and would recommend.	21
Just wanted to tell everyone that if they think the (WS) in the title means that this is Widescreen, they'll be upset.Anchor Bay DID release this on DVD before Disney did (as well as Condorman, North Ave. Irregulars, and Candleshoe), but Anchor Bay's release was full screen, and so is Disney's.As of this date (8/6/2010), there never has been a widescreen version of this released in any form, in any country. So don't get your hopes up.I think it's a pretty darn funny movie, by the way.	15
"""SPOILERS""I just got done reading all three books in the Vaughn series that are currently available and enjoyed all three of them.  My main issue with this one however is how quickly Candice gets over her experience of being raped...in one weekend she goes from barely being able to cope with talking to people at the gym, to sleeping with the hero...and it just seems as though it moves a bit too quickly...but the book was a good read and i'm eagerly awaiting the next one in the series due out early next year about their cousin Grace"	14
This book was a freebie that I got a while back on my Kindle.It's the story of a serial killer who travels the highway looking for hitchhikers. Once he gets them he enjoys killing and torturing them. After having enjoyed a kill earlier in the day, he sees a girl hitching under an overpass. He decides he's ready for a new kill. When he picks her up, he realizes she is not the defenseless female that he had thought.This short story is not for the squeamish, but is a twisted story of a serial killer. I thought it was a fun read.	14
Want to enter your car in the Car Show/Rod Run but it's picked up a bit of Highway dust and dirt?Assuming they have a car wash area (and many outdoor car shows do), hose her off, dry her up and pick up the Meguiar's A3332 Quik Detailer Mist & Wipe Spray and some dry towels -- one quick application to the car will bring her back to good looking glossiness, and you most probably will pick up a few extra points when the judges come around.Meguiars makes great automotive finish products, and has been doing so for a long time.	2
Chet Baker - Sings...It Could Happen To You. 180g vinylEvery trumpet player is really a singer...they just sing thru their instrument but on &#34;It Could Happen To You&#34; Chet actually uses his voice!This album is way too cool and relaxed.......lounge meets cool jazz !  On this album Chet picked 10 standards of the day and used his voice as a trumpet!  But there are no &#34;Bla Bla's or nonsense syllables here just Chets soft voice singing as if he was playing trumpet  .	9
I bought this DVD player and have had no problems whatsoever.  The picture quality has been flawless, as has the sound.  I have NOT had any lip-sync or fuzzy lines, etc.I have played both Austin Powers movies, Rounders, Contact, Pulp Fiction, and two Gratefuld Dead  DVD's, along with an assortment of audio CD's.It did take me a little  while how to figure out how to get the audio set up properly for 5.1, as  the default setup when you buy it is for just two front speakers.	10
This is a good app to analyze the wi-fi signals around you...and if you live in a suburb there will be many.  Just about everyone now has a wi-fi router in their home.  This app identifies every signal within range and can graph their strength.  This is good as you can walk around your house/ airport/ coffee shop/ whatever and find the areas with strong signals/weak signals.  The best part is the real-time graph which clocks signal strength over time.  You can even do a screen shot and send it via e-mail.	1
The feeding instructions for these biscuits are two/day for 30# dogs.  While it says for &#34;Small and Medium Dogs&#34;, it's strictly for medium dogs; I have two 10# dogs, which means I had to break these into thirds.  And when I tried to break these, these didn't break clean and tended to crumble.  So while they seem to help my dog with her knee issues, I would NOT recommend for small dogs.  If you have a 15# dog, you can break these in half.  Great product for a 30# dog, but not for 10# dogs.	19
This product arrived quickly and undamaged.  We have already utilized it multiple times (bread and pizza doughs) and it works well for our home baking needs.  The plastic handle is comfortable to grip and to apply pressure.  It also cuts through the dough easily. I am unaware if this is professional grade since my wife and I are new to the bread and baking world, but considering that we are true beginners, it is much better than we expected and makes dough working much simpler once you work with it a little.  I hope this review helps.	13
First. Let me tell you I travel and no. You can't plug your charger into a tree. That being said I love this thing. It charged my phone 3 times over all weekend. I had no problems with the size and having in my pocket next to my iPhone. The only thing I have to say i didt like is that It takes a long time to charge. But its a very big battery but it's ok cause thts what makes it awesome. If you travel or go through battery life a lot. This is def the product for you.	7
I have two dogs, one big and one small...they both love this toy.  Best of all, it's extremely durable.  Normally with squeaky toys I have to monitor their play with them because if I don't then I come back in the room three minutes later and they have it all torn apart, stuffing all over the room and have proudly destroyed the squeaker.  This one we've had for a couple weeks now, it's in their toy basket that they always have access to, they play with it pretty much daily and they've yet to destroy it.  Fantastic deal on this.	19
Bought for a 3 year old boy and he loves it.  Even I ended up trying to make some &#34;super fancy&#34; structures and there are ways of connecting the gears and pillars into non intuitive ways which increases the possibilities.  Each time I found out a new way to connect the pieces and showed my nephew, he would then try that combination to make new structures.  Hours and hours of fun.  While not a complaint, i feel that including two handles would have been a good idea.	22
These are great to have on hand for quickly wiping up anything germy or gross. I use these for going over the toilet seat in between scrubbings. I sometimes use them on the dogs feet, but I mostly use the Sensitive ones for them. These dispense okay once you get them going, but when you first pull them through the top, a few extras come out which is annoying. These are great to have on hand and I like the special designs they use on the limited edition packages from time to time.&#8203;	12
My intention here is to comment on the quality of this reading, rather than the timeless content, the quality of which is well known.I very much enjoyed Paul Sparer's reading. I found his rich bass voice and eloquent style ideal for Gibran and very pleasing to listen to. Unlike another reviewer, I was not at all distracted by the music; in fact, I barely noticed it. Taste in such things is a personal issue, and for what it's worth, this reading very much suits my tastes.	5
Although it was short lived on the series lineups, it had a good cast and script of action, suspense, and science-fiction to keep all those who attempt to make science work in science fiction, busy watching. Aliens and populated Earth bound ascentient beings existing over time has many philosophical brain teasers questioning whether we are alone or if your neighbor, loved-one, or friend are bit more than you think.  It's a great re-watch of Science Fiction made into a series that does not or should not bend your mind too much. Enjoy.	0
"We found this book at a rummage sale and found it to be so useful, especially when several people are helping with the baby (ex: visiting family, etc.)  We loved it so much that I've bought another one and have almost filled that one too.  I like having the room to write things about our baby's day and development, plus use the ""Notes"" section to write some story, etc.  It also helps ""Dad"" see what has happened that day and feels more connected.  I will be buying another one soon!"	3
I've been using their labels for more than 20 years -- they are SO easy to use on the computer, and these 08167 labels print equally well on my Ink Jet AND laser printer.Feeding them through a copier is a cinch too.These 08167 labels peel easily, the ink impressions are sharp and crisp, in color OR black and white.I have had no problem with the Avery labels' adhesive longevity in the past -- let's see how well these 08167's do -- I would think that they will be just as good as their predecessors.	17
As mentioned with the test strips [please see that review] these fit the Accu-Chek, meter with the built in lancing device.  They provide a convenient way to double check my blood sugar, against the One Touch unit I have (through prescription) and their lancets and strips [which are different of course].  Again, they take a little getting used to and making sure they are &#34;seated&#34; properly in the device is one reason I didn't give them five stars.  It's pretty much the same though with most of these.  Otherwise, they're fine.	12
My grandson enjoyed the Rover and was able to master the programming within a day or so. It works as advertised and is educational. But my grandson got bored with the Rover rather quickly.The manual is extensive but somewhat confusing. You have to program every command into the Rover. And I mean every command. This can be time consuming for a child, hence the quick boredom.Watch the height when trying to chase the cat under the bed. Our Rover got stuck then the cat attacked it with wild abandon.	22
"For me the lotion is too greasy for my face so I use it for hand lotion.  I also purchased the 2-pack of Eucerin Q10 Cream which is really good for the back of the hands and I will certainly use it for that.  However, the Q10 Anit-Wrinkle Sensitive Skin Lotion is just too greasy for my face which is already oily.  I suppose for ladies with ""dry"" skin it would be a good thing.  But as I've said I will use it as a hand lotion"	4
I think this story has such a low rating is because it was offered free on the kindle and people who normally don't read this specific genera put their two cents in.  Let's be clear...this is futuristic erotic.  And for its genre it is very good.  So if you like sci-fi, and you like erotic, then this book is for you.  Plus, the other three books in the series are also very well written.Don't let the low star ratings push you away from this story.	14
Without trying to be a real scrooge, I think BAMBI, although one of his most endearing films, is not one of his best.  While beautifully animated, the movie itself is slim on plot with a heavy handed message against man's pillaging of the forests.  But basically the story is Bambi is born, Bambi is a clumsy youth and Bambi becomes a noble prince.  The supporting characters, including Thumper, are not utilized effectively and there are too many long shots of the forest with accompanying choral background.  Small kids should have fun, but older ones may end up yawning.	6
This is a fun pick.  I play a lot with my fingers and thumb and thought I'd give this a try.  Its great!  I love the tone of this pick striking strings.  I love the way it transmits the feel of the strings.  More organic than plastic picks.  Yes it might crumble on you if you play too hard.  I think if you play as hard with this pick as you would with your thumb you'll be fine.  Its a lot of fun and for such a little price can open your playing to different tones for your instrument.  Worth a try.	16
I bought this from B & N and had to return it back in June and they have still not credited me for the return.  I have called them at least ten times over the past two months and have been on the phone at least two to thee hours each time and they have still not credited me yet for the nook touch.  I am now forced to report it to my credit card company and hopefully they can get some where with them.  Buyer beware where you buy your Nook touch.	10
"Highly recommended.  Just make sure it has ample water to get started (1 gallon minimum).  Used in warm and cooler weather without issue.*Update:  4/2014: after camping an entire season with these, I found that they didn't work very well.  Tissue and waste didn't seem to break down very well, and it most certainly doesn't mask odors very well.  I even tried using 2 packets instead of one (for a 30 gallon tank); no difference aside from things being very blue!I think I'm going to try the ""tried and true"" Happy Campers  Organic treatment next."	2
Really great book. The characters are interesting, particularly our hero Jacob. The setting is vibrant (a circus during the Great Depression.) The plot moves at a great pace, and the material is really well researched. All of which comes together under some excellent writing that provides just enough detail to make everything real and interesting without banging you over the head with it. Throw in murder, sex and a big elephant wearing pink sequins, and you have a fab book. The very end is charming too. I highly recommend it	5
"Soothing, tasty. Both the aroma & flavor are very good. It has a ""sweet minty flavor"" that is not overpowering. Definitely relaxes me.Too much mint and other potent herbs can flair up my reflux. Having GERD, i need to be careful about that and with this tea I don't notice any problems in that way.I have been a huge Yogi tea fan for years, but i don't i don't think their stress relief tea is as effective as this brand's.  This is my go-to."	11
Sorry, just saw the latest season 4 episode. You know, cobras and taints? Well my last review got bumped for a language interpretation - I assume - because I used the phrase 'Holy s*** snacks'. This is just a test to see if I get bumped again.Anyhow, outrageous, totally non-PC humor, slime-ball secret agent-ery, suave nimrod-ery, ribald water-cooler humor - I'm in heaven .... funny as a WHOLE BIG OL' box of sh8t-snacks ....  :)	0
"I have 19"" Aluminum wheels on my BMW.  I had the lip refinished a few years ago to fix some curb rash.  The refinisher didn't redo the clearcoat, so the wheels eventually got water stains on the refinished rim.  This stuff really worked well to clean it up.  It takes some elbow grease, but the results are remarkable.Beware, as it says on the package, if your rag doesn't turn black, the surface can't be polished.I didn't realize how small this 5oz package was though.  I used about a quarter of the tub doing four wheels."	2
This is a tough unit and critical to clean the windows of my RV and truck.  I am glad I bought the 'used' one -- couldn't tell it wasn't brand new!  The unit is a little heavy - but that's good for what it does.  I wish I could adjust the angle of the step plate though... right now when mounted it actually is ~10* dropped from level and I would not want to slip off this thing (but the louvers will preclude that from happening I suspect).	2
I'm a big fan of British tv, even though I'm American. I had a feeling I would enjoy Upstairs Downstairs since I enjoyed the new version as well as other similar shows. It took me a few episodes to get into it, but having finished the first full DVD I have to say I'm thoroughly addicted.As for the quality of the DVDs, they seem quite good. It's a nice set over all, and I was very pleased by Amazon reducing the price for a time to $77. Excellent!Another favorite Brit tv show to add to my collection.	15
i have to say that this video series is AMAZING!  i am a very visual person so i found this very helpful.  as the story progressed it was actually happening on the screen.  i had heard that it took quite some time to get the characters cast.  but it was worth the wait!  the people that were in this set were just great.  i can't wait to see the other series - ACTS.  in fact, i'm going to tell my library to buy this set too.	15
I really like to use mechanical pencils when I am doing design and draft work. Unfortunately they seem to get lost or borrowed often, so I like to buy them in quantity.Other mechanical pencils have the more convenient finger click lead-advance button, but have that inconvenient covered micro eraser and are much more expensive.These have the less convenient twist lead-advance system, but have superior large no-smudge erasers with no cumbersome cover and are much less expensive.For my needs, these win. For the price you cant beat them.Recommended	17
My older daughter was 8 and my younger daughter was 5 1/2.  We would watch this movie constantly for the next 3-4 years, my girls just loved it.  I thought it was an enjoyable movie and I didn't mind watching it so much back then.  I have fond memories of my girls curled up on each side of me, ready to watch Condorman.  My daughters are now grown, my older one just turned 40 and they still remember those days of watching Condorman... can't get any better than that.  5 STARS !!!	15
This album was haaard. The production is classic. Every song from the start to finish has tight rhymes. Spices flow was much more advanced from his first album which is a classic too. I can't sat how much I like this CD. I like what ant banks did with the 'george duke' sample on 'clip & tha trigga' too, since I used to like the original. This is essential if you want good westcoast rap. Also checkout South central cartels 'N' gatz we truss' if you like this. Peace!	9
What's not to like about Pinaud? Back in the day, my barber used to splash this stuff on me after every haircut and it always seemed to last the whole day without being overpowering. I thought this might be some cheap imitation, but nope --- it's the real stuff and I like it. They won't get a lot of money out of me on restocking though, because like the old slogan for another favorite of mine, &#34; A drop makes quite a splash&#34; and 12 ounces should last quite a while.	12
I've received my rod on time. well few days after I got it, I went to fish for some panfish, and what I can say about the reel is that works very good even for casting I've tried some spoons and it worth, and about the rod, it is very flexible I caught 2 largemouth bass of about 6 pounds ea. it bended like if will break down, but finally nothing bad happened,I totaly recomend this kit,it came with out line but is good after all.	20
I was a fan of Spark People until I tried to download their app.....they charge $$ for their app!  This one is free!  I have switched to My Fitness Pal for both my cell phone and Kindle HD.  I keep track of everything I eat and so far I've lost 15 lbs in the first month!  It's easy to use; especially the scanner.  Just scan a product and it fills in the rest for you.  I plan on making a lifestyle change by sticking with this app.  WTG!!	1

I was looking for a new chamois to replace the old worn out one I had.  I ran across the Absorber, and the reviews wore great on this product.  So, I decided to give it a try.  I'm SO glad I bought it!! It really is the best chamois/absorbent drying towel I've ever seen!! After drying your car (or whatever you are trying to dry off), just toss it in your washing machine. It comes out looking brand new again!!  You really can go wrong---buy this product!!!	2
This is a nice hose nozzle - simple design, sturdily made and inexpensive. It can go from high-powered jet mode to gently spray just by loosening your grip. It also doesn't leak at all where it attaches to the hose!My only gripe would be that when you use the widest spray pattern, it can come out unevenly &#8211;e.g., it's not an even &#34;circle&#34; of water coming out, which makes watering evenly a little challenging. But it's not a big deal.Get one, you'll like it.	18
what I needed was rewireable or pigtail 2-pin connectors but those don't seem easy to find. maybe if there was an RV store near me, but...but honestly finding this was even better. and the price is unbelievable.(what I really needed these for, is to cut in half and reverse the polarity. yeah, I know, danger will robinson. but it turns out that chaining up certain other connectors on my solar system results in wrong polarity in the first place, so to fix that... yeah, it scares me too.)	2
These speakers are extremely good. The sound is very clear, the bass sounds very natural. Get them. I found them incredibly difficult to find, I searched over 20 sites until I finally got them. Amazon totally has a monopoly going on.  But anyway, bottom line, get these as soon as possible, because I remember when they were available for like $80 and when I finally found them at like the 23rd site they were $107. But they were worth it. Maybe watch it if they reach like $200. But otherwise, yes.	10
It is as claimed. A light odorless lubricant that improves the cutting of the shredder blades. After shredding about ten bags of paper I used this lubricant and immediately noticed a difference in the sound of the shredder motor and there was no &#34;oil&#34; smell. A hint that I learned is to put the shredder in reverse and then apply the lubricant and let it run for about 10 SECONDS. When you puncture the spout be sure to use a small pin. If you cut the tip off you will use too much.	17
If you like the idea of trading cards, making deals, making alliances, stealing treasure, and stabbing your friends in the back you will love this game! Everything about star munchkin is fun! It is fairly quick, always interactive, and not too hard to teach to newbies. This is one of those games I have played since I was young and will always love. Try it out with friends who are willing to laugh and won't get angry when you turn on them last minute to win the game. :) Buy it.	22
The brush is made of a VERY hard plastic. It is intended to clean very hard areas, do not even think about cleaning something sensitive, this is for heavy use only.The Handle is a very cheap - but hard - plastic. One can easily notice the part where they got together, although I thought and wanted it to be wood, that'd be perfect.Bought to clean the studs on the wheel but not sure it it'll scratch them, probably not since it's just plastic. Looks like it will last forever!	2
If you're in the market for a portable CB option - please do yourself a favor and seriously consider the Midland 75-822.What makes this portable CB option great is that it is a reliable source for inside your vehicle - and you can just as quickly switch out of it and start using it outside of your vehicle.  Which is great when you are traveling convoy-style on a Jeep run or similar activity.  Does it work as well as permanently installed CB?  Maybe not - but this one has worked great for me.	10
I love this potty seat. There is no foam seat for the pee to seep into. Just two simple pieces that are so easy to clean. This was the best thing I could have bought for all of our potty training kids. The lip in front looked too high at first. But actually it is perfect. Perfect for girls potty training and for little boys. I would recommend this seat to anyone who has a little one potty training. I just might keep this seat forever....I will have visiting grandchildren someday. :)	3
This is my third pack; the 1st pack has been using for two months, the sounds are rich and full, and the feels are still good.  I broke the high E on the 1st attempt of restringing, and luckily I had bought 2 packs at the same time.  So, I want to keep a completed pack for back up.  I have been fingerpacking for quite long time recently, sometime, i will practice for 4-5 hours+ until i'm tired for the session.  I have used light steel strings on my acoustic, but these ones are easier for fingers even just tiny lighter.	16
Many people buy these timers for their children but I have discovered that they are also very useful to teachers. I use these digital bookmarks to time the activities we do in class. The timer lets me know in a very discreet manner that the time I have assigned for an activity has elapsed. It's easy to carry it around in the gradebook where it serves an extra purpose of marking the page.The digital bookmark is very durable. You have the option of exchanging the battery but the batteries the timers are sold with last a very long time.	22
I used the cool medium brown color and it's awful! I have medium brown hair and always use a medium ash brown color on it. That usually takes it 1-2 shades darker than my natural color. I thought Feria looked interesting because of the highlights. Well, it's trashed my hair. My roots are oddly lighter than the rest of my hair (lighter than my natural color)and the grey hairs didn't take the color AT ALL! So, now I have this weird looking hair color AND still have greys. I'll never use this hair color again.	4
Books and movies that are not predictable are my favorite. This movie took me awhile to catch on to the premise so I gave it a good rating. The beginning drags only because it is out of sequence to the story. It takes time to get used to the back and forth of the story line and then it hits you what is going on. At that point everything makes sense. I'm trying not to give anything away so details about the story won't be given here. I would suggest this movie to anyone who enjoys something different.	0
First of all, I paid 78 cents for 10 of these. Shipping and all! I would NEVER trust them to hold the weight of my cell phone. The string is about as thick as fishing line. The ring is about 1/4 inch in diameter. The loop is only big enough to put three fingers thru them. This was a bad investment but for 78 cents I can't complain too much. I just CANNOT recommend them nor will I ever use them. There are far better lanyards out there and for not much extra money. DON'T BUY THESE!!	7
"The product arrived as in the description, but I made the mistake to buy it for my Fender Squier Bullet (not a ""full"" Strat).There are 2 differences between this pickup covers and my Fender Squier: First, the magnet tips in the Squier are closer together.  I guess the fretboard is narrower than the Strats. Second, the Squier's has a dent on the bottom to allow the wires to go out on the side of the pickup.My solution here was to drill the holes wider and the dent. Not the most beautiful thing but worked.The other parts (knob, backplate and tips) fit perfectly."	16
Although I'm sure my local fire department will cringe if they read this, I buy these things for our backups for our fire alarms and they last over 4 years!  Wow!  Now if I buy a knockoff brand, or even Energizer, I can only get 18 months out of them before they start squealing to be replaced.  Plus, this 8 battery pack makes it awfully simple to have them around when it comes time to change them, and it's the right number for my house.  Love these Duracells!  Highly, highly recommend!	12
"Ok...I bought this and after placing it on my pedalboard it was OVERKILL. I mean I had enough boost and gain from different pedals already so no use for it at the moment. I gave it to a friend of mine that had a simple pedal configuration (distortion and a flanger) and it made a huge difference when he needed to make a solo or bring some ""accent"" to a determinate part of a song.It's a cool pedal but I will recommend it for simple pedal configurations. It will bring the extra juice you need.Cheers"	16
"Man, this is one great CD. This and ""Straight No Chaser"" are my two favorite Monk titles, and Monk is my favorite jazz artist. It doesn't get much better than this for me - until I came across this SACD hybrid version. I love it! They obviously remastered the CD using DSD (instead of just grabbing the latested PCM remaster and sticking it on the disc along with the SACD layer) because this CD layer blows every other remaster of this title out of the water. It's 1957, this is one of the first stereo jazz recordings made, and they got it right."	9
I saw this show on amazon prime instant video list, checked it out and immediately got involved in the entire 4 seasons!!  Did some binge watching, to be honest...I really enjoyed this series, it was amusing in spots--esp. Hiro and Ando and their escapades!  Season 4 had potential but apparently the writers knew the ax was eminent and while there were good episodes, just wasn't up to par with the first 3 seasons--but I know you will want to watch it once you see the other shows!  It's good entertainment, for sure!	0
Ridge Racer type 4 is fantastic.  The graphics are top notch. The soundtrack to this game is fantastic, with selectable music before each  race.  The girl in the FMV at the begining is even pretty hot.  Lets face  it the Ridge Racer is the origonal and still king of the playstation race  games.  Gran Turismo is just plain too complex to be any fun.  You have to  play Gran Turismo for hours before getting any good at it.  Ridge Racer is  just pick up and play,  try it out!	23
I think this is the album that gave Stevie Wonder the reputation that he had a really sophisticated R&B sound and that his music was really deep... and the album speaks worlds beyond this but I think that it really is a testament to Wonder that it is appreciated by so many different musicians alike (be it classical, jazz, or pop or all of the above) This album has the moog and electronic feel but it's so powerful at the same time... by far... some of the best tracking you will ever hear on an album..	9
I knew about Auschwitz, of course...conceptually I knew what had been done there and I knew the horror of it.  I just didn't grasp the full depth of WHY, nor did I realize how things were done.  This documentary series is mind opening.  It uses recently discovered plans and recreates what things would have looked like, it interviews people who made it through, it tells the story of the countless people who did NOT make it through and it helps us see with even greater clarity that this kind of atrocity must never ever be allowed to occur again.	0
First, this was not a quick put together as you would expect. The base seems very sturdy, but the shelves that hold the chalk, paints, etc are not very sturdy. They are fine for the products, but when you have three year olds they tend to put pressure on them and I am afraid they will snap off. Last, the blackboard portion is just a panel that fits onto that side of the easel. It does not erase very well. Putting that aside, I do think for the money the children will get hours of fun out of it.	22
"I bought this at Costco yesterday after trying a sample. This is something I will keep in my pantry. So good! Only 2 Weight Watchers points per serving. I don't like Indian food so I would have never tried this without sampling first. It just taste like a really good chili. My husband couldn't believe that there isn't any meat in it. I have friends on the Weight Watchers plan that also have to eat ""gluten free"" and I can't wait to tell them about this."	11
if you are a fan of hidden objects or ihog games from bigfish or Oberon then you are used to the great graphics like the ones in this game. however,  That's where similarities end, game is short &amp; frustrating. I completed almost  all tasks but couldn't change clock to 5:40&amp; therefore. couldn't complete game.  there are no hints or clues, if u are stuck google walk-thru for the game (its all text whereas bigfishgames walkthrus have screen shots.) &amp; you'll see where you are going wrong.	1
I like this brush, though I do wish it had a suction cup, or something, so it would be easier to be near the sink.  We lay it on the counter and let the brush part hang over into the sink.  It does a good job, though, even though the bristles are not as dense as other bottle brushes.  We had the other OXO brush with a stand, and while it was nice, the stand had a tendency to get moldy unless washed often.  For the price these are easy to replace when necessary.	12
I love Hank and Evan. I personally think this show is different from your typical doctor shows on tv right now. Hank is a doctor that was let go from the hospital were he was currently worked, feeling depress his brother Evan who is funny in the show take him to the Hamptons where everything change for them. Hank became the go to doctor who goes to the clients rich or poor and with the help of his brother the business became Hank, MED.  It's a very good show fresh and a little different for me.	0
Road warriors with a lot of gear need one of these. Not only can you plug this into your car's aux electrical outlet.This one is equipped with a hardwiring option so you can place it in the system with its own fuse block and leave your stock outlets free.I did that, mounting this outlet block inside my car's center bin to give me charging options for phones, tablets, Kindles, cameras, etc. that will fit inside the bin and charge there.YMMV but if you're starting with this gadget and install it correctly you will have the charging options you need.	7
Purchased this product to remove a minor scratch, it ate through my clearcoat and left me with $400 in damage. Had an auto detailer look at the damage before getting it fixed, he asked what product caused it and I told him &#34;ScratchX 2.0&#34; - he replied &#34;Oh, I would never even use that stuff, it's too abrasive.&#34;Bottom line, from my experience with this product: do not purchase it under any circumstance unless you are very experienced working on cars.This is truly a one star item. Avoid at all costs.	2
This product works to keep critters out of specific areas, but seems to only work directly where it is applied.I was hoping to also use it as perimeter control, sprinkling around my barn to keep out cats, skunks, etc. However as a perimeter control it didn't seem to work.When I applied directly to the corners in the barn that were being used for nesting it cleared out those areas, but the critters found somewhere else to make a home. I kept tracking these areas down and applying more repellent and eventually it seems the critters are gone.	18
The concept of this product is good, but I found the snaps extremely difficult to snap and unsnap (maybe they get easier with a little wear, but I haven't used it enough to see).  Therefore, I found it both quicker and easier just to take the mattress out all together and use fitted sheets (which are also more attractive).  I would only use this product if you have a mattress/crib set that have a fit making it extremely difficult to get the mattress out.  Seems like most crib mattresses slide out pretty easily, making this product pretty unnecessary.	3
"Depending on the apple you use this on, it will not be completely ready to eat afterwards.Sprays a bit of apple juice from the force when you use it. Put a plate in the sink and then put the apple on the plate and press down. Sprays a bit of Apple Juice ""Mist.""Depending on form of apple will be ready to eat. Otherwise must remove some left-over core with knife.Easy to remove skin after using with a knife.Overall good I guess quicker than cutting with knife."	13
I had the worry that the headset would not work with my SamsungT619, since the latter is not on the compatibility list. On the other hand, I've heard that all bluetooth devices with same standard (i.e. version 1.2) should have no compatibility problem. It turned out to be absolutely smooth when connecting to my Samsung. The headset can flash and even vibrate when call's coming.The headset is amazingly light weight. You can't even imagine a lithium battery is sitting in such a leather-weight body that can hold on for 7 hours' talking.I spent $10 on this headset and couldn't be more happy.	7
You can fly You can fly, you can fly!!!! Where the imagination can take you into far away lands you'll never forget TinkerBell! Don't we all love her! I'm troubled by the depiction of native americans though. What makes the red man red? I think this is the only set back to the film there's some prejudice there that I'm not happy with. Don't we all wanna stay as children? We all miss our childhoods. This film is by far one of the best films to relive your childhood.	6
I was so excited when I received these Wilson Jones Insertable Tab Dividers.  I have created a unique information manual at my office, and I needed dividers to organize the information into sections.  I have been looking at divider pages, but they are SO EXPENSIVE.  When I saw these Wilson Jones Insertable Tab Dividers for $2.56, I decided to give them a try.  They turned out to be EXACTLY what I have been looking for.  I liked them so well, I just ordered another five sets!	17
I recently had back surgery and was not allowed to take showers for a number of weeks. Sponge baths worked ok for the body, but washing the hair was a problem as chances of getting the water on the scar (and thus risk of infection) were high. I was miserable not being able to wash my hair until someone told me about No-rinse Shampoo.Small things make a big difference when you are hospitalized/recovering from surgery.  No-rinse shampoo removed one of the things that was making me feel bad and I am so pleased someone told me about it.	4
GoldenEye 007 is one of the best game's for the, Nintendo 64. When, you hear pepole say the game is Great, There not kiddin'.  I've had This game for a while, And I'm still coming back to it. It's an 11/10 Replay value. I'd give GoldenEye 007 more Star's if I could. If, you want a game that you can come back to, Year's later, And a GREAT game for alot of pepole, Then Get GoldenEye 007.	23
A very nice saw. Very heavy (which I take to be a good thing) and I went for this model because it has the electric brake (didn't like the idea of standing there forever waiting for the blade to slow down. The handle sits nicely in my hand and all in all I'm very pleased with it. I bought a better blade so can't comment on the blade it comes with (actually I have used that one once when I was ripping out a piece of old subfloor and was worried about hitting nails with my good blade - it worked fine).	21

I have a lot of rabbit and deer damage in my garden if I don't spray.  I like to alternate various sprays to keep them guessing.  This worked very well against both rabbits and deer.  I sprayed some potted begonias that had been eaten down to stubs and they are now thriving and the same with some balloon flowers.  I assume it was the rabbits that were eating them although I never actually saw the culprit.  At any rate this spray took care of the problem. It also protected my day lilies against the deer than had been munching on them.  Easy to apply too.	18
Picked this up from Radio Shack as a novelty item.  The phone is thin, but the call quality is quite poor.  Virgin Mobile uses Sprint's PCS network, and Sprint is my primary provider (I have a new Sanyo M1 phone), and the call quality difference is huge.  The keypad is also uncomfortable to use, like many ultra-thin phones -- just not designed for normal human beings IMHO.  Finally, VM's prepaid rate is just too high.  Coupled with limited coverage, I'd say VM's service is a bad deal.	7
People are right, this cd is a classic but I only gave it four stars because some of the beats on here just do flow right with GZAs crazy insane lyrics he spits on every song. Another problem is that there are only thirteen songs which to me, that with any rapper is just way to little.GZAs' probably my favorite Wu-Tang mc lyrical wise along with Ghostface and Ol' This happened to be one of my first Wu-Tang purchases, and I have to say, it won't be the last.	9
We had this warmer with our first child, but had parted ways with it by the time we had another child. We got the Tommee Tippee bottle warmer with our second child (because we used the tommee tipped bottles with her). After only a few months, I have gone back to this warmer. I love that it has the auto-off feature (which the TT one did not have). heats the bottles very quickly and you don't have to stand over it checking the temp every minute like with the TT warmer. Overall, I love this warmer.	3
I bought this as a fun game for me and my son to play. Boy was I wrong!! It's nothing but frustration for us both!!! The pieces DO NOT stick in the bugs and fall off easily. The legs are also horrible to put on!!! The rules of the game are ok but the pieces are absolutely horribly made. I would not buy this again.Also, this isn't the first one we got that did this. My mom brought one home from her work (she's a teacher) and it didn't work either. So it isn't just our version.	22
Our 6 month old outgrew her 4 stage bath tub & I wasn't comfortable readjusting it to fit a toddler.  This Eurobath is wonderful.  It is VERY roomy & baby enjoys splashing around. There is plenty of room for her toys.  It has a drain & I haven't had any problems with it.  It seems like it would have been perfect to bathe an infant too (since it has the special design to do so), but I didn't have it at the time.  I definitely recommend this tub!	3
I was happy to order this product. It got here quick. Saddly after 5 minutes the pump blew. I called pondmaster who refused to honor the warrenty due to the amount of rebuilt equipment comming from sellers on Amazon and Ebay. The seller has said they will return the money and refused to exchange for another product. I paid $10 for return shipping (wich will not be refunded to me) and still no word from the seller. I have had to call Amazon to make sure I get my money back. All I can say is BUYER BEWARE!!!!!!	19
Whiel the first season of Bones was slightly imperfect, partly due to the real geekiness of its actors, it was a pleasure to watch. Fortunately with Season two the craetors have managed to make this an even better series. Boreanaz' stigma of having played Angel in the Buffy franchise is now completely gone and we can identify him with agent Booth completely. Bones social ineptitude is also put more on clear display this time. These are the two main things that mange to make the chemistry between them even stronger than last season.	0
"Hey, it gets the job done and that's all I can ask for.  I tried several ""cheapo"" pedals, and this one was my favorite of them all.  While some had better casings (metal instead of plastic), at the end of the day I'm looking for a good sound, not a pretty pedal board.  The pedal seems solid enough, it doesn't take up much space, it sounds great, and it has a versatile range of sounds as far as tremolo pedals come.AND, if you are like the typical musician, you are looking for something that's not going to break the bank."	16
Arrive on time and as described.  I have yet to install but do not expect any surprises as have used these strings in the past.  I have read many of reviews on guitar strings as well as talked to many different guitarist.  Pretty well  all have their favorite set of strings.  What is interesting is they do not all agree on a specific type and/or brand.  So I reckon each has to find their own.  So far these strings have worked for me but am still experimenting to find &#34;the ones to love&#34;!	16
Havahart DO64MS Deer Off II Deer, Rabbit, and Squirrel Ready-to-Use Repellent with Battery Powered Sprayer. This product is easy to attach the sprayer nozzle on to the container. The sprayer reached a good distance and got into small places that other containers are not able to reach. We have noticed a decrease in the squirrels around our wood piles and bird feeders. There are still several chipmucks. I applied this around our pool deck to deter the deer from eating my plantings. My flowers seem to be lasting longer now. There is no strong order or unpleasant smell.	18
While I don't normally watch this type of British comedy, I was surprised to find it on Amazon Instant video and missing my British TV I decided to watch it and found it enjoyable. I just wish Amazon would get in more British programs like Midsomer Murders, Vera, Scott & Bailey, Casualty; comedies like My Family, Vicar of Dibley, Keeping Up Appearances or even older ones like Open All Hours and Are You Being Served.  Quality programs not over the top stupid like they have on BBC 3.	0
I've been looking for something comfortable to wear around the house and I've found it. I just had a baby a few months ago and I'm huge (42C). This fits perfectly. It's not too tight and not too lose and it provides some support. Not as much as my underwire, but around the house, it's great. I forget I have it on and the hooks in the front don't bother at all.It also keeps you separated... no uni-boob, which is awesome.All in all a good investment.	8
I have this playpen for about a month now but is still never used by my 6 month old baby. He cries whenever I put him in. I like it because it is huge and cute. What I do not like is that it lacks cushion. It is hard, not soft that I'm afraid when my baby rolls over, e would hurt himself. I am waiting for my baby to grow up a little more, may be he'll like it when he is already able to stand. I hope he would.	3
This is a fun movie, every bit as relevant as Saturday Night Fever in depicting the disco generation. Unfortunately the music here is not as good as in SNF's gripping soundtrack. Donna Summer is excellent as the aspiring singer getting her big break. Enough funny scenes hold the attention and it's perhaps a less sanitized view of the disco era than Saturday Night Fever, what with a transvestite shaving his beard in the men's and stuff like that. The actual disco here is much more impressive than in the other movie. Still worth a laugh or two.	15
Ok when i bought this video  i thought it wuz just pure music like led zeppelin live... well turns out itss more like a spinal tap than a live concert.. but it was ok .... i liked a few of the songs but like on rock and roll robert plant has a really low voice. but like i said b4 the video was pretty good. iguess if your a really big fan of zeppelin you'll like this cd but if your just a casual fan i'd skip it and buy the led zeppelin dvd if u want a video of them....	6
"I bought this album because of Mianfei's excellent review.  The cover photo predicted a mood like a refreshing dip in the river on a hot day.  Slint plays different music than I usually pop in the changer.  The guitars are dense like on ""Nosferatu Man,"" trudging through a wasteland of useless emotional baggage.  The vocalist talks frequently with the volume mixed low, creating a dreamlike effect as the sonic landscape unfolds.  I was glad to have explored this surprisingly powerful music.  Enjoy!"	9
Good for those small exercises that one can't do with freeweights. I use it for slight rehab on a knee. It's perfect for that. With the door stoppers you can get angles that really help (if you have old joints). Of course it's all very light, so I can't see doing anything heavy (for those looking for something to supplement freeweights, such as wrapping around barbells when doing squats and so forth) with these, but they're good so far and seem to be made to last.	20
This is a great clay bar kit at a good price. It comes with everything you'll need. 2 clay bars should be sufficient if you've never clay bar'd your car before, 1 is enough if you do so periodically (1-2 years). Awesome super smooth finish on your car removes pitted particulate and some swirls, but it does require good amount of elbow grease for great results!The application spray has this nice cinnamon scent to it, but I still don't think that that means it's good for you to keep inhaling it.	2
Wouk's The Winds of War is a wonderful piece of historical fiction.  Following the Henry family in their international travels in the lead up to World War II, the author's extensive research enables him to use this familial narrative as a context for providing the reader with a history of the events that lead up to the break out of WW II.  The characters are unpredictable and realistically three-dimensional.  The book was so good, I eagerly took up its sequel War and Remembrance the moment I finished it.  Highly recommended.	5
FINALLY HAD OUR BABY AND GOT TO TRY IT OUT..THE FIRST TIME I HOOKED IT UP WAS WHEN I RECIEVED IT, I DID HEAR THE NEIGHBORS MONITOR A LITTLE..BUT ALMOST ALL BABY MONITORS WILL HAVE THAT PROB. UNLESS YOU WANT TO SPEND ALOT OF $..BUT THIS HAS 2 CHANNELS TO CHOOSE FROM.. SO JUST SWITCH IT..THAT SIMPLE..I HAVE HAD IT ON FOR LAST FEW DAYS AND WORKS PERFECT..VERY SENSITIVE, AND ALMOST NO HISSING OR BUZZING AT ALL.. AND DOESNT NEED TO BE TURNED UP VERY LOUD..JUST SET IT RIGHT NEXT TO THE CRIB ON A TABLE....VERY HAPPY WITH IT	3
When my niece was younger... about 10 years ago I bought her this toy, it was fun  and included lots of shapes.I recently purchased this now for my 6m old and to my surprise it only has 9 shapes!  Holy cost reduction!!I liked this toy for the storage of all the pcs, they just stay inside and usually wont fall out.The color is kind of blah now too...Look for other shape sorters that do the same thing but offer more pcs, you're going to need them as they get lost VERY easily!	22
even if you are not, buy this watch.  I am a nurse, much like many of the other reviewers.  In fact, I bought it due to their reviews.  It is a fantastic watch.  Easy to read, has an illumination option and a handy date feature.  The only trouble I have is the size of the band (too long).  I will take it to a jeweler to take a few links out, however, the directions for doing this yourself make it looks easy (it's not).  Don't even bother looking for another watch, this one is a steal.	8
Danny was a hoot!  Took a chance and ordered this and I stayed up and read this completely.  Found myself laughing out loud because Laney was feisty and had a conscience.  Her boss was something else (can we say ho-ho-ho?)and I have to say I was pleased when she did slap him up awake.  His family seemed a little odd, but I guess he took after his father.  Would like to know why she wasn't sure about her family meeting him.  I really enjoyed this book and look forward to reading more from this particular author.	14
These pads are very absorbent and certainly serve the purpose, but they don't look very good after you wash them.  For the price I suppose you can't expect much, but the Carter's lap pads wash much better.  If you are going to get some, use them under things and buy the white ones.  The colors seem to show the pilling more.  I use them under the bassinett sheet now.  I used to use them on top of the changing pad, but my baby is only 2 months old and they already look quite old.	3
I know I should only do one star or five star reviews because those are the one that get read, but this book is really right between. So much so that I don't even know if I will read the next in the series or not. Science of Mars ecology and stuff like space elevator is interesting and pretty solid, which science on stuff like immortality treatments is just plain silly and puts everything else in doubt. Economics and psychology are really, really stupid. Characters are pretty dull individually but as a group, keep you reading. No real protagonists here.	5
This is a fine skin cream , it reduced pore size, improved my complexion's color and uniformity , didn't irritate it and didn't induce acne. I wear it daily prior going to bed and at afternoon if I am not going out ..definately improved my skin overall.Edit : after using this cream for more than 3 weeks now on daily basis I can say it has no effect on my age spots however, it does improve drastically pore sizes and makes my skin looks smooth and soft. will definately re-order	4
"TONI BRAXTON was a smashing debut CD back in the 90s, and still is. Braxton's unique voice combined with original, impossible to label songs like the sexy standout ""Breathe Again"" show what magic first-rate producers like L.A. Reid and Babyface can do with an extraordinary singer. Braxton caresses her lyrics with jazzy, Anita Baker-ish embellishments, slurred phrasing, breathy come-ons, and leaping octaves. She swings, sways, wails and wallops her way through this outstanding showcase. Beautifully sung and still sounds fresh as when it was first released."	9
I didn't like Parks and Rec at first. It wasn't until the second season that i felt like it all gelled and took off. However going back and watching the first season I appreciate it as an introduction to Pawnee, Ron Swanson, Leslie Knopfe, etc.  It is great to watch this season and see how they've developed and evolved from it.  Definitely a good purchase if you, like me, love this show.Also they have great extras and extended producers cuts of episodes. Definitely worth the buy	0
We have used them for three shows and a bunch of practices. Sounds great, looks great, the cable tie straps are nice and the connectors fit into the microphone nice and tight. Even fixed another bands vox mic connector, his sure cable was loose in the connector, this cable was tight. Has worked on...SM57, Nady Starpower, AKG 5800s, MXL 990, Marshall and Mark bass amps, and every one had a nice tight clean connection on the XLR's and on the numerous mixers. And yes COLOR RULES!	16
This is E.B. White's classic and timeless children's story in animation and music.  Charlotte the Spider (Debbie Reynolds voice) teaches Wilbur the Pig (Henry Gibson's voice) about life, and Templeton the Rat (Paul Lynde's voice)all join in the barnyard fun for lessons in friendship, trust, and love.  A marvelous film for the entire family.  It's a throwback to another age, this movie, and we all can learn something from a more quieter life, although in animation, it seems like the animals are just like us.  Or is it the other way around.  In any event, it's a fun film.	6
As I've discussed in my previous review of the same title,Innervision reputation preceeds it.The newly remastered version(8 of the 9 tracks appears in remastered form on At the Close Of A Century box set)also  includes a better packaging job compared to its first pressing as well as  superior sound quality that makes this sounds like listening to it for the  first time all over again.Like the rest of his 70s masterpieces(Music Of My  Mind,Talking Book,Fullfillingness...)this remastering project give his  music the respect that it has always accorded with the sound quality it  deserves.	9
This small battery backup charger easily fits into the palm of my hand and is not bulky in my pocket. The itorch charged my iphone in what seemed like record time.My iPhone contained 2% battery life when I plugged in the iTorch and began charging. After 1 hour 50 minutes with my phone still turned on and in use, my iPhone5 received a full charge. Once I confirmed the full charge, I noticed the iTorch showed one solid blue LED and one blinking, indicating a remaining capacity of 35%. I still had enough to charge my Bluetooth headset.	7
This book was very moving for me.  The way Gruen writes about the older character seemed so very well done.  Even though I am not old, I felt older reading those passages.  Gruen moves back and forth from present day to the past very smoothly and it is always a seamless transition for the reader.  Great story, good characters, loved Rosie the elephant. Very thought provoking and I really adored the old carny photographs sprinkled throughout the book.  Never thought I would enjoy a depression era book, but this one was really well done.	5
"I wish CTV would consider reissuing ""Sesame Street"" as a chronological series, starting with ""Season One,"" and working their way to the present... I would love to see the old episodes as they were originally broadcast, not with a few select bits chopped up into the new, modern mix. The old shows were so wonderful... plus that awful, whiny Elmo was nowhere to be seen! Anyway, that's my wish as a Sesame Street kid who now has a kid of my own... PS - yay, Ernie!"	15
A great disc by a great collection of musicians.  Cannonball often takes a side role-even as a leader-to the playing of others, specifically Miles Davis, yet the album has a warmth and atmosphere that are fully his.  'Autumn Leaves' is a stunner-beautiful and long with great solo work by all.  'Love for sale' is also very catchy-you will probably recognize the melody when you hear it.  I think the last track is supposed to be called 'Rangoon' but I'm not positive-it is 'Bangoon' on the back of the jewel case.  A great introduction to Adderley's work.  Highly Recommended.	9
Most of us don't know what to eat anymore with all the marketing out there, this book touches on a lot of subjects, I suppose it would be hard to go in-depth and keep the book under 500 pages.  I enjoyed it, you can read it bit by bit and look for certain information or you can go cover to cover.  An easy read.  It doesn't answer all my questions but at this point, I don't think anything will :)Also - fast shipping and a great price.	5
Yeah. Toothpicks. For $7 no less. What a bargain!!! And they are flavored? No way. That's so cool. Why didn't anyone think of this - well besides Joe in Middle School - with flavoring for next to nothing. But still, a seven dollar tooth pick is my idea of fun. And even better - if you get sick of them you can sell them on ebay as pieces of the crucifix that Jesus was hanged on (or the guy that played him in The Passion)	11
We purchased this for my in-laws for Christmas this year and played with my father-in-law, step-mother-in-law, brother-in-law (11), and sister-in-law (13).  Everyone LOVED it.  The game was quick to pick up and start playing as the rules are not too complicated. As we played more it remained challenging as we all started to develop more strategy.  Played with 6 people and the games usually averaged 30 minutes - about the perfect time.	22
Very convenient - I have a one year old and I babysit a one year old. I'm definitely not going to spend 100 bucks or more on a double stroller, but since I found two umbrella strollers on sale for 10 bucks each, my double stroller was only 30 bucks! It handles well. When you put the connectors on, make sure they're tight, and even so it will seem like there's too much slack for it to really move, but it does work. Just give it a go. :)	3
We don't have a deer problem but this product seems to work for squirrel and raccoon problems. We've also had problems with our cat scratching the paint off of our back door when he is anticipating his meal. I sprayed some of this on the back door and he has not touched it! I thought the battery powered pump was a little ridiculous but realize that some people may actually need that if they have problems with their hands. It seems to work just fine although you have to hold the trigger in for a while before it starts to spray.	18
The TV is still hanging from the wall so that's a good thing. The info for this wall mount says it is good for up to 66 LBS. Our old Phillips 37&#34; flat screen weighs 58 LBS (including the stand) and after 3 weeks the TV and mount are secured to the wall via a vertical 2 x4&#34; frame member. The mount came with almost every imaginable combination of nuts, bolts and spacers and straps to fit various size and brand TVs. I had no problem coming up with the right combination for my big and heavy old Phillips.	10
I was late to start watching the Closer on tv and no sooner did I find that it is a great show than it was in it's last season.  So I am so glad to be able to buy the season's I missed.  I go through Amazon on my Roku and the whole thing is just great.  It's a good show to watch and Amazon and Roku make it easy to obtain and watch.  Before then I was buying dvd's and they were over running my house.	0
These batteries have a specific use: They are the navy seal or special ops of batteries. You don't want to use them in your every day juicing of low drain applications. They are for the knock down drag out applications that other batteries can only handle for minutes. Camera flashes.  Remote control cars. High drain applications where you need a battery that can go in and provide high power for a specific use.They're expensive, they're finely tuned to provide maximum output for maximum time on high drain activities. Don't waste them on remote controls, mice or smoke detectors.	12
Major Peter Petersen is sent to deliver a message in Alistair MacLean's PARTISANS, but suspicion is the vital element that insures survival in the deadly game of espionage during any war. The questions is who is being set-up and for what reason, but then who is connect to whom by what ties.MacLean delivers an excellent adventure where Petersen is never sure until the last chapter who he can trust and who has more than life at stake.A good read at any time.Nash Black, author of QUALIFYING LAPS.	5
Just finished reading all of Kava's books; they were very good!  I am not a book critic; but what I can say is the entire lot of her books were entertaining and held my interest.  Anytime I pick up a book and read instead of doing something else in my free time is saying something!  Kava, Garnder, Gerritssen, Gagnon what a list of great reads for anyone that enjoys these types of stories....And the bundle provieds the ability to acquire six of her books for a good price!	14
This was a bit of a disappointment.  The performance was okay and pretty much what I expected but I guess I must have evolved out of liking this sort of music.  It is music; most of what comes out of the pop world today really can't be called music. Diamond performed professionally and sang well enough especially when compared to what the pop world churns out today.  The thrill of live performance was there in spades and that made it worth watching but it's not something I'll watch very often.	6
"Very solid food. Will probably last an entire summer in the size, and the bucket is rainproof. My fish seem to like it a lot and it doesn't cloud the water. I can't say it's ""improved the color of the fish"" as they claim, but I kind of find those claims dubious no matter who makes it so they can have a pass on that. Besides, I didn't exactly have a batch of control fish to measure against, so maybe it has.I'd recommend this food."	19
I absolutely had to have this game when it came out. It was such a great time when console games were finally living up to there arcade counterparts and even surpassing them in ways(MvC2 had better graphics than the arcade). In Marvel vs. Capcom you select two fighters composed of either Marvel or Capcom characters(or both). You can switch between them during the fight which hadn't been done yet on home consoles due to RAM limitations. Such a great game and I'm glad to have it in the collection because it's as good as having the arcade machine itself.	23
Bought the mount for my 30&#34; Dell U3011 monitor.  It fits the Dell quite well, and I bought it for it's reach from the wall, it's ability to manipulate, and it's weight capacity.  And in all those respects, I'm quite happy.However, there is a noticeable tilt/sag to the monitor when I have the arm extended.  I'm not so concerned with sag perpendicular to the wall, as that was expected, but the rotational sag that I sometimes get.	10
Purchased this Petmate Deluxe Fresh Flow a couple of weeks ago. It makes a soft running water noise, pleasant to hear. My cat immediately started drinking from it, as she loves running water. Keeps water fresh and clean for her. easy to reload - just unhook the cord from the plug and take to sink. Makes a loud noise when there is debris in it (bugs, food, whatever) to let you know it must be cleaned out! so much easier than refilling the water dish all the time...	19
First of all, the battery that came with it didn't work, so I had to buy new ones.  The lock switch on the spray head is hard to lock and unlock. It took awhile for the liquids to start coming out after I held down the spray trigger. Probably like 5 minutes. Anyways, once it starts, it work ok. Doesn't have much pressure to spray far. Anyways, after spraying like quarter of the bottle on my trees, entire backyard smelled like burned wood. I haven't seen squirrels on those trees so far and it's been 2 weeks.	18
This is definitely art in moving form.Mesmerizing.Capturing The Beatles during their very brilliant psychedelic period. This dvd is great for anyone who wasn't born, can't remember or wants to take a journey back in time.Though not a Beatles fanatic,I can't resist taking refreshing glance backward to a strange but wonderful place in time.'I am The Walrus'  played out by the band in beautiful,colorful clothes and egg costumes is spliced and put together in a psychedelic collage that's a masterpiece.This in itself is a reason to get this dvd.The whole film is spectacular.Highly recommended.	6
This book was highly recommended to me by women in an assisted living facility where I teach, for whom one of the book themes--aging and loss of autonomy--resonated deeply. I found it an engaging read, though the story almost caves in under the weight of the author's research. The characters are archetypes I had the feeling I'd seen somewhere before, lacking complexity, and it was ultimately difficult to care about any of them. The shifts back and forth in time were distracting and superfluous. I felt manipulated by the fantastically sentimental ending, but still, it made me smile.	5
I bought this changing table at a used baby store because I recieved the crib as a hand me down. Even being used this changing table is great. There are no problems. It's very sturdy and durable for the price. I have the shelves loaded up with alot of things and no problems at all. The shelves are made of a type of posterboard wood but they are sturdy. The pad that came with it is very thin and cheap so I purchased a better one. But this changing table is definitely worth the moderate price.	3
The listing for this item can be confusing if you are not sure what stereo XLR is.  Stereo XLR is meant to be similar to your stereo headphones, where left and right are separate unbalanced wires.  This cable is configured to be a stereo unbalanced XLR to a stereo unbalanced TRS cable.  This item is not a mono balanced XLR to a stereo unbalanced mic cable.A little bit a soldering can fix this connector by moving the red wire from ping #3 to pin #2 with the white wire.  Pin #3 then ties to pin #1 with the ground wire.	16
A clasically-styled and introverted album, Memory of Trees is a masterpiece of subtlety.  Many of the songs have an endearing shyness to them - soft piano and a lovely, quiet voice.  But within every introvert is an inferno, and Enya lets that fire explode on a couple of songs that absolutely burst with an expected raw power.If you've never heard Enya before, you might want to start with one of her more popularized works, like Watermark, just to play it safe.  But if you're already a fan, then your collection is not complete without this beautiful work of musical art.	6
"Overall, I'm very satisfied with these.  I originally had thought I'd use them for individual labeling of mail, however, my software doesn't allow for single print of labels.  So, I initially wasted an entire sheet when the address printed on all the labels.So, I've gone to using them for my return labels.  I use a Canon M83 color printer and they come out just fine.  I will say that ""virtually disappear"" is a pretty big stretch...to me the labels are still very visible even though they are clear."	17
I bought this DVD for Santana's Soul Sacrifice.  In my opinion, this is the highlight of the whole concert.  Michael Shrieve's drum solo is unbelievable.  Imagine 400,000 people dancing in a muddy field, all at once!  Crazy!  Santana stopped the show!  Ten Years After and The Who rocked the show too, and of course, Jimi Hendrix ripping on guitar.  I gave it 4 stars because there's too much talking.  Some talking parts are long and drag on and on.  They could've been replaced with more music.  Otherwise, a really good movie.	6
This is one of my favorite comfort series and is great for a good cheer up.  Hyacinth's life revolves around appearing &#34;better&#34; than her station would really allow and is hilarious.  Having someone of high quality nod at her in her mind makes her best friends that she can brag about.  Patricia Routledge is excellent in her role as are the actors her play her husband, friends and family.  If you haven't seen this show, you need to.  You won't be disappointed!	0
This is still my favorite Fall album.  It's the one I reach for automatically whenever I feel the need to hear Mark Smith drawling-uh like a madman, and to stomp my foot along with one of the baddest rhythym sections in rock while they pummel their way through classics like Cruiser's Creek, My New House, or Petty Thief Lout.This album goes all over the place, from spaced-out experiments with tape recorders and ambient noise, to goofy rants about not being able to get a beer on a flight.  Immensely satisfying racket!	9
I can't find this is ANY stores.  Neutrogena makes something similar in a pump, but I hear that it's pretty harsh on the skin.  I got this due to rave reviews -- and Thank You Amazon for carrying it --- and I absolutely love it.  I wear it almost nightly under my moisturizer.  My skin is smoother and appears fresher in the morning.  It did make my nose peel a little bit, but that's when I take a night off.  I really like this and hopefully can continue to buy this.	4

Everyone in our family enjoys this - aged 9 through teen years and to the adults.  What we love is how we can play together in competition while also working on individual goals.  Each player has to try to gather enough of the right colored cards to make train route connection across North America,earning points as your train route grows in length.  Players try to block each other.  Strategy can be simple for the younger kids or more complex for the adults.  It is best played with 3 or more.  I like most that 5 can play easily.	22
I made the mistake of thinking this product was minus SLS.  Otherwise, the product does as it states.  It definitely leaves my teeth clean, my tongue has become more pink since using it (I use inhalers for asthma which causes the surface to turn white - yeast).  Anyway, when this is gone I will try another Neem toothpaste when I find one without harmful chemicals.  Yeah, yeah, I know, I am using it.  I bought it and can't bring myself to toss it.	11
... titles in real-time strategy games.Starcraft didn't really set a new standard when it was release for graphics, engine and gameplay. However, as people played it they realized how perfect this rts title really was. Easy to learn, difficult to master. It retains its flavor and fun even after all these years and so many other titles that came out after it.A great sci-fi rts game that should be in the collection of any fan of the genre. Don't miss out and make sure you also pick up the expansion back: Brood War.	23
Haven't used it yet because I'm still looking for the interface to hook on my buffer wheel...I bought something for that and I'm still back to &#34;square zero&#34;...you would think that in the marketing of this sort of product the seller would fill in the gaps on the other things you need to hook everything up. Not sure I can use it without buying a totally new buffer (which I really don't want to do, since I just bought one). If you already have a hook and loop wheel on your buffer, this product may be just fine.	2
There are certain recordings that become part of the audio landscape.  This was one of them.  If ever there was a band that defined Americana in the '80s, it was The Cars.  And like so many or our aging and posthemous heroes, they passed into lore.I think the most enduring test of the greatness of this record is to play against what's spinning these days and it will still sound as fresh as the day as these Boston boys cranked it out....don't ya stop, don't ya stop!	9
This gentle and all-natural organic Havahart Critter Ridder 3146 formula repels by taste and odor groundhogs, skunks, dogs, cats, squirrels, raccoons, chipmunks and other nuisance animals unless they are starving or otherwise out of normal control, e.g. rabid.  This is not an industrial repellent working against anything that walks, but rather for the suburban home and garden use.  Its oil of black pepper, peperine and capsaicin are not offensive to people and applicable not only in gardens, lawns, and landscaped areas, but also basements, cellars, and storage.	18
please make more like this!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! xxx xxxx xxx xxx xxx xxx xx  xxx  xx xx x  x  x xx xx x x x  great game! way better than hidden object games.	1
This bra is beautifully made and quite supportive. I'm large-busted (anywhere between a 32DDD and H, depending on brand/maker) and chose to try a 34DDD for this bra since cups run small on most brands that aren't specifically for large chests, and this item doesn't come larger than DDD. It turns out to be a little large in the cup, which almost never happens to me! But the support seems good and the bra is both delicate and sexy while still providing coverage. I'll be returning for a smaller size.	8
As far as pop music is concerned, Depeche Mode is one of my favotites (The Pet Shop Boys is my other favorite).  Ever since Black Celebration (i am not a big fan of their earlier material) they have been creating great  songs with memorable music and good, at times very dark lyrics.  Although  many songs on this CD  have a sad tone, most  of them have positive themes  like hope,love, and gratitude.  Occasional touches of electronica are nice  too.	9
This is a great value. We've had it for a year and and it's still in great condition. All the colors are bright, nothing is peeling or falling apart. My only complaint is that some of the small states are oddly shaped because they are just too tiny to get right in a wooden puzzle like this. A few of them share one piece. If they didn't, the pieces would get lost, so I don't mind that too much. Overall, I'd buy this again in a heartbeat.	22
This is the only soap I use (with occasional excursions into pine tar soap, for specific uses... See my reviews on pine tar soap)I love the peppermint especially for the tingle and zing you get from using it!I use it as bodywash, shampoo, and to do dishes with.I've never experienced the drying effects when others complain of when using it on my hair either.Don't know if it's due to others not using it right or freak body chemistry on my part. Either way, I am a proud Dr. Bronners user!	20
I just reviewed the previous DVD release of The Car scant weeks ago......and suddenly, here it is...a re-released version for 2008.  No more paying silly money for this midnight classic about a murderous Lincoln terrorizing a Utah town.No details on what features, if any, this edition will include.  Hopefully, it will maintain the previou's release's picture and quality, and perhaps then some.  Either way, highly recommended cult flick for fans of the killer-car genre.  Features much honking and an array of movie-victim-fools who simply don't get out of the way when they hear it coming...	15
Does what it needs to do at an excellent price.  Fits well, seems rigid enough to prevent some damage, and the kickstand is a nice touch.  I don't know how well the kickstand will hold up over time, but works well.  The ridge around the front allows me to put the phone face down without it touching a table.  The case is pretty compact and still fits into the Smart Dock, although it prevents HDMI from registering.  So it charges and goes into dock mode, but doesn't seem to sit down far enough to engage the HDMI.	7
Having finished framing a room, I wanted a better quality of cut for  the trim. I replaced the 60 tooth Bosch OEM blade that came on my 12 sliding compound miter saw with the 80-tooth Forrest Chopmaster.  The cuts are glass-smooth, with no tearout.  You can see and feel the difference between the Forrest blade's results and the cuts with the OEM saw, even though Bosch supplies a pretty good blade for framing.  The Chopmaster was expensive enough to make me think twice about this vs. a Freud blade, but all the reviews have been very positive.  Now I can see why.	21
Other than the high initial cost (I got it before they put in a promotion, duh), i really love this compact and stylish phone.  It's the best Nextel has offered yet, although there's rumor that a camera phone is coming out soon.  If you can wait, wait a bit longer, otherwise for walkie-talkie style cellular, Nextel is the best.  No delays like with Verizon (up to 30 seconds!) or Sprint (10 secs).  Walkie-talkie that actually works where there's coverage.  I'm a happy customer.	7
works as it should..no problem..i always change the air chuck filler valve to the ball push on type..it a matter of choice..easy and cheap to change..don't like the lever action..because 1.its hard to keep on, slips off 2. hard on valve stem if its old 3.wrong angle...its a simple fix..plus the overinflat check valve is a nice feature..the last one i had lasted 5 years and i misplaced it..by the way i am a mechanic of 45 plus years..always looking for tools to make the job easier.	18
"I bought the Scotch Double Sided Tape to put up posters. I'm very happy with how well it works. The adhesive on both sides of the tape is very strong, so the tape will hold very well.It is almost completely see-through despite being coated with adhesive on both sides of the tape. This makes it ideal on clear plastic where it should be almost invisible.The length of tape is only 250"" (6.3 m) long, so these are pretty expensive! Apart from the price, the Scotch Double Sided Tape is perfect."	17
an excellent app to help optimize your wi-fi as well as be out somewhere and able to see what wi-fi channels are available and how good they are signal strength for you. definitely a must have app for mobile or tablet.  i use this app lots-at coffee shop area or in town finding wi-fi signals to use.  fun to also see all the  names and how good a signal you actually have with this app.  just a fun app to play with and use.	1
I don't see all the hype in this portable gaming device. The games graphics are so terrible (So is Game Boy Advance). The only good Nintendo graphics is the brand new Nintendo DS which has Nintendo 64 graphics which isn't too shabby. But I really hate the Pocket and Color because it's a waste of money. Why would you get something in black and white with terrible graphics and then get one with only some colors (It's not that good) and plus the addition of bad graphics...now that's what I call a bad deal.	23
This is one of the worst products created for child safety. It didn't fit our standard power cord, the front section opened really easily (actually had a hard time getting it to stay closed) and once we opened the back section to plug things in, couldn't get the back section closed again. Also, the opening at the top is huge! Definitely big enough for my 9-month old to stick her fingers in, which is kind of the opposite of its purpose. I sent it back and moved around furniture to hide our power cords instead.	3
Lie To Me is unique in that the science in the episodes is proven and real. The stories may be fictitious, but each episode is riveting and will have you stunned and on the edge of your seat. Everyone, male and female I have introduced to Lie To Me was an addict by the end of the first episode. I hate that it was cut after 3 seasons. Excellent actors, and has everything you could want from entertainment.... drama, comedy, suspense, you name it! I HIGHLY recommend it to anyone looking for something new to enjoy.	0
I highly recommend picking up a few A-wing's to add to your Rebel fleet! As with all other miniatures, the A-wing looks fantastic! It's a staple of Star Wars history, running and gunning with the fastest of the Tie Fighters and should be used as such!This wave 2 expansion contains all required dials, cards, etc, as well as new gaming elements. You'll get 4 new pilots, including Tycho Celchu and Arvel Crynyd, as well as several upgrade cards, a few of which are specific to this expansion.This expansion is well worth the cost, so get out and fight those Imperials!	22
I'm very particular about my tea and this is my favorite so I'm delighted to find it on Amazon.com.  Living in the back of beyond it is not available in local stores.  If you prefer tea bags with string tags hanging from them you probably won't like this.  Most Americans make tea with hot, not boiling water and then say they don't like tea.  Another reason, in my opinion, why Americans don't like tea is they were raised on Lipton tea.  If you are on the fence about tea try PG Tips with boiling water.	11
I tried the Fusion product and have now gone back to Mach3.  I contacted P&G; over my concerns and must say that you are totally on your own if you have a problem.  P&G; won't even take the time to respond to a person letter or issues related to their products.The Mach3 is a good, simple and straight-forward product that works well.  The price on all blades is so very, very high when you think about the basic components, but one needs them.  So, this is my preference.	12
First time reading this author she really goes into detail of characters and history of India. I will read more stories in the series  especially the one about the heroine's  sister. She did her best to destroy her sister's romance. I liked the last of the book better when Ash and her really became a couple and married. I was so glad in the end he spoke up for her and all the lies and rumors that have been told about her .They were allowed to keep the life they wanted after that.	14
This is one of those basic tools that belongs in every woodworkers/handymans tool box. I remember using this in jr hi wood shop when I was 12, with good results. A drill, some brad point drill bits, drill stops, dowell centers &amp; a dowelling jig &amp; you're all set to make a wide variety of very strong joints. There are faster, fancier, costlier &amp; far more complicated methods of wood joinery, but if you have more time than money then I personally believe that this is the strongest, most versatile, user freindly &amp; cost effective system going. Happy dowelling!	21
I purchased this allsop CD and DVD fastwipes, and cannot complain about the product for the cost and how they work, especially when picking up DVDs or CD's from the library to watch or listen to that have smudges that can break up the signal, and freeze the visual.  They do work but don't expect miracles for nicked or the surface film damaged DVD's that need to be tossed.  Recommend this product for a fast and time saving cleanup of your DVD or CD, I am definitely going to order another pack before I run out.	10
this is one of my all time favorite products. It really evens out your skin tone and makes your skin glow! I use it at night before I go to bed and when I go to apply my makeup in the morning after my shower you can really see how even this stuff has made my skin appear. I'm 34 with no wrinkles and a few fine lines and I guess I had uneven skin tone because this stuff will make your skin looking absolutely amazing! fast absorbent, no smell - great results!	4
I wish I understood why the Doctor needs to regenerate as often as he does. David Tennant, to me at least, is the best of all the Doctors. These specials are a joy to watch. The stories are interesting and the characters can hold one's attention. I miss this incarnation of the Doctor and hope he is still out there in this or some alternate universe battling Daleks, Cybermen, Weeping Angels and all the rest. Fortunately, this Doctor makes house calls. Once he does, you'll feel a lot better. Make an appointment and have him over. You won't regret it.	0
I bought this item on June 1 to soften my experience on the hard seat of a Dahon Matrix.  It works well, and far better than another competitor's seat which failed to protect my tailbone.  The problem is, after only 3 rides (about 50 miles total) it has already begun to wear out.  The stickers and wording are already almost gone...[...]...and the edges of the seat are already wearing out.  For only $15, I was not expecting miracles.  But I was expecting it to last more then 3 weeks before showing significant wear.	20
"The Vallejo CA sound was started in my memory by The Click. They combine tales of slangin' rock with beats that sound like ""Cutie Pie"" or ""Computer Love"". It is straight West Coast but even Eastern rebels can groove to cuts like Bumble, Hillside, and Its All Bad. This is something different, because 40 has a way with the English language that has never been done before this. Hiphop is lacking innovators and E-40 is the definition of the word, Love him or Hate on him."	9
Some of the pieces could have been put together before it was put in a box for consumers....The red bar for mom to push, for example. It came in two pieces. Really? ... The pedals were a royal pain to properly hold in place and push the plastic holder pieces in. And the foot rest for the baby? I'm still not sure I have it in right. It moves, and I don't think it should.That being said... Everything but the foot rest works on my bike. My toddler loves it! So, success.	20
This is a very good book. I got it this morning and just finished it. Once I started reading I just could not put it down. Well written with plenty of action. Nice to have an older hero wth vices of trying to quit smoking and holding his temper in control. Neither of which he does very well. There are other reviews that tell you about the main character and plot both of which are very good. I just warn you not to start the book at bedtime as you are sure to lose sleep because you can't put it down.	14
I ordered these earrings and received tons of compliments. I love them. The blue topaz is vibrant. Then one day I lost one of the earrings! I was so devastated I had to order another pair. They are so affordable-- that was not a problem at all! These feel so high quality, not chintzy at all. They look GREAT with denim and also are fabulous when dressing up. Very versatile. I LOVE these earrings and they are even prettier than the photo depicts.  You won't be disappointed.	8
"I bought some of these a few years ago just to try them out.  The ""gel"" in the name sounded intriguing.  These are OK, the colors are bright, but otherwise they're just standard plastic picks, which on an electric I prefer nylon because it's less ""clicky"" on the strings.  These are fine, and if I pull one out of my gig bag I'll use it, but overall there are other styles of pick that I'd buy before buying these again.  Nothing wrong with them, but they're just normal plastic picks, nothing special other than maybe the brightness of the colors."	16
"I was thrilled to find I could finally replace all my vinyl 12"" singles on 1 CD...but, not exactly ALL! There was a 12"" version of ""Say You Say Me"" (one of the biggest singles on this disc), that ran only 30 seconds longer than the album version, and my guess would be that it's actually the ORIGINAL length Lionel recorded, but was perhaps cut down for the original vinyl LP release. Wish it had been put on here instead of the 4 minute version, because I can't see it ever seeing the light of day on CD anywhere else."	9
I've had these tongs for two years. I probably use them every day and I love them. They are stainless steel and so far do not have a spec of rust anywhere. The rubberized grip make them easy to use and gives me a good cool place to grab hold of if I accidentally leave them sitting in the skillet. They lock closed for storage, which is also a very nice feature. I actually got them as part of a 10-piece utensil set and this is my favorite piece from the set.	13
"I have several Rollins albums in my collection like ""The Bridge"", ""Alfie"" and ""Saxophone Collosus"" but this one gets the most play on my system. Why?  It is a very free form Rollins captured spontaneously in the studio with probably the most empathetic sidemen he has ever had:  Shelly Manne and Ray Brown!!  A perfect example of this is when Manne completes the drum roll on his solo, Rollins duplicates this on his sax--pure alchemy!!  So if you're starting a Rollins collection, start with this one or ""Saxophone Collosus""--you can't lose on either one!!"	9
Seriously?  The Shure SM57 sets the standard, which by all other instrument microphones are judged.No kidding.  They work great with guitar (for a REAL acoustic guitar sound, drums, congas, tablas... You name it..  if it's an instrument the SM57 delivers.I hear it's good for vocals as well.  When the President gives a speech, the SM57 is there.In my experience a vocalist better have above average pipes to use the SM57.  The SM58 is better suited to those who lack vocal projection (most wannabe's).For instrument sound reinforcement...  bar-none... the best.	16
"This is a fictional news ""report - bulletin"" about an imaginary nuclear confrontation between terrorists and the police. It is presented as if it were ""REALLY"" happening...And...it is so good...that if you didn't know you were watching a videotape..you would SWEAR it was ""real"".ABSOLUTELY BRILLIANT!Right now, it's only on VHS but get it and burn it on to a DVD.Hopefully they come out with a DVD edition of this. It is one of my ALL-TIME FAVORITE VIDEOS EVER!I give it 5 stars ONLY because I can't give it more. It deserves it."	6
Bought this for my five yo who plays it in his class.The overall compostion of the game is so cheap. It is like it was made on a copy machine. The cards are paper thin, and will not last over time. After setting up the game, many of the cards were already bent.Next thing is that the directions are somewhat complicated. Maybe I'm impatient, but I just did not get it.There are so many other games that are truly educational and that are well made. I'm just not sure that this is one of them.	22
ALTHOUGH I RECEIVED MY SHIPMENT IN A TIMELY MANNER, I WAS VERY DISAPPOINTED WITH THE PRODUCT.  IT TASTES LIKE INSTANT NON-FAT DRY MILK AND NOTHING LIKE SOUR CREAM.  IT MAY BE OK TO USE IN COOKING, BUT NOT ON BAKED POTATOES.  ALSO, IT DOES NOT COME WITH DIRECTIONS.  IF I COULD, I WOULD GIVE IT MINUS 5 STARS, THAT'S HOW DISAPPOINTED I AM.  THE COMPANY MAY BE GOOD AND THEIR OTHER PRODUCTS MAY BE GOOD, BUT NOT THE SOUR CREAM POWDER.	11
"I got this product hoping it woud keep squirrels away from my bird feeders. I have six squirrel proof bird feeders. My squirrels, Mensa members all, have figured out how to overcome the ""squirrel proofing"" and eat the bird food until the feeders are completely empty. I placed generous amounts of Critter No-Ridder under each of my feeders. As soon as I walked away the squirrels were back and I could hear them giggling and winking at each other as they brushed away the No-Ridder whle giving me knowing glances. This is a genuinely useless product, at least as far as squirrels are concerned."	18
if it wasn't as long, tedious, or overly violent.  Look at the Bible films that were done in the past.  They weren't a bloodbath, yet kept you enthralled with good pacing and editing.  Those films were perfectly adequate and conveyed the message of Jeseus.The Passion, however, hardly said anything of his life or teachings; they assumed that you knew all about him, and just focused on depicting his death.  So if anyone wants to watch Christ get whipped senseless, scouged 100 times, and beaten to a bloody pulp, see this movie right away.	15
Great little cult film about a movie within a movie(which you don't find out about until 20 minutes in-very cool). Both Michael Lerner(BARTON FINK, SAFE MEN) and Zelda Rubinstein are effectively creepy in the movie that is being viewed by the theater which is taken hostage(sort of). My strongest suggestion for those who've seen the movie and are presenting it to their friends for the first time is to NOT tell them what it's about. Just say that it's better if they just watch and see.	15
"This was one masterpiece recording by JG to this day.  The songs on here just touch you in ways imaginable.  I got me going with some of my old flames from back in the day.  ""Provocative and Let's Get The Mood Right"" were two nice projects as well, but this one was tops.  Unfortunately, JG was overshadowed by a few other artist in the 90's.  I think we all know who they are.  But JG was and still is one of the great voices of the last 20 years."	9
We've had a great time as a family throwing this around the soccer fields.  Luckily we have a large park area with enough space for 4 soccer fields all together cause this thing really flies.  Its soft so that it doesn't hurt if one of the small ones misses their catch.  The hole in the middle provides a good way for someone to get a grip or to catch it ring toss style.  Light and easy to throw for all ages.  Get one of these, and get out for some family disc time.  You will be glad that you did.	20
"The vacuum does a good job and does have terrific suction.  But the hose is very flimsy and is constantly getting kinks (which makes it get REALLY noisy till you straighten it out).  Then the wand, right where you need to put your hand to grab it, has a ""Slip Ring"" which you can open to reduce suction (like for doing drapes).  Problem is that it's always opening up so you have to stop to shut it.  These two things get very annoying."	13
These little mic connectors are just what the doctor ordered, allowing me to spare wear and tear on my systems mic jacks; I simply unplug the cord from the adapter instead. And, they produce no audible hum into the circuit. They are unbalanced jacks, though (note the single black band at the end of the plug,) so if you need balanced jacks for your system (those with two black bands,) make sure you take that into account before ordering. By the way, I have both and there is no audible difference whether singing or recording. Just saying...	16
this is the worst bath tub i've bought. i returned this item right away. it leaks. once i pulled it out to be longer but, no matter how much i struggled to put the extension back together, it just wouldn't click. when i pressed it to lock the extension, i couldn't tell whether it locked or not, so then i put water to test the lock system. the result was that my kitchen counter and floor were a mess.now, i bought the Euro bath. it does a good job.	3
This is with out a doubt is one of the worst Christmas movies I have ever seen!  My daughter liked it because it had a snowman in it, but that's the only reason.  The movie is filled with overdone, unrealistic, trite political issues of the 90's.  It was too complicated for a small child to follow and there was barely even a plot.  Only get this if your child is in love with snowmen and you've exhausted all other viewing avenues.  There was nothing original in this movie that wasn't absurd.  The original Frosty is so wonderfully simple, buy that one instead.	15
If you seem to be having issues, it may be your phone. They say that any Android is a good Android, but they say a lot of things. Much like anything else, if you buy something cheap, it will work like something cheap. Also, people need to learn their phones. no matter what anyone tells you, they don't REALLY think for you. Anyway, this works great on the Samsung Fascinate, and even if it didn't, I'm not the type to complain about something free. People today.....I swear. LOL	1
I bought this camera about 5 months ago and was really excited, considering this was my first web-cam.  It has worked reasonably well throughout this time.  The only complaint that I have with this cam is that  when I activate the camera software it deactivates my Internet connection.  Other than that it has been a great camera for not only the advanced user  but also the novice.  The picture quality is not bad and for the price you  really can't ask for much more.  As for the software it was also easy to  install and to use.	10
I thought that it really worked, but  I speak Spanish so my kindle language is Spanish , I started to run the app and it showed some words in Spanish, I thought &quot; oh the app is on English-language but it shows Spanish words, it works&quot; , but then I changes the language of the kindle to English and rebooted the kindle, what happened? Now it shows only words in English. Do I have multilingual ghosts in my apartment? I don't think so, however it's a good app	1
Don't let the almost clinical look of the packaging fool you.  This is NOT some sort of strictly medicinal tea.  The flavor is awesome!  If sweet and spicy ginger is what you are looking for, buy this product.  While it does offer some medicinal benefits, I buy it for the flavor.  There is so much ginger, that you will find little pieces of the stuff collected at the bottom of your cup.  When I brew large amounts of chai tea, I always include a few bags of this for some added kick.	11
I was Eager, so I took this test 4 days before we could start saying I'd missed or was late...The faintest of faint lines appeared... a line, is a line and it was a positive line!  My husband was skeptical... so I waited 2 days and took another one... the line was VERY CLEARLY there this time... and we were pregnant. For fun, we tried other leading brands that can detect early... and got a 'Not Pregnant' indicator... so... in my books, First response, is about as FIRST response as you  get... b/c we were infact pregnant :)Goodluck!!!	12
Item does work well as far as sound quality and setup ease. However ear loop is basically not adjustable at all, consequently making the ear piece itself to constantly work its way out of my ear and feel as if it were just hanging there... After days of pushing ear piece back into my ear canal and hoping the loop would give a bit. i returned it for exactly those reasons... Great sound quality and no one i spoke to claimed to hear any distortion. just didn't fit well with no possible adjusting available...	7
I hadn't played Boggle in decades and then my dear friend brought out her original boggle set and we started playing all the time.  I was so excited to get my own and therefore bought this one.  I really enjoy it and how it stimulates my brain.  What I also love about it is that my 7 yr old loves it!!  The first time he played he only saw one word, but he didn't give up and now he can find up to ten.  He's even finding words I didn't!  This game is fun and educational.  My family plays it at least weekly.	22
This is great, don't expect the wax to last super long as with any wax and wash, and I do not notice any super shine or water beading, but I wax parent's cars after and what wax and wash does actually have the wax part do as good as if you applied the wax separately? none, but its better than just a wash alone. but it is a great bonus up from a a regular car wash liquid since it gives your car a nice shine. It also smells nice and is not too exepnsive	2
I've tried more expensive lotions and creams on my face, but I really love this one. It leaves my face feeling and looking very soft. I also love the way you just pump the top and the moisturizer comes out....you don't have to dip your fingers in a jar or touch what's left in it. All creams and lotions and such should be this way...I hate having to dig out cream in a jar with my fingers not knowing if I've left any germs in the remaining cream. I recommend this.	4
Perhaps these look better in smaller sizes.....I wear a 9 1/2 to 10M.  These looked so, so dorky on, I can't wear them.  They're very old lady-ish. Also, the collar of the shoe sticks out at the sides on me.  It isn't snug or even close to snug around my ankle area. It's not a stable sneaker...my foot was sliding around a bit, & yes, I had the correct size. I'd have to wear a thick sock, which would really push the dorkiness factor over the top.	8
This novel tells the story of a man who is now old and struggling with health problems. A carnival comes to town and he remembers the amazing life he once had. I loved the ending the most and hated when characters died. The story itself was believable and the characters complex. This book is not for children and can leave you quite depressed at certain points. Other than that [and that's more of an observation than a complaint] this is a solid read. If the characters didn't die this would've been a 5.	5
This stuff works - is all I can say about it. I bought some used rims that had brake dust literally caked onto the wheels. I really didn't think this stuff was going to work, but it did! Note, I did use a brush for physical agitation after spraying the wheels with this. I don't think this is the kind of thing you can spray, let sit and just rinse away the brake dust if it's pretty severe. For light circumstances, I think that would work fine.	2
I was going to watch a television show but I had some time before it started so I got my kindle and found this app and started playing.  What I thought would be ten minutes turned out to be my whole movie and I turned out being some sort of whiz at it as I got on some kind of top performer list.  That is not what they call it but I can't think of the correct name but I am number six on the list of people playing!  Give it a try!	1
"This is a MINI processor, and that's why I bought it...NOT to do the big jobs, I have the ""big boy"" to do that.  I do like the how handy it is to do the small jobs, so I don't have to use the big one.  I use it a lot to make home made dressing.  Clean up is easy and quick, as is the machine.  It will scar the bowl if you try to grind hard spices, etc. however...but it states that in the manual."	13
The expansion pak is the best thing since sliced bread. It is the item that revived the 64 after Dreamcast (RIP) debuted. It makes the graphics even more superior, finally putting the PSX to shame. It also helped to create enormous games, such as the excellent Majora's Mask and Perfect Dark. But here's the twist. If you don't allready have a pak or Donkey Kong 64, I would suggest you purchased them as a bundle at the very low price of ..., a steal from the Expansion Pak at ....ac	23
Maybe I'm stupid, but it took me awhile to figure out how to read it -- the instructions weren't that clear to me. It finally dawned on me after a few hours.The indicator is basically a 'doughnut', divided into 4 equal segments. The center of the doughnut is the 'reading' section. You compare the color of the center with the outer 4 segments. Duh! Okay, I'm good now.It's unobtrusive, but easy to see. I haven't noticed a change in color yet, which is a good thing. Keep in mind, that it won't read accurately under a certain pH level.Recommended4 Stars.	19
This is a greatest-hits grab bag of 25 stories from the Grimm's Fairy Tales collection, unillustrated, and apparently taken from the 1884 Margaret Hunt translation. Good collection of the highlights, but there are more complete collections (for example,Household Tales by Brothers Grimm) available for free in the kindle store.List is:The Goose-GirlThe Little Brother and SisterHansel and GrethelOh, if I could but Shiver!Dummling and the Three FeathersLittle Snow-WhiteCatherine and FrederickThe Valiant Little TailorLittle Red-CapThe Golden GooseBearskinCinderellaFaithful JohnThe Water of LifeThumblingBriar RoseThe Six SwansRapunzelMother HolleThe Frog PrinceThe Travels of Tom ThumbSnow White and Rose RedThe Three Little Men in the WoodRumpelstiltskinLittle One-eye, Two-Eye, and Three-Eyes	14
Banjo Kazooie is a game I've played many times since I got it in the early 2000s and while its fun, its not the most entertaining game I've played. There's two main objectives in Banjo Kazooie: hunting and gathering. You hunt for these jigsaw pieces called Jiggys to help you complete jigsaw puzzles to open worlds. You gather all sorts of items within each level like musical notes, Jinjos, Mumbo tokens, feathers, etc. This concept gets boring after awhile but nevertheless the game is pretty fun as a whole. I'd recommend the sequel, Banjo Tooie, instead as its 10 times more entertaining.	23
One of the greatest folk records out there. Not much else needs to be said. We lost a genius to an overdose. Not really appreciated in his time but this record will stand forever as long as it is available to listen to. The stark and fluid guitar work is contrasted with a voice so soothing, so troubled, and so damning of the culture around it. I can't really say much more. This record is an outstanding piece from one of our greatest musicians. The remastered tracks sound every bit as good as they should. Perfection.	9
I do!  The story had me hooked - I felt like I was a part of this exotic traveling troupe and despite the horrors and sadness in it, I couldn't be pulled away.  Especially heart-rending was the author's detailed depiction of the heavy-laden post-depression days and what one tragedy can do to a person: turn his life upside down. The storyline had my emotions wrapped up in the circus, and in the next moment, broke my heart for the lonely old man in a nursing home.  Excellent read that pulled me in and caught my breath.	5
Well, if you like reading about erotic threesome encounters with two hunks than this is the book for you. Most of it was not practical being the ladies first encounter but it is short and sweet.  I would have liked to pay less to read it but what else is there to do on a  rainy afternoon. I would have liked a much longer book with more of a story line with the erotosism sprinkled throughout instead of on every page.  I may look into the rest of the series to see if it all ties in. Enjoy.	14
The storyline was very unique.  I am not going into the plot, because others have described it.  What I DIDN'T LIKE, was our H was nothing but a bully and was very demeaning in the first half of the book towards our h.  What I LIKED about the story, was the sex,  it was raw, very imaginative, and hot.  There was somewhat of a  story, in between the sex.  I didn't feel a connection to any of the secondary character's to read the rest of the series.  The next book is only 96 pages and is $2.99, at least this one was free. (ljb)	14
Great features - except for the phone one.  Seriously - Bluetooth, IR, good phone book features, nice color display (though it washes out if you are using polarized glasses).  However, I get much weaker signals (and call quality) on this phone vs. my previous one.  If everywhere you would use the phone has strong signals, you may be just fine - but if you are on the edge, this is not the phone for you, unless you value the non-phone features more than it working as a phone. :)	7
I own &quot;Characters&quot; on vinyl. There are two songs on Side 1 that i feel are really great and fun to dance to. I'm talkin about &quot;Dark N Lovely&quot; and &quot;In Your Corner&quot;. Whenever i'm in a really bad mood or if i have one of those days where it feels like it can't get any worse, i just play those 2 songs back to back and then...instant good mood. I would suggest buying this cd just for those 2 songs alone. I'm gonna go listen to the rest of the album now...	9
"I applied the cream correctly every time, and it soothes effectively and provides a protective barrier for the skin, BUT does not deliver moisture to the skin The product doesn't have much moisture in it in the first place because it is ""concentrated"" apparently but i need moisture!! WHY ELSE WOULD I BUY HAND CREAM? obviously i want to moisturize my dry hands.The texture is grainy, I'm guessing it's the concentrated bits of dried cream or something, but it's very unpleasant feeling. It smells like plastic even though it's fragrance free."	4
Overall a great sander. I have dropped,stepped on and kicked this tool(not on purpose but I have very small shop)and it keeps on going. The case has stayed in great shape and I use the sticky backed sandpaper and the pad has not come apart. I would give it 5 stars but the on/off button is hard to work. It is sealed in a rubber cover and when you turn it off sometimes it comes back on because the cover causes you to think you fully depressed the switch when in fact you only pushed part of the way.	21
"The amount of ""paint"" was pretty minimal given the amount needed to really make designs or pictures.  The palette ""hand"" was a waste entirely.  It isn't meant to float, its too big for the side of the tub or the corners of it and not many toddlers are going to want to finger paint and have the coordination to do so without tipping it over.My son found this to be fun, I found it to be a waste of money in terms of length of play.  Bathtub crayons last longer, are less costly and have more options."	22
I agree with all the reviews that say the band on this bra runs small.  For comparison's sake, I am usually a 38 band and I have the Champion 1602 that is a 38ddd.  I measured it against this bra and it was the same length as the 44!  To me that's a huge difference. But when I tried on the 44ddd of this Wacoal it did not feel secure, so maybe the short length has something to do with the stretch of the material.  It didn't seem a lot stretchier than my Champion though.	8
I've had this charger for over three years and it still works like a charm. Love that I can plug dual items into it while I am driving and it's great for long road trips when you need to plug in multiple things at one time. Would highly recommend it to anyone looking to charge ANYTHING that takes a USB port. Description says iphone 5, 5S, and 5C, but I've plugged in all sorts of things that have a USB charger and it works great.Worth the money!!	7
I bought the 12&#34; size 6 years ago and they are still serving me well. I just bought the 16&#34; & 9&#34; sizes for almost $30 and if they are as good as the older 12&#34; ones, I'm OK with spending that coin. They are easy to clean, do not rust, and the locking mechanism is super nice! Cheap tongs with that cheesy metal slide annoy me to no end as they enviably slide down and lock the tongs when I need to pick something up. Spontaneous locking is not a problem with these.	13
I love these tongs.  OXO makes wonderful products, they are ergonomic so they aren't hard to use.  These are heaven sent.  The rubber handles keeps you from burning your hands when you accidently leave them in a hot skillet or on a hot stove.  They also lock, which is a nice feature for when you want to put them away.  I love this tool.  You can sautee with these, use them while tossing pasta or salad, or when you need to move a hot lid.  I can't say enough nice things about these tongs, I use mine every day.	13
...and the episodes for this season got stronger and stronger throughout the season. Epilogue is an excellent episode.I thought this series ended too soon. It had fantastic talent not only in front of the camera, but behind it too.It was my favorite of the three SG series.It is good to see that the talent has gone on to other shows like Once Upon a Time, Longmire, and Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. that are successful.I highly recommend SG:U for your viewing pleasure. It is great TV.	0
"After reading the book by Michael Lang, the man who thought this whole festival up..("" the road to Woodstock""), it put it all in perspective for me! Watching the artists perform was simply amazing! I loved it!! The music.. the People.. the interviews have brought me right there! I still can't get Richie Havens Out of my head And that's a beautiful thing! Nor Santana for that matter!! They laid the groundwork for the vibe that was the Woodstock Festival. 10 stars!!"	6
I chose this rating because of the grammatical errors as well as the punctuation errors. I have only been reading this genre for about two years and I have to say that this is the first time I have read about this type of zombie. I don't want to write spoilers so I'll say nothing about them. One of the problems I had was it felt like a spoof, not an edge of your seat zombie thriller. However, the characters were engaging and well developed, I liked many and hated some. This is just one opinion, check it out for yourself.	14
For years I have taken a b-complex vitamin, but was interested in these because of the added ingredients to combat stress.  I haven't had any problems with the quality of the product as other reviewers have reported.  When I received the bottle it was smashed in the package, but I contacted Amazon and they replaced it immediately.  I had a new bottle the very next day.  I'm kind of on the fence as to whether or not the product is helping.  I can't say that they are much different from the b-complex vitamins I used to take.	12
i dont think there's anything better on the market,man...this is some awesome stuff.he has guests like snoop,nate dogg,method man,dr.dre in their earlier days.the opening track,ambition az a ridah,has almost the tightest beat ever in rap music,plus its got that &quot;i cant deny it,im a straight ridah&quot; fabolous used on his hit.skandalous and all bout u have sweet hooks sung by nate dogg and the usual rockin verses by pac.after that we got the hardcore songs like #4,#6,and no more pain,plus the bangers heartz of men,how do u want it,and cali love.must have record the second disc is a bit more personal,but stilltight.recommended	9
I got sick of xbox 360 microphones breaking, so I decided to buy this to see if it would work.Unfortunately it didn't work that well. I got sound and the microphone worked but I got a lot of feedback and echo. Worst of all it was supposed to block outside sound, but it didn't do this at all.I know that it was designed for xbox so I am not going to give it 1 star. I don't have a home phone so I haven't tried it for that.	7
After seeing the recent major movie, I was prompted to pursue re-reading the original series of novels. I found them to be highly entertaining and as captivating as when I read them long ago. The writing is good, if a bit 'dated', but Burroughs can still hold your attention. His writting may seem a little juvenile to some but I (at 70+) was thrilled time and again as I read them on my KIndle. I recommend them to all who simply wish to read a series purely for the entertainment value.	14
I love this and my Sphynx cats do too, but the big drawback is that it feels like a rock and doesn't soften up. The cats would like it better if it were soft.  Follow the instructions carefully-I was concerned that my Sphynx might get burned so I put an extra cover on it.  Saying that, I want to emphasize that the warmer does not come out of the microwave hot-it comes out nice and warm and is able somehow to maintain that warmth for maybe 10 hours.	19
hmm Im not getting the salad drying efficiency that everyone else is claiming.  I had a generic cord one for years, and one rip on the cord and it spun fast and got all the liquid off.  This one I sit there pressing the button repeatedly and some liquid comes off.  I guess it's better than nothing.  It looks like it's working properly.  It spins fast.  It just doesn't seem to dry as well.  Maybe im picky I dunno.	13
The DEER OFF is relatively easy to use.  I do wear gloves though because absorption of the chemicals isn't a good idea, and occasionally there is drippage in addition to just wind dispersal.I used this product on my front garden, and honestly the results weren't conclusive.  Some plants seemed to benefit.  Others did not.I will give it another season to see if I can narrow in on effectiveness.  BUT I will note that while I saw bunny droppings in the yard, I have not seen them nibbling in the garden proper.	18
I got this to replace a smaller but heavy steel ladder that was starting to rust.  This is no lightweight, but the wheels make it easy to move, and it feels very strong.  Our main use will be trimming some trees, and picking some fruit.  We haven't used it yet but it promises to be very good for what we want to do..It comes with an instruction manual and a dvd that shows just how to use it.  The adjusting mechanism is very simple, much better than what I had on the old ladder.Shipping and packaging were very good.	21
You can tell these are quality grills; otherwise Weber wouldn't give these a 10 year warranty. My 20 year old Smokey Joe recently came to its demise and there was no doubt I'd purchase another. The only difference is they now have a nylon handle instead of a wooden handle. I keep mine outside on a patio 24/7/365 and it weathers the elements without covering it. I also use mine on an old metal wrought-iron table to make for safe grilling. This is the perfect size for 1-3 people.	18
For pancakes, this iron griddle heats slowly and evenly, and it holds the heat better than a teflon griddle but...you...must...season this and instruct well-meaning helpers NOT, repeat, NOT to use any soap of any kind, sponge, steel wool pad, on the griddle. Ever. If you are worried about cleaning it, you can scrub the surface with a hot, clean water, handful of cooking salt and a clean paper towel. After seasoning, pancakes cook evenly and this is wide enough to go over two burners and really get some production going at breakfast. Just remember about the seasoning and the No-Soap.	20
I like these things and got them to place under the scissor stabilizers.  The only reason I rated them at four stars is that they are a little bit smaller than the stabilizer pads, which I didn't realize when I ordered them (didn't compare sizes).  That means they can dig into the ground a little more due to more pressure.  I have had to adjust the stabilizers sometimes because of that.  The underside is a squared web design that also allows for ability to &#34;sink&#34; into the ground.	2
Too $hort is the biggest pimp ever and always will be. Even though he doesn't rap about much else, for some reason it never gets old listening to Short dog. Possibly because Ant Banks provides some of the funkiest beats, or maybe it's Too $hort's delivery and voice, but I will never get tired of listening to Too $hort. This album is his best, edging out Life is Too Short and Cocktails. It has the best production and Too $hort and company drop hot lyrics over the beats. Bay Area rap doesn't get much better.	9
I used this pad to applyMeguiar's M10532 Ultra Cut CompoundandMeguiar's M20532 Ultra Finishing PolishusingMeguiar's G110v2 Professional Dual Action Polisher.The pad stayed on the polisher (hooks and loops system) and followed contours of my car's body well.  I only had one pad and had to wash it after using Ultra Cut Compound and before using Ultra Finishing Polish.  I attached the wet pad to the DA polisher and turned it on to spin the water out of the pad.  The pad did not fly off.I am very satisfied with this pad.	2
This tape is a must for any serious Buffett fan!  I have owned this tape for many years, and I still watch it over and over again.  It was recorded in the mid-1980's, so Buffett's newer stuff is not included.  However, most  of the songs that have made Jimmy Buffett a household name are included.  The video contains one hit after another.  I especially liked &quot;One  Particular Harbor&quot;.  Buffett is awesome!  If you are a  Parrothead, YOU MUST PURCHASE THIS TAPE!	6
I am a little big fat man, am over-weight for sure, but in spite of my fat waist line, the waist band on these boxers stretch to fit and are very comfortable.  I have probably about a 46-47 inch waist x 5ft 11-1/2in tall and i can wear these (XX-Large Size) all day without any discomfort.  They are especially good in warmer/hot weather.  And i think that even if i lost some weight the waist band would probably still hold up the shorts and i would not need to buy a smaller size.	8
We really need this collar for our Bichon Frise. He barks at anyone entering our home and wouldn't stop without this collar on. He knows how loud he can woof before getting shocked. It helps- but sometimes he just can't help himself and barks while getting a big shock...Also, these collars have consistently worked wonderfully, but for a limited time- after about 6-9 months, it usually just stops working (even changing the battery doesn't help).So, we just keep buying new ones. Wish they could make these last longer!	19
This powder really does what it says, controls shine! I have relatively shiny skin, especially in my T-zone, so I have to dab it on there & it takes the shine right out. I don't have to continually re-apply, which I usually find myself doing with other shine free powders I've tried. My typical coloring is nude beige & this soft cameo matched my complexion perfectly. I will say that I am using L'Oreal Paris Magic Nude Liquid Powder Bare Skin Perfecting Makeup & they work perfectly together. I don't have to use much of either.	4
This has to be one of the funniest movies ever made. When I first seen it was a Woody Allen movie, I didn't have high expectations. I decided to sit through it anyways. And, to my surprise I actually laughed through most of the entire movie. The documentary type style was the greatest idea. If you love irony this is a great movie to see. Heck, if you love to laugh this is a great movie to see. I give this one a big stamp of approval and I don't do that for many movies	15
Very simple yet elegant design.  If your looking for a great simple EDC option that will not take up much room in your pocket and won't weigh you down, then this is a great option.  It has 1 full sized plain edge blade, and 1 smaller plain edge pen knife.Something to note is that this knife does NOT come with tweezers or toothpick.  Nor does it have a key ring attachment.  This knife is more or less something that you could carry when wearing a nice suit.  It's very streamlined and slim.	20
This is by far the best video I have ever done, especially for the fun factor.  And I have done over 50 exercise videos in my time.  If you are an intermediate exerciser this is a must have.  I can't explain how much fun  this video is.  You learn the Cha-cha, Merengue, Salsa, Samba, and the  Cumbia.  It's broken down into 2 segments that are 20 minute each.  I do  both because it is so much fun.  There is even a partner dancing segment at  the end.  Definately get this video!	15
This pad has worked well for my son. He is 3.5 years old and we are trying to potty train him through the night. It's nice not to have to wash an entire sheet and mattress pad every time he has a small accident. It has never leaked and it's been washed many times and still retains its waterproof quality. The only reason I took off one star is because it's a little stiff and he was resistant to having it on his bed at first. He got used to it and now it is working fine.	3
I was a little disappointed.  Don't know if it's a QC problem or if I just got some rejects but out of 6 pots, 1 was out of spec (315k) and 2 were almost out (289k, 205k).  1 was right on the money and the other 2 were within 10%.  They are CTL's so I'm a bit confused.  Other than that they work fine, they have the nut, washer and cap included (no knob).  I will be upgrading the caps.	16
"Great power. Long, flexible hose. Good mobility. Much less ear-splitting than my old Ridgid, but certaily not ""whisper quiet."" This machine just oozes quality from the thickness of the plastic to the fit and finish. I'm going to enjoy this for a long time!********  The more I use this the more I like it.  The hose is very long and quite flexible.  Snaps in and out of the machine easily.  Very easy to empty.  Get it and you won't regret it."	21
I was going through quite a few batteries for my cats' toys: there's a chase-the-string toy, a chase-the-mouse-tail toy, and a whoo-hoo!-chase-the-laser dot toy.  Using the rechargeable batteries works well - I have an Energizer charger and two sets of 4 AAs to rotate, so they've always got something ready to pounce on!  I'm saving money and not throwing away so many batteries, and the cats don't notice the difference!	12
I bought mine used.  When I got it in, it didn't work.  There was either something wrong with the power cable or the power input in the board.  Behringer uses a custom power supply, so I had no way of testing it.  I had to send it back for a refund.  I read other reviews that have had the same problem, so it seems to be an occasional issue.However, I've used one of these boards before.  The one I used back then was fantastic and everything I needed for small projects.	16
The camera on the Kindle Fire HD does actually work, and you can use it to take pictures, but you cannot open it without getting to it.For some reason, the Kindle is blocked from seeing things that are available on the device, but this software app allows you to go in and activate the camera so that you can use it.You can record video, stills and even a panorama view, which takes a little practice.Without this app (or one like it) I would not be able to use the camera on the Kindle.	1
Charges my phone quickly enough.  There's a convenient little clip that's hard to see in the photos, but which keeps the coiled portion together so the cable isn't flopping around all over.  It also gives a bit of peace of mind to know it's a Motorola branded charger that's less likely to overcharge/fry my phone.  One small, minor issue is that the light plug end occasionally pops out of its own volition after a warm/cold weather swing, but the blue light is bright enough so you notice when it goes out.	7
....and in listening to the words of the title cut--in light of what's occurred on the East Coast, and what's going to occur if war goes on a lil too long--very, very, very prophetic. Looks as if our present is our past is our future. Marvin's vision captured it in this great album. At first I thought that I had nothing more to say of &quot;What's Going On&quot; other than what was already said below, but I find in listening to the CD now, it takes a poignant new meaning. Ain't that what great work is supposed to do?	9
I love drying my lettuce in this Gadget, I have been saving in Paper Towels since I got it, the OXO Salad Spinner, the Large one makes salads so much easier and faster. I did not care for all the washing and cutting involved making a salad I never bought the pre-packages of mix greens, didn't care for them, so now I have no more excuses to eat salads. This Gadget is so simple to operate and it is kind of Fun, I think I'm gonna start spinning for Health again!... Check Pictures Posted, Thank You	13
This jacket fits well and more importantly, functions well.  I used it for lower temperatures and with a long sleeved wicking shirt, felt warm and comfortable. I thought it might be too noisy but I don't mind the slight sounds of my arms swishing against the body of the jacket.  It's so light and wicks well. When I take it off, after 3-5 mile runs, the inside may be moist but I'm not.  I have another rain jacket that leaves me feeling clammy after a brisk walk so I can appreciate the difference .  I love it!	8
I love OXO, and have a number of their spatulas and spoonulas.  I'd never seen this small one in stores - maybe I wasn't looking very hard.  It occurred to me that I needed one at this size - to get into smaller jars.  It works great, and I realize how much I was missing something like it in my kitchen arsenal.  It's size makes it easier to maneuver on spreading tasks, where its bigger brother isn't as nimble.  I wish it were cheaper, but the quality and utility make up for it.	13
Christ's compassion is there in a certain sense, but the love, and not the violence should be glorified here.Which term would Christ approve of more?  The glory of love or the glory of violence. I think it would be the former.Gibson should have concentrated on what Christ did to teach love in many different examples, not to let the violence go on and on and on and on and on.Three stars for effort...that's it.I still think Mel is a brilliant actor.	15
For quite a long time I believed that the CD player in my truck was broken.  Then I thought, hey, why not for just a few bucks try this cleaner and maybe it'll work.  It did!  The cleaner is extremely easy to use.  You insert the cleaner disk into your CD player and follow the directions, which are said aloud to you, and in no time the cleaning is done.  After it's done cleaning, the disk plays some nice classical music for you, too.  I ejected the cleaning disk, inserted one of my CDs and voila!  It was working again!	10
when i became pregnant i planned on using these bottles, i bought everything bottle warmer,sterilizer,breast pump, and a ton of bottles and nipples. well 2 weeks into using them i threw them out the window. my daughter had  very bad gas. when i switched bottles the gas stopped. Plus the bottles are  expensive......you  have to keep buying new  nipples there are sooo many different sizes. a waste i think, most bottles have 2 fast or slow but there seemed to be 4 different sizes or more.	3
I have been using GHS Fast fret for over six years and it's amazing stuff, I apply just a tiny amount to the strings before I play and then wipe them down afterwards, I used to change strings every one to two months and now strings can last me a year. It's easy to control home much you put on and one can of this stuff lasts me a year or two, there isn't really any reason to just soak everything with it I don't think, I mainly use it to clean the strings. I'm really glad I found this stuff!	16
I love Meguiar products - especially the quick detailer and tech wax.This product seemed to work really well on newer tires and maintained a nice glossy, black wet look for over a week of local driving.This one let me down a bit on older tires on another car though -- it goes on looking great, but after drying leaves the tires only looking a bit darker black and without any gloss.  Perhaps these older tires are more porous from wear and age, or a different composition that the product didn't respond well to.	2
Overall these are very good labels and my complaint doesn't really count since they directions say not to run the sheet of labels through the printer more then once, but I do.  With the easy peel labels the sheet tends to get stuck a little more in the printer then before, but it's not a ton.  And I reuse sheets because really, I'm not wasting a whole sheet for 2 or 3 addresses!  Besides that I've never had a problem with these labels smudging or not sticking, I've always been pleased with Avery labels.	17
My favorite character is Sephiroth.He also makes an appearance in &quot;kingdom Hearts&quot; as the toughest boss in the game.(but i beat him!)Final Fantasy VII is a brillant mind-blowing game.Cloud is the main character of this game.He also makes an appearance in &quot;Kingdom Hearts&quot; as 3 or 4 bosses,he's easy.The thing is,I couldn't even get past the mechanical scorpion!The game is just way too hard for me.But I beat it.The Sephiroth's are also Hard.If you're in for some action,buy this.Cloud is just such an amzig character,and so is Sephiroth.sincerly,kenny	23
This is a very well written book and I enjoyed the writing style of the author.  It was the storyline that didn't quite do it for me.  I tend to stay away from time travel books, because I drive myself crazy over-thinking about what's happening/going to happen/never should have happened etc.  This book was listed under romance, but it is much more of a mystery/time travel book and had very little romance in it.  I also found myself growing incredible frustrated with the main character.  Finally, just so you're prepared, don't expect a HEA.	14
This polish is easy to use and it gives excellent results. I don't use it in my car because it makes it look darker, so I use a paint cleaner and then wax, but if you don't want to spend a lot of time detailing your vehicle, go for it. It also lasts a long time -and keep in mind that it has to cure, at least, a week or so. It is normal to see some streaks at first, but they'll go away. It leaves the paint very shiny.	2
"These are the only paper targets I use at the range. No tape required as the entire thing is a huge sticker so you can just peel and paste it onto the target stand. I love that you can see where you hit as the impact point ""explordes"" a flourecant green. I dont have to use my spotting scope to see where I am hitting because of this. The smaller diamonds on the corners are 2"" and the square grids are 1"". Best target I have ever shot at."	20
I bought this for a feral cat I am taming.  She is in a room that gets a bit chilly at night.  It stays warm most of the night.  There have been times when I come back in the morning that it is cold, but also times that it is still warm.  The only thing that would make it completely perfect is if it were more flat and maybe softer.  I put blankets around and over it to make it a little more comfortable.  This is a great product!	19
Oh she adores all her pets but the beaver even it is so small the adores and tries to hide this one and bury it in her bed so no one sees it to take it away from her.  Oh this is so cute being so small (The dukies are cute too - but ); she loves the beaver even more (maybe because of the tail?  Thanks so much KONG for this one.  Again NOT FOR A LARGE DOG  (TOO SMALL)  My dog only 4lbs 5oz.	19
Everything is wrong in the disaster as all the charm, sadness and drama of this classic is gone. Charlotte should be a hairy spider with a Lucille LaVerne type voice, not a gorgeous arachnid with Miss Reynold's soothing tones. This is a story of friendship and self-sacrifice which is totally missing. And the tragic death of Charlotte, which is the highlight of the story, is simply glossed over. Along with The Cat in the Hat and The Grinch , Charlotte's Web is one of a trio of worst children's films of all time.	6
"This is a game that will stretch your pattern recognition skills. Basically, you need to remove circles in groups. They have to be in columns or rows. Each level seems to have a couple of ""keys"" that will help you get started. I didn't need more than one try for a level until I got into the 20s. I find that it is very satisfying to clear a board.The visuals are pleasing. I think that this is a game that I will enjoy playing for a few minutes here and there until I finish it."	1
Starting easy, this puzzler has you match two orbs in a line to eliminate them from the field.  Eliminating all orbs from the field completes the level.  Later levels have you matching 3-4 orbs and stars (count as 2 orbs) to clear them.  The graphics are good and the sound is decent.  Oddly enough, the story is what kept me playing through all 100 levels.  The lack of an ending to that story is the only reason I dock this game a star.	1
Such a necessity that once I received it for Christmas I got rid of the Jumper Pak for good.The Expansion pak holds MUCH more memory.If you have games that need it ask mom and dad night and day to buy you an Expansion Pak.You really have no need for the Jumper Pak.The Jumper Pak is really hard to get out anyway.I had to use a knife to get the Jumper Pak out which cant be too good for the system but what the hey now the Expansion Pak is in and I dont need to worry anymore.	23
I just got one for my 2001 Chevy Suburban and one for my 2006 Ford Five hundred. These covers fit well. They don't slide and they are made of real leather. You can smell the leather scent. One imprtant note is that as a result of these covers being made well and of a thick leather, they do make the driving experience slightly different. They do make the steering wheel thicker. No regrets, the steering wheels on my cars were in poor condition. The alternative would have been to purchace new steering wheels.	2
This works well for cleaning shrimp, as advertised.  I've cleaned 6-7 lbs of large shrimp so far and this makes it quick and easy.  I don't know why people are so fussy about the construction being plastic - it is far more resilient than a shrimp's shell and should stand up to quite a bit of use unless you abuse it.  A metal blade would probably lead to more mangled shrimp so it's just fine.  I'm quite satisfied with the item and would have no issues recommending it to anyone.	13
Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time is one of my favorite games ever!  I just love the storyline and the characters,even though Link, Ganondorf and Zelda have been in all of the Zelda games, but this game is the best.  The original Legend of Zelda for the Nintendo was okay, but it felt like the game would NEVER end!  I recommend this game to fantasy lovers who also love the idea of a super villan an action-ready hero.  This is also one of Nintendo's classics.  Everything a fantasy story needs is right in this game.	23
What can you say these are mailing labels for large envelopes or packages. They are plain white, come in sheets of ten with the usual supporting formats in office suites and online at the Avery website. The one key aspect of these labels that makes them different from the standard labels is the TrueBlock that masks any text that they are laid over, no more seeing through the label to the prior addressee.As far as I am concerned these labels fulfill all of the claims made by Avery and work splendidly. P-)	17
"This is a great guitar once you change the strings, as suggested. Great portability for the price.HOWEVER - having read reviews across multiple sites, I too am a victim of the HORRIBLE glue smell that so many others have complained about. I really liked the guitar, so I purhcased it from two separate retailers, but had to return both due to the horrific smell. I even tried contacting the manufacturer to send a ""smell-free"" case... And they sent a case. But it stunk too. It's a shame, I had to return them, because they were nice little guitars."	16
I love this nursing bra. It's super comfy and fairly supportive. But, it fits like a sports bra, giving you a &#34;uni-boob&#34;. Especially if you have a larger chest like me. However, it's perfect for wearing around the house! The one thing I don't like about this bra is the line on the side of your boob. It shows under clothes and can be annoying. As a side note, I wear a 42H while nursing and the Double Plus XL fits just fine. :)	8
My sister-in-law told us not to register for this because she couldn't get it to work.  Well, I wanted it and I registered for it anyway.  We got it and I decided to give it a try just to make sure it worked.  I used it the next time my friend came over with her newborn and it worked great.  Just add a little water, throw in the bottle, and in minutes it was perfect.  My only suggestions would be to add an on/off switch and a timer.  But other than that, it's another great product by Avent.	3
"I really like this calories counter app. I use it on my Kindle Fire. I really enjoy the convenience of use,as well as theNice,big ""calories remaining"" number so I know with a quick glance what I have for the day.It has a large database of foods to browse,or I can create ny own entries easily. Weight,and measurements can also be tracked,as well as exercise. I really like the way progress is graphed so it can be easily assessed at a glance too. Very nice, free app. Would reccomend."	1
My kid loves Elmo so I usually get Sesame street DVDs for him to watch Elmo. It was a bit disappointing that Elmo doesn't feature in this one. But he does get glued to it all the same with all the singing and dancing. In terms of educational content and approach to teaching the alphabet to kids, I think it's excellent and is quite entertaining too. The Alphabet support group idea adds a nice touch which I doubt my kid would understand now but had me laughing to bits the first time I watched it.	15
I remember this like it was yesterday.  My old worn out VHS copy is still hanging in there, but if Warner Bros. knows what's good for them (and when it comes to Prince, they obviously don't) they'll give this tape the artistic treatment it deserves.Classic moments.  Absolute classics.  &quot;I Could Never Take the Place of Your Man&quot; brings me to tears every time I see it.  They are in such a groove on that song that even a nuclear bomb blast couldn't touch them.  Simply breathtaking playing, wonderful compositions, and high level performances.	6
A lot of people didn't like Quest for Glory 5 when it was released, but I love it.  Yeah, the first time I played it, the controls were different than the previous four games, and it took some getting used to, but once I got used to it, I was in love.  It's got a nice, tie-up-the-loose-ends-happily-ever-after feeling about it.  And of course, it's got all the famous QG humor...including the bad puns and the moose head.  I have played this game I don't know how many times, especially now that you can download a patch for XP (it works great).	23
I've had a conair facial sauna for years (and it was still working fine when I lost/misplced it) so I had to try another Conair.Well, this is perfect, even better than the first one I got. Why? It's got that safety timer, it tells you when it's ready, it comes with two cones to choose from. Plus, it comes with this free exfoliating brush and sponge. So nice. I used it last night and now my skin's glowing beautifully, like it got a polishing. It's a nice way to pamper yourself.Great price too!	4
This product is simply amazing and so easy to work. I had neglected my mac keyboard at work for a while and it had accumulated quite a bit of gunk on the keys. It took just about a minute or so of cleaning with this kit. Drop the cleaning solution on to the provided sponge brush, do some circular motions on the keyboard - you'll see it getting cleaned right away. I didn't have to use the 'side' brushes, but can see how useful it would be on a windows keyboard with deeper keys.	17
My 98 toyota Sienna has 135k miles and recently got a engine check light (CEL).  The code was P0420 (catalytic converter).  A new CAT is expensive, so I gave CRC a try.  I put a bottle of CRC to the gas and followed the instruction.  I also reset the CEL using a OBD II scanner.The result:The smog numbers (CO,HC,O2) were improved by about 5 to 10% but not enough to pass the California smog check.	2
This is the best book I have read in a long time. It gives a great historical account of the early years of WWII that is completely factual, save for the fictional characters Wouk inserts. This book is a page-turner, yet still allows the reader to gain excellent information about real events and circumstances in the war. Wouk shapes his characters so fully that it makes it easy for the reader to empathize with them, yet without any unnecessary detail. I feel this book is a great compromise for people who are interested in world events yet still enjoy a riveting fictional story.	5
"This Havahart ""Critter Ridder"" is effective at repelling the animals that make a habit of frequenting my low, rock fence line, most notably squirrels, rabbits, squirrels, and the nasty little dog that the neighbor likes to let do it's ""business"" in my yard. This applies easily from the shaker bottle and seems to last about two weeks for us but we did have several very powerful rain storms come through, which will reduce the effectiveness.I am hoping that a few applications of this will condition the pests to seek other areas where they can frolic, away from my plants and not befouling my yard.Recommended!CFH"	18
This sander is great in the beginning.  It works like a well built machine, and then, it happens.  For some reason, this thing gets out of balance and ceases to do a good job.  It wobbles all over the place.  My  shop owns 6 of these that were all bought at the same time, now after one  year of daily use, 4 of them are unusable because of the  counter-balance.PROS** Can apply alot of pressure** Very  strongCONS** Gets out of balance** Brushes hard to change** 2  hand sander	21
I wear a rago 1359 obg every day. with it on I have a flat tummy again. Wearing a girdle does meanwearing panties under (Vanity Fair Nylon Rivissant) - to help put it on and stockings (Berkshire It Fits)toprevent ride up. Dressing in the morning takes a bit of time but my girdle does stays in place. At first it is tight, then comfortable, and then I forget that I have it on. I do not have that girdled look and I really dolook better with my girdle on.	8
"I got the Medela bottles because I intended on breast feeding my child. Unfortunatly I was unable to do that. But these bottles work wonderfully with formula!My daughter retains much less air with the Medela nipples and she seems to prefer the shape as well. I found that when I sterilize Gerber nipples they become ""gummy"" and ""sticky"", but the Medela brand holds up very well in our sterilizer.I think the Medela bottles stand the test of time, which ends up saving you money in the long run and my baby LOVES them!"	3
it is way to strong for my face, i had use a dime size all over my wet face and then rinse,after i look in the mirror my face was red all over.it went straight in the garbage,but what i do like is clean and clear blackhead eraser scrub,it smell really good and leaves my face super soft,so i will continue to use clean and clear blackhead eraser scrub,as for the clean and clear continuous control acne cleanser never again will i put that crap on my face.	4
This is really a book of 3 short stories about the wizard Wistril. He lives in a castle with gargoyles and a snarky apprentice. He just wants to be left alone to drink beer, eat good food and work on his research. Don't we all? But he seldom gets what he wants. These stories were wonderful, creative and very funny. Frank Tuttle is a relatively new author on the scene, but definitely one to watch out for. I greatly hope to see more of Wistril in the future!	14
MyVicks Vapor Inhalerseemed to have run out of decongestant, so I wanted to buy another one. I saw the reviews for this product on Amazon and decided to give it a try. Wow, they were not kidding, this stuff is strong! Just a couple of sniffs, and my nose was no longer blocked. It even made my eyes tear, it's that strong. I'm glad a bought a three pack, because I intend to keep one in my purse, one in the bathroom, and one by my bed. Great product.	12
"I have recommended this movie more times than I can remember since I first saw it.  As a retired school teacher, I would say it is a MUST if you want children to be motivated toward excellence AND it assuredly gives parents a much needed ""heads up"" about how much time our children are wasting on anything and everything that is not preparing them for their future success.  A true story is always the best movie for me and I am so glad I have this one in my library.  I am continually getting it out to share with someone."	15
"Had a hard time putting this one down. Started reading it Saturday. Stayed up way too late trying to finish it. Couldn't do it. Went to church the next day. Long day at church, as I'm a pastor. Finished reading it during the Super Bowl! Let me tell ya...the Super Bowl was an exciting game (didn't get resolved until the last few seconds), but this book was even better than that! I had to finish it! My only complaint is...""Where's the sequel???!"""	14
I gave a five star rating because of past expierence using this product.The first California car duster I had recieved as a gift  lasted 15 yrs.I bought a new one 5 yrs ago its still doing a good job and use that for my work truck.t I wanted to buy  one for my wife's vehicle..I like the wooden handle FYI follow instructions about putting it on a newpaper for 48 hrs.It will show some streaks the few times of use.They have to get broken in and it does a great job.I highly recommend this product.	2
TENEBRAE is a stylized thriller by the master of horror, Dario Agento. Following the American mystery writer, Peter Neal, TENEBRAE is an entertaining horror masterpiece that mixes elements of humor and romance  into its macabre plot. Released as UNSANE in the US and cut by more than 10  minutes, TENEBRAE is here in its full, uncut glory from Anchor Bay  Entertainment. I give it three thumsbs up, if that's possible. Make sure to  check out DEEP RED and INFERNO being released in March, 2000.	15
This is a great design for EDC in polite company, when you don't want to pull out a red knife!  It is amazing that a 125 year old company is still coming up with something new and really in tune with the times.A little thinner than my usual Explorer, with everything important, lacking only the magnifying glass and Phillips screwdriver.I always have to say that Victorinox is definitely THE brand of Quality for SAK's.  Their factory-original blades last longer than Wenger, and much longer than ****ty Chinese knock-offs, most of which are nearly impossible to resharpen.	20
"This is a very sturdy little item for yard work, but it is very low to the ground to be handy to sit on if you have any back problems or you carry any extra weight.  Would be nice if it was a few inches taller.  The storage compartment under the seat is kinda inaccessible, and it would be nice if the seat popped up so you could get to what you store in there.  Would also be nice to have a ""tongue"" so that you could pull it along."	18
Tenchu: Stealth assassin - CircaGOOD:- Easy and fun stealth gameplay- nice/tight controlsBAD:- Really dated graphics- Stealth gameplay can be overly simple- Little replay value with not much to unlockWILL IT FIT YOUR TASTE:- Ancient Japanese samurai and swords theme- Ninja Stealth gameplay, more fun hack and slash then overly complex (think more Metal Gear then Splinter Cell)- Two playable characters one male and one femaleGAME ITS MOST ASSOCATED TOO:- Tenchu 2: Birth of the assassin- Metal Gear Solid- Siphon FilterADDITIONAL NOTES:- Getting a better ninja rank at the end of missions unlocks much better items	23
"The enigmatic Mr. Clark was always my favorite character of the Ryan canon, and this book takes him back to his beginnings, in the 1960s. Really Clancy's only ""historical"" novel, this thriller is probably his most emotional, with a story that pulls you into a vengeful thrill ride.It's been a common ploy in thriller fiction, the highly trained soldier going after the criminals who murdered his girlfriend, but no one does it in such a visceral manner as Clancy in Without Remorse. I've read the book probably five times since it came out, and it never gets old. Highly recommended."	5
I just bought an emergency back-up generator.  It's just like a snow thrower.  It you buy it, you probably will never need it and it becomes another gas-fired device that needs maintenance.  Unfortunately, we need both.  Ocassional power outages and significant snow storms here in Maryland do happen.  Even though we hopefully will never have another 40&#34; monster storm like the one a few winters ago, we do have frequent violent storms enough to justify the generator and I just about wore out my snow thrower on that one storm alone.  I think we're do for more.  Hence the generator cover.	18
Stop using those cheap red erasers. Put down those pencil erasers down. Use this Staedtler eraser. Now!I can confirm and agree with other reviewers and countless people (who haven't reviewed this) that this eraser is indeed one of the best.The eraser has a smooth feel and consistency when erasing. It's not rough and does not destroy the surface that is being erased. For the most part, it can handle any erasing job.Immensely useful for drawers, artists, students, teachers, everyone. Anyone can benefit from this phenomenal eraser.	17
Well above average haunted house film. As emotional as it is scary.The same could be said of most of producer Guillermo Del Toro's films.The story feels a little too familiar for most of it's length to quitemake it to classic film status, although the last 10 minutes doelevate it to something more moving and more thoughtful than 95%of thegenre pictures currently being made.Wonderfully acted by Belen Rueda, as a mother whose child mysteriouslydisappears. Well shot as well.The kind of film I look forward to re-watching, sure that now that Iknow its secrets, there's even more to be uncovered.	0
When my kids got this game at 3 and 4 it was a great first board game and they still enjoy playing over a year later (...).To make it a little more educational and challenging we made new cards recently with the names of the colors written on them.  Both kids are just beginning to read so this has been a fun way to practice recognizing color words.  We made cards for some of the special squares as well so the feel of the game stays the same.  It's keeping the game interesting for all of us who get roped into playing.	22
"Slate Magazine has a review on table salts and this was the winner.  So I ordered some from Amazon and compared it myself to the brands available where I live, including Celtic Sea Salt.  There is no comparison... Maldon is the standout winner. It is big flaky, crunchy pieces of very tasty salt.  This is not a baking salt.  It is more of a finishing salt to go ""on"" foods.  It's wonderful on avocado, steamed yellow squash, baked potatoes... etc.  The Slate reviewer said he loved it the best on chocolate H&auml;agen-Dazs ice cream!  It's that good."	11
This is one of the 2 toys that have survived my puppy's teething phase. The rest are history. I have a female lab retriever, and this is the toy she prefers when her teeth hurt. She doesn't chew on it hard enough to break it, but you can tell it's losing its texture. I think it's a great toy that will last a long time =)UPDATE 3/17/2014: This is one of the few toys that has survived my lab retriever! It's losing its texture (from all the biting) but it hasnt been broken :) Very recommended!	19
Very Difficult to get it to make an even cut though!!! EVEN ON A FLAT SURFACE LINING EVERYTHING UP!!! It's like it does what it wants to when it comes to whether it makes a straight cut or one that is angled.But all-in-all it is a good Trimmer.You can even use it to cut up stuff like old credit cards, or IDs. I use it as my own little shredder on documents that have personal information on that I need to throw away. (just a tip)	17
So I actually bought this thinking it was the entire Lesson 2 kit. However, I've found through experience that having the book without having to take the class is a good thing. I've taken the Wilton Lesson 1 class and the number of Wilton items you have to purchase ALONG with the Lesson kit is a little ridiculous. I've worked my way through Lesson 1 and now I'm working my way (by myself) through lesson 2. I recommend anyone that likes to work on their own time to just purchase this book.	13
Parks and recreation season 1  while this is a very short season it does introduce the characters nicely. I do like Amy Poehler and that made me watch the whole season. This 'go-do-it' anyway character portrayed by Amy Poehler is likable. Also, somewhere in the end of Season 1 you start to love the other characters as well if you are into light comedy 'no nonsense' easy to watch show. I have since finished watching Season 2 as well which by far has been very good also.	0
Anyone who owns a Nintendo 64 and does not own Mario Kart should just throw it away.This is a classic N64 game that's a ton of funeven today where there are games with better graphics.The point of the game is simple: win the race by any means.There are no plot twists, no complicated storylines.It has all the classic Mario characters includingMario, Luigi, Peach, Bowser, Wario, Toad, Yoshi and others.Once you finish everything, there is a bonus optionwhere you can play all levels again but backwards!Seriously, this game is an awesome classicand a great addition to any and all N64 game collections.Overall,5/5	23
My kids love this toy, even my 12 year old crams himself into this car. If thats not durablity I don't know what is. This car has lasted threw 4 children the oldest 12 & now still getting use by my 3 & 1 year old. It has very little fading with tons of hours out side. We are also a military family so we move every couple of years & it is still in great shape after 4 moves. I would definitly recomend this car & most little tikes out door products.	22
My wife wanted a good, stiff, vegetable brush.She laughed, and laughed, when she got this in the mail for a Christmas present. She says she could have gotten it at the local grocery store.But she loves it. One of the best stocking stuffers ever.(My wife is very, very difficult to please when it comes to kitchen gadgets --- actually she's hard to please in all respects, but that's a different story -- so, I was relieved to hear her say she loved this brush.)	13
A great product. When I used it didn`t know what to really expect because of some mixed reviews but I noticed a change inmediatly the engine made less noise and had a bit more power. Even my girlfriend felt the car running better (without knowing that I had done anything to the car). I would recommend to any body who feels there car isn`t as peppy as before its really worth trying, just use as recommended. Even do I only used it via brake booster and gas tank didn`t use it in the crankcase. Still great!!!	2
One Spots come with an 8-pedal multi plug. If you only have 4 pedals, or lets say you have 12, powering them with an 8 plug makes it difficult to isolate power and noise levels properly. The left over connectors can cause ground issues if they touch things when they aren't plugged into pedals. Using this smaller multi plug will leave less open spaces, alternatively it can be attached to any link in another multiplug to add more plugs. Very nice quality, just as with all one spot stuff. Great price, great purchase.	16
This is your basic British kidnapping gone awry with expected twists. (OH THOSE BRITS!) The entire cast consisted of three people and a guy at the other end of a phone. Two bad guys go to great efforts to kidnap a young woman and not get caught. Their plan is well thought out. They seem like professionals until the human factor enters into the equation and Gemma doesn't play by the rules. Good crime thriller, well written and acted.PARENTAL GUIDE: F-bombs, nudity (Gemma Arterton) plus some male nudity. Sexual themes.	0
"I was looking for a financially good deal. The price was so reasonable, I said, ""How can something this cheap be that good"",..well they were a great investment. I use them all the time and have had people ask me where I purchased such a great sounding cadiod microphone. When I told them the price, they thought I was pulling there leg,..I wasn't. The case is plastic, foam and clips. Three good clips would cost you ten dollars alone, now compare for yourself. I'd buy these again in a heart beat. I just might buy another 3-pack!!"	16
At least 1 out of 2 dogs enjoys it periodically.  It definitely doesn't get chewed down.  The material is very, very hard and I had my doubts about it and the dogs teeth,.  However both walmart and petsmart carry tons of nylabone stuff so I figured iT HAd to be alright or there would have been recalls.  Me I don't like it, but the dog does and since she doesn't chew on it obsessively, unlike other things I'm not too worried about her teeth.	19
we bought this charging cord because the t505 only came with a car charger.  we now have 2 t505 with the 2nd one intended for use with connecting our bluetooth enabled phones with the home stereo.  this cord offers a convenient way to charge both as we are not in the car for long enough periods for the device to charge completely while travelling.  by bringing in the devices we are able to charge overnight to a full charge.  great price and no complaints with receipt of material in either packaging or transit time.	7
"It's amazing how many wonderful things can go on a simple piece of bread.  Peanut butter, hazlenut butter, almond butter...  Then don't forget the wonderful Marmite, a yeast extract.  Sigh...  But Marmite, Marmite is for eating toast while reading ""Moby [...]"", or perhaps ""Barnaby Rudge"". A bit hearty.  Nutella is for eating toast while reading ""Remebrance Of Things Past"" or ""Dracula"".  Rather luscious.  Like Marmite, Nutella goes a lot farther than the prescribed serving size.  Spread thinly.  Now, my children, go out and turn your whole wheat toast into a chocolate doughnut.  Marcel Proust would want you to."	11
While trigger locks are not intended to make a gun safe (you can still place a round in the chanber of most firearms), They can act and serve as a deterrent to the use of the firearm.  The lock easily attaches to the trigger guard of all firearms.  It is only effective on firearms with fixed trigger guards. I prefer a combination lock because it eliminates the need for keeping a keyring with multiple keys.  I keep and store each of my firearms with one of these combination locks.	20
Langley never fails to deliver. I love a good shifter tale and this one definitely pleases. Dev is a reluctant hero, rising to the occasion to save his mate, Lainey, from an abusive alpha. Lainey is a spunky, cute, klutz who keeps his handsome mate, and the reader, laughing and groaning in turns at his antics. This fast-paced, sensual story kept me turning pages to find out what happened next. This one has a permanent place on my reader, because once wasn't enough.	14
"I have very dry, thick, coarse, curly hair. Was skeptical about this product because of the cheap price, but I had used Aussie products years ago, and thought I'd try it. LOVED IT!Pros:Nice Scent. Light, and freshLeaves my hair shiny and softDe-tanglesInexpensivePrevents the ""frizzies""Not heavy, greasy, or waxyRefreshes my curlsAs a side note, I use this product first, after towel drying. I then also use a conditioning balm, and sometimes a bit of gel. I find that I can ""refresh"" my curls the second day after shampooing with this product and it looks great. No bed head!"	4
I find my spelling has gotten worse throughout the years and I always want a dictionary available. (I like to think this is a result of a dependence on spellcheck, rather than age!) As a former English teacher, I love being able to check the spelling or find that perfect word in my posts, saving myself the embarrassment of getting caught slaughtering our language online. I find myself using my Kindle more for posting, now that I have the convenience of Dictionary.com with me on this devise as well as on my computer.	1
Listening to this album, it's very difficult to realise that she is only 18. She plays the fiddle with a skill way beyond her years, and her delicate soprano voice sings of lost love and heartbreak with such emotion and beauty that touches the heart of anyone who has experienced love gone wrong. This album was just a hint of what was to come, and I had the pleasure of seeing her in concert a few years back, in Toronto. This is Bluegrass at its best. Buy it, you'll love it.	9
the people who rated this highly only used it for Tivo...I have vonage and i wanted this to put my telephone in a place different than where my vonage router is in my apartment and it works HORRIBLY.i spent over an hour trying multiple different connections and distances and came to the conclution that the only way it works is if they receiver is in the same jack as the sending device.  SO DISAPPOINTED!!!i got it for $35 so im not that mad, but still i paid for something i should not have bought in the first place..	10
I am using this device on my Samsung Fascinate:I liked my first one so much, I ordered two more. One for each car, and one to carry with me (I'm a professional driver, and use lots of different vehicles).Fortunately, the micro-USB interface is becoming quite common, so this also charges my wifes phone, and my bluetooth headset.As a bonus, it clearly lights up to let you know when it is getting power.  This is very handy, since not all vehicles give power when the vehicle is turned off.	7
Works great.  I didn't use the monster size wall board screw and it holds fine with the small furnished screws.  Next time I'm buying the all metal one and daisy chaining them to a board so I don't have to make tons of holes in the wall for my half dozen guitars.  For now I'm hanging one on the wall with this and it's fine.  Wood is nice quality.  I notice the price is almost 2x as much if you walk in the guitar center.	16
This is a basic sound card.  Nothing fancy.  The thing that seperates it from the rest is that Creative is a huge company and has drivers available for all Windows (the Linux/BSD world probably supports this thing, I haven't checked).  This is as close to plug and play as you can get.That guy who ranted about this card crashing his system needs to buy a clue and check his IRQs, not to mention dump Windows ME (which *Microsoft* doesn't even stand by).	10
The ducks sing a little quack song when you pull the string, which is just as amazing for my four year old as it is for the 16 month old.Sure, it turns over, but they pull it anyway.... just dragging the poor little duckies down the hall on their sides....Only problem, it never fails that the string gets pulled at the most inconvenient moments - like when everyone's finally asleep and you're trying to put just one more toy in the box.It's a cute little toy - simple and fun.	22
These do, in fact, perform as advertised.  They run through my laser printer cleanly and adhere well, blocking things underneath (I tested it on a white box that had black sharpie on it; the sharpie was obscured by the label 100%).  They are a bit small for my box-shipping needs (I use the half-sheet labels for that) but for mailing correspondence to the same address every month, it's quite easy to run off the addresses on a sheet of these labels and keep them with my stamps.	17
I saw a TV commercial for this. I thought it wouldn't work so I got it from Walmart so I could easily take it back if it didn't.  IT WORKED.  Now I'm getting it from Amazon after this bottle runs out.It's not that it hides odor any better, it's that it stops wetness better.It's no secret about the aluminum ingredients.  The only thing keeping the mainstream deodorant makers form using the same ingredients is controversy over the effects of aluminum absorption into the system.	12
Before getting this, I experienced a kick-back with a 2.5&#34; x 2.5&#34; x 10&#34; block of wood that knocked the wind out of me.  If these had been on my saw that would not have happened.  Between these and the Gripper hand feeder I feel a lot safer with my table saw.  I highly recommend these!  But read the instructions....  using these incorrectly (like not having the rollers on the correct side on small stuff) can make them more dangerous.  So again, these provide excellent safety _when setup and used correctly_.	21
This book was awesome!  I really couldn't put it down...one of those books where I try to get somewhere early just so I have time to read while I wait.  I bought it because I saw that the movie was coming out...and I always like to read a book before the movie.  I was NOT disappointed and now am anxiously awaiting the movie release.  I loved it how it went back and forth between Jacob's time in the circus and his life at age 94.  A wonderful love story...but it was much more than that! I highly recommend!	5
I've played this game many, many times. But unfortunately, it's one of those games that you will either love or hate, which you can tell by the reviews here and I love it.This game is pretty lengthly, gives you a choice of things to say in response to questions and is overall fun, especially since you get to play the entire movie. I recommend this game to die hard fans, but like I said, don't be surprised if for some reason you don't like it. Some do, some don't. Simple as that	23
My cats love this food...and the price is right.( usually a bit cheaper than any store) If you'll read the ingredients, the FIRST ingredient is not chicken meal or some by product, it's real chicken!! The cats love it, and it's very nutritious. We took this bag to our Veterinarian and showed him what our cats were eating...he was pleased and said go ahead and feed them this..and he had tons of food in his office he could've tried to sell us for our one cat's sensitive tummy.  He said this food is great!!  We won't feed them anything else!	19
i have my doubts as to whether these things do any good or not. never once have i had one clear up a burn problem. there is no substitute for opening the cabinet and blowing it out w/ something like a Datavac (see product on Amazon; it replaces all those cans of compressed air. one of the best investments i've ever made. i blow the dust of discs BEFORE i put them in the player. that's how most dust get's in them, on the discs!), and cleaning the lens w/ a foam tipped swab and pure alcohol.	10
I felt the first season was very dark and all the characters only seemed interested in thier own interest they didn't really care about the rest of the crew only whats in it for them.  The only real exception to that was the kid that solved the game he pretty much started out as a generally good guy that was always trying to look out for everyone's interest; I liked the final season much better as they started to turn this idea around and made everyone more concerned with the group and less concerned with themselfs.	0
Made Communist ChinaThis tool is probably okay for the do-it-yourselfer. However, if you are earning a living with your tools stick with American or German or Japanese manufactured tools.I found that the side grip requires the use of the extension bar. In simple low torque drilling applications the side handle cannot be used without the extension. this makes drilling in close quarters more difficult.Milwaukee once had a great reputation for American-made quality. Unfortunately they have gone the cheap route, and have succeeded.	21
No matter how many power tools you have in your builder's or cabinetmaker's kit, you need a block plane, and the Stanley delivers 90% of the performance of the high-end tools at a fifth of the cost. I've used mine for heavy duty work, like triming new window casings flush with walls, as well as for delicate trimming in repairing musical instruments.The bases of the Stanley tools may not be as perfectly flat as those of the expensive Lie Nelsons, but that's easily rectified in short order with some sandpaper and a sheet of glass. A fine tool at an excellent price.	21
"Do NOT buy these batteries and this little 'handy kit' if you want a battery you can RELY on.  My experience using them in flashlights (Fenix, Sure Fire, etc) has been dismal.  Full charge = one hour of 'strobe'.  Contacted vendor and was told that ""these cells vary"" and that ""replacing them wouldn't help"".....so WHAT WOULD HELP?!?!Basically, the vendor says that these cells are worthless and unreliable.  Is that what you're looking for?  Go elsewhere.  The battery sucks and the vendor sucks."	10
I have been trying lots of these facial products that are sold at CVS/Walmart type stores. So far, Olay and Aveeno are the only brands that consistently work. The effects of this serum are very subtle, but they ARE noticeable. It tends to just soften the look of your skin over all, and while it doesnt affect deep wrinkles, it does help minimize smaller ones. I also have skin that is very prone to break outs, and this has amazingly never caused any! Over all, for me it is definitely worth the money.	4
I bought several of these and installed them in the rooms at our bed and breakfast. As I don't wear make up it never occurred to me that women would like to see their pores expanded to such an alarming size. In any case, the mirror has two sides, one with a normal reflection and one 5X. It is easy to flip from side to side. I wall-mounted them in a matter of minutes and they telescope out and tilt so people of varying heights can easily adjust them. Nice, clean design and good for the purpose they serve.	4
Okay, Woodstock is supposed to be about peace love and unity. This video proves &quot;peace love and unity&quot; as &quot;hate gangs and destroying&quot;. They should have had some more positive bands like 311.  I.C.P. should NOT have been there!  They REALLY made me mad when they sang  &quot;F**k The World&quot;. Other than that, the video was okay. They could  have put some better songs from the bands though. Especially from Godsmack,  Lit, and Metallica. Basically, the video was not bad.	6
I am not a professional gun person - I am rather new to the hobby and enjoy shooting!  But when it comes to cleaning my guns I have tried a few different tools and have mostly been disappointed.  Until now.  This is so easy to use, durable, cleans well and is just about perfect in my mind.  So very glad I made this investment!!!  I purchased different sizes for the different guns I have.  They are easy to store and easy to use.  Highly recommended.	20
Drank some as soon as I got it. Unfortunately, the flavor is so un-memorable, that I haven't thought of it much since! I do like that I could mix it with any other tea flavor, however, because I do believe that it has beneficial properties. It was sealed in a back in the box, and while that bag is not resealable, I expect that as long as I remember to, I will drink it up before it goes stale. Not sure I'd notice the flavor difference, honestly.	11
Over at Bobistheoilguy, K&N is one of the top rated oil filters. Now granted they're not the best, but they're a good compromise and they're FAR better in flow rate and filtration than Fram or any of the other cheap junk. If you want the best of the best, You're going to have to go with Royal Purple or PureOne, or Puralator. Even motorcraft ranks high. However this filter filters well, and flows oil well. Its not state of the art, but it still certainly does its job very well. Much better than those below it.	2
I sit in my deer blind from dark to dark and texting my buddies and playing games on the cell phone helps alleviate the bordom.  Bad thing is, the cell goes dead before dark.  I carted a 12 volt ar battery to my blind, hooked the Roadpro to it and now my cell battery never goes dead.  Plus, the car battery will keep you charged for a long long time.  I don't keep the phone plugged in, only when it starts going dead I charge it enough to get me by and then charge it at camp for the night.	2
KND is a great way for authors to connect with Kindle readers as well as finding new and creative writers who aren't easy to find anymore.  Unless your last name is Patterson or Grisham NY publishers aren't spending money to promote your work, so this is a solid way to discover new talent.Besides, one of the nice features of a Kindle is the ability to sample a writers works and KND offers a deeper sampling as well.I've found two authors I never heard of with this blog and reading a solid book for $2.99 is one of the great attractions to the digital world.	14
This stays on my Powermatic 66 for about 95% of the time.  It does everything well.  It is not the perfect rip blade or perfect cross cut blade and certainly not the perfect plywood blade BUT I strongly believe it to be - BY FAR - the best all around blade I have ever used.  It does all of those tasks better than some other brands' job specific blades.  This baby is a workhorse and my advice is to buy iy - don't even think twice about the price.	21
"For years I used to send away for return labels and then I found out how easy it is to make my own and I'll never send away again.You go to the website listed on the box and get the free templates there and make perfect labels. There are several new designs available for both PC & Mac and they're a breeze to make.There are 3000 labels in the box and the price is incredible.  I'll be set with labels for decades.These new ones now Pop-Up when you bend the sheet making them the easiest to peel off for use,THEY""RE GREAT!"	17
"Got this for my hubby who is a total music fan.  He is enjoying this project for it has all the favorites we've come to know and love.  There's nothing like their sound (horns, drums,etc).  Their music is happy and puts you in ""feel good groovin' mood"".We both are enjoying listening to it. Received it during the timeframe indicated with no damage done to it during transport.  Enjoyed purchasing with Amazon for it is truly hassle free.  Will continue to do business with Amazon in the future.Thanks"	9
Stylistically, Tenebre is an interesting movie to watch, as are all of Dario Argento's films. As a story, there are some plot holes and some questions in the narrative. The acting isn't bad, but we aren't talk great here. The score is haunting, but seems to fall short often. The movie is great visually, but I don't think it stands up to other Argento films. This is not the Argento movie to start with. But if you are a big enough fan, then maybe you should buy it.	15
It's a nostalgic game, but I remember the construction was better quality or maybe it's just that I was a kid back then.  The light buzzard and sound effect are pretty shabby (could be so much better).Great game to play once or twice, but there it is sitting in my game closet untouched. No further requests have been made to play it.  It's either too difficult for the little ones, who become frustrated when their out after their first try or it becomes boring when the challenge is not taken seriously by the older players who give up.	22
I'm a great Woody Allen's fan but I believe he offer us three types of movies. 1. Kind of serious movies 2. Nice comedies with great dialogues and history 3. Hilarious comedies. The last type are my type. If you've seen one of the following listed below, you MUST see the others: Love and Death, Bananas, Take the Money and Run, Everything You Always Wanted to Know About Sex But Were Afraid to Ask, Anie Hall, Sleeper, A Midsummer Night's Comedy and Zelig. Garanteed laughs !	15
"This book has it all: time tunnel to the future, a super terrific submarine, working lasers, computer links in your minds, Mars station finding an alien artifact,, Love, and lives being prolonged. Of course there's always the other side of the coin. Future human who wants to be ""The Ruler Of It All"", angry scientist, murder, plots to kill, nuclear winter, changed Pacific coastline and Love lost. Great plot, good timeline between Earth before and after the time ""event""."	14
Great music, great dancing, great story -- in short, sensational. Riverdance is STILL in a worldwide tour, years after Michael Flatley left. The hypnotic dancing moves, the romantic sweep and the Celtic rhythms are truly mesmerizing. In the past couple of years it has become hip to slam Riverdance, but that is only because of its stratospheric popularity. Riverdance is exhilarating entertainment that lifts you up and leaves you with simple joy in life itself.I can't think of anything we need more given the events of the past month.Peace.	6
I wasn't surprised when I tried the 2.0.  Very effective polish for novice to enthusiast just as how it was with their original ScratchX.For those that aren't getting good results, you are probably not using the product correctly, or your scratch is just too deep.I like that there is no shaking needed.  I just grab the bottle, pour a dab onto my pad, and immediately use.Also the worked in polish easily wipes off the panel.I am very happy with the results.I consider myself a weekend car enthusiast, use professional equipment to detail my cars.	2
Excited about this based on good reviews, but did not have the same experience.Tested on my Nexus S cell phone, person on the other end complained about static and poor quality sound.  I unplugged headset and switched to using my cell, and they said the problem went away, so unfortunately problem seems to be with this headset.Also, just FYI, this does not come retail packaged, but shows up in a plastic bag with no instructions.  Not a problem for me, but makes me wonder where these are from and the quality.	7
I really don't have a lot of time. That is why I shop online, So if I'm purchasing an item that is to be used to make life more convenient, like a Bluetooth headset, it really is obnoxious to receive one that is &#34;worse than sucks&#34;. This item did not even charge. Plantronics really needs to pull this item because it is really damaging to their reputation to have this out there for sale. I choose Plantronics because as a Regional Sales Manager/Road Warrior, I've always had luck with Plantronics. Too bad that this one was a lemon.	7
This blender replaced a Sunbeam I had for 30 years.  The jar is oversized and supported by small blades placed in a small opening at the base of vessel, isolated from the mass inside. It takes forever to blend anything smooth.  After operating the motor for more than a few moments it begins to emit a strong burning smell.  The plastic drive assembly for the blades snapped off in the first week of use.  Cuisinart replaced one free.  The second one cost about twenty dollars.  I would not recommend this blender, there are better choices.	13
This was the perfect solution for my pump parts and bottles. I read everywhere that you do not need to buy a sterilizer if you have a dishwasher, but I don't run my dishwasher fast enough to have my parts and bottles ready for each feeding/pump.  This fits all of my pump parts and 2-3 bottles and nipples.  It's ready in 4 minutes, which is way faster than dealing with the dishwasher.  You do need to prewash in soapy water, but I don't worry about scrubbing.  Overall, it does the job in a very short amount of time!	3
I originally got this for my daughter's leapfrog leap pad. She was going through batteries every couple of days, so rather than go broke buying batteries, I got these along with theEnergizer Value Charger with AA Rechargeable Batteries, 4 Batteries Included, which gives us a set to put in her leap pad, and a set to keep on the charger charged.  It charges well, and is always ready when I need to swap them out. It is definite woth the money, especially if you go through a lot of batteries.	12
We get mice every winter. We've tried plugging holes, sticking around peppermint and mothballs, and we have mice. We bought these traps, put peanut butter on them. The mice ate the peanut butter, the traps did not spring. They are total junk and we went back to Victor. There was a reason these were the only ones left on the store shelf when went to buy them.Jim said the problem is when it's set the platform is high and it seems that a mouse would have problems setting it off, the trigger is not sensitive.	18
Years ago I used the Clayton &#34;small teardrop&#34; picks. I couldn't tell from the picture, that these were full size, and I didn't check the size in the description.  I still had a few of the small ones, so I used them as templates, to cut these down. I would have rated them higher, if I could have used them as is. It's my own fault for not looking at the specifications. I purchased two six packs of Clayton Teardrop picks, but found Dunlop 423R60 0.60mm (Orange) Tortex Small Tear Drop Guitar Picks, 36-Pack which are a lot cheaper.	16
I will have to review this product at the end of the summer to give a better idea of the help/quality of the product.  My first impressions were that this was a small amount of stuff.  I also think that it stinks.  I am going to use it in a compost bin, rather than the recommended ground idea.  I don't like to leave compost on the ground, as it attracts rodents.  So far my stuff has been in there for three weeks.  Will update again later.	18
Well worth it for people who like interesting rock music. A grower, it might take a few listens. Bruford left Yes to join crimson, it seems like a good move because he can show his talents more. Apparently this album was a bit of a nightmare to record. Larks part 2 rocks hard and the tune was used in a film.  There's lots of interesting pecussion tricks and good bass playing. Robert Fripp steals the show with his Easy Money guitar showcase. Some nice ballads and long instrumentals too. Worth getting. thank you	6
"Bob Marley and the Wailers / at the Rainbow (2 DVD set): This is a Great DVD of Bob Marley in concert and here you can see just how powerful and charismatic a personality he was.  All the songs here are great and are a kind of `greatest hits' package all on its own.  The second DVD has the ""Caribbean Nights"" documentary about Marley and it is very good but probably won't be played more than a couple of times.  This concert, this DVD, earns a solid Five Star rating."	6
"I must completely disagree with any disgruntled reviewers of this wonderful dvd performance of ""La Traviata"" starring the beautiful & talented Anna Moffo. The print and sound quality are excellent. So what if they are lip-synching! Many of us including myself were not even born yet when Moffo was in  her prime and were unable to see her live performances. This is a terrific memento of the greatest American born soprano in her heyday. The acting and cast are all outstanding. 5 stars for Ms. Moffo's portrayal of Violetta. Pick it up and see for yourself.Brava La Moffo!"	6
My dog is around 6 pounds, and he does not really pay much attention to this toy. I really only bought it for him because his name is Rex and I thought it would be funny. (They did not send a T-rex, just a warning -- they send you a random one!) I knew they were gonna send a random one but I had hoped for a T-Rex. That is not why I give it an okay rating though. My dog just does not seem to care for it, but maybe a larger dog would!	19
I think I paid something like twenty-three dollars for these blades the last time I got them at Walmart. They seemed to be a hot item as they kept them locked up or behind a counter for a while. The sting from the price was worse than any cut I've ever gotten from them. The blades offered here are currently about $6.00 cheaper. The exact same packaging but made in Germany (which seemed to be a plus in my mind) to be sold in Oceania. Came quickly (within a week.) No complaints.	12
I VIEW TECHNOLOGY WITH A JAUNDICED EYE. ON THE ONE HAND, WHAT CAN BE MADE AVAILABLE AT THE TOUCH OF A FINGER IS AMAZING. THIS APP PROVIDES JUST WHAT I NEED WHEN I NEED IT. HOWEVER, I HAVE LEARNED TO KEEP MY WANTS AND NEEDS SEPARATED AND HAVE BEEN SUCCESSFUL IN NOT BECOMING A JUNK JUNKIE. CONTROLLING THE LUSTS OF THE FLESH REQUIRES WISDOM AND COMMON SENSE. IF YOU HAVE BOTH OF THESE, THIS APP WORKS WELL... IF YOU HAVE NEITHER, AND YOUR CREDIT CARD DEBT IS BEYOND REASON, PAY YOUR BILLS, THEN GET THE APP.	1
This is one tool she uses to make all her traditional foods that involve dough.  She said the weight of this is just right since she has used this kind of scraper in other people's homes. She would always said oh it's not like the one I have. She loves the shape of the handle. It gives her a good grip with staining her hand.  She's been using this for years and still continues using this. Would buy her a new one if this one ever decides to break.	13
This is a great show that just keeps getting better and better.  The writing is very clever and characters are a riot.  I can't get enough of this show, and get a laugh out of it every time I see it, even the reruns.  One of the most original and funny shows to come around in a long long time.I'm happy to see this out on DVD and hope the show continues.  If you haven't seen the show watch a few episodes.  I think you'll  like it.	0
I wanted a pair of low-cut Cons All-Stars for just hanging out, and as a reminder of the ones I wore as a kid.  But for sure I didn't want to spend a hundred bucks!  These are great.  Fit is good, quality good, and they came with an extra pair of shoelaces!  No arch support at all,  but you need to know that before you buy, so you won't be disappointed.  I put in a pair of my Dr. Schols inserts and I'm a happy camper, lol.  Have been wearing them constantly since they arrived.	8
Barley Malt powder is super healthy, since the sugars are largely Maltose, which do not produce a sharp sugar spike for diabetics.  I have tried just about every one available, and Barry Farms makes the best one of all.  The Barry Farms barley malt powder is sweeter tasting than most others and quick dissolving in milk.  I use it with straight cocoa powder and milk in a blender to make a tasty chocolate malted breakfast drink.  Two tablespoons of this only has 3 grams of sugar.  This is one great tasting health food.	11
As reported for the Energizers I purchased at Amazon, I found these Duracell batteries at an online pharmacy called hocks which had them much cheaper and with my other items had no shipping or tax either. If you have only an order for a battery and will get stuck with shipping, then these prices might be OK, but if you order anything else over some limit ($75??), then the hocks place will ship free and if I remember right it was $1.69 for TWO of these batteries in one package! Can't beat that price.	12
When I first installed one of these on my new Jawbone II, they were fantastic.  They fit my ear canal perfectly, negating the need for the ear loop that came with it.  Unfotunately after a few days they started rejecting my headset.  The ear pieces would not stay on the Jawbone, and they would no longer stay firmly in my ear.  I tried washing and drying them thoroughly, but that only helped for an hour or so.  I am not sure what the fit problem is, but they turned out to not work for my Jawbone II and me at all.	7
Warning to all ladies who'll read this book: you'll fall in love with Brody.  He's sensitive, not a jerk like so many harlequin leading men, and still curls your toes.  This book was so much more than what I expected, I was incredibly surprised.  There was intrigue, family drama, humour, and lots of depth in the development of the characters in book.  There were no clear good and bad guys, just shades of grey that make the book really interesting.  Great Read!	14
I've almost lost count as to how many of these I've purchased already -- I normally keep two in each car to not only charge, my HTC Sensation, but my work Blackberry as well. I've purchased more to make sure I can plug them into rental cars (as I'm prone to forget things here and there) and keep my devices charged.It's a simple adapter, with a glowing blue end - and does everything it has to!Make sure it's purchased from Amazon - too many other reviewers also complain about getting a knock-off product!	7
It gets 5 stars just for the no vinegar part..I like tabasco but I do not love any hot sauce loaded with distilled vinegar, this is fabulous because I get to really taste habanero and no vinegar. I love habaneros they might not be the worlds hottest chili but oh the flavor, If you add this to some roasted salsa (put habs in that for sure) but add some of this if you didn't have any and it would be great. My only gripe is coloring added I know its food coloring but still it didn't really need it.	11
I understand that this is an original, but there are some things I didn't quite like with this game. In the Unknown Dungeon, I climbed a set of stairs and then ended up in a wall! I couldn't move anywhere except for out of it and back to the previous level. Eventually I managed to get up without being forced into the wall. Also, most of the game is Blue if played on the Game Boy Color or Advance systems. Gameplay, music, and the story are all extraordinarily great for a Game Boy title.	23
This game gives young children who are beginning to learn about their numbers and counting a great way to encourage and gain results. The colors are inviting, the pieces are just right for their little hands, and the rules are easy to learn and understand.  My grand-daughter loved it right away and we played until nannie was too tired to continue!  She was even starting to experiment with counting backwards when taking off her cherries - I have to take 3 off the tree? Three, two, one....Done!  Great game!	22
I finally made the plunge and got a drawer organizer for our bathroom drawer.  My husband and I have a single drawer in our bathroom so it's always quite messy filled with toothpaste, hairbrushes, hair ties, floss, bandaids, and more.This Drawer Organizer does the trick! There is a good variety of compartments that fit all of our items perfectly and I LOVE how deep this organizer is. One of the small compartments holds all of my bobbypins and hair ties perfectly. The longer organizer holds my hairbrush and combs while the middle organizer we keep for toothpaste.	17
I needed to buy cassettes elsewhere than where I was buying them from.  They were getting more expensive each and every year.  Luckily I thought about looking here.  I found cassettes at a price from a period of many years ago.  It literally brought back childhood memories, well not really, but it was very inexpensive.  I still like recording on my old cassette player but found many stores not carrying cassettes on their shelves.  And when they did, the prices were high.  I highly recommend purchasing cassettes here on Amazon, they have many different brands to chose from.	10
This did work for me, but it took a few treatments and about 1/2 the bottle. We had a lot of rain around that time and that may have been the reason it took so many treatments to work. I had used other stuff, but within a week the ants would be back. This took about two weeks of continual treatments, but the ants are now gone from around my sidewalk. I can't say it killed them off, maybe they just relocated? But, they have been gone for almost two months and I credit this product for it.	18
"Super smooth cuts.  But you can't really chop cut with the blade.  You have to take a few extra miliseconds than you would with a 60 tooth, but you make that up in sanding and/or gluing time since the cut is now at about a 150-grit finish anyway.  It seems to run quieter than the blade I replaced (can't recall the brand or model since its been on so long).  And it fits snuggly on my 5/8"" arbor, no play.  All-in-all I find it an excellent blade for my second most important saw (my table saw has a Woodworker II)."	21
I just needed an extension cable for my Sony headphones that had very short wire length (they connect to my cell phone's hands free cable and that's why they have been made that way), but most of the extensions available are at least 3ft in length. This Koss VC20 was perfect and I also got the added convenience of a volume control. However, at $8.99 (what I paid at the time) they are pricey for what they do. These days you can pretty much buy a cassette/CD walkman for that price!Nevertheless, I am happy with my purchase.	10
Taken from three distinct recording sessions - with bassist Percy Heath being the only consistent sideman - the album was released in 1954.Featuring musicians like Kenny Clarke (d), Art Blakey (d), Horace Silver (p) and Charles Mingus (p), the material is from May 19, 1953; March 15, 1954 and April 3, 1954. The eight tracks clock in at 30:05, with Miles Ahead and the title track edging away from the tight pack of quality music.The playing may not be fast and furious, but the sound is smooth as Miles is churning out cool grooves.	9
Was unsure when I purchased the DVD what to expect.  With real joy I can say that it was worth every cent and I have already watched it several times.  The Storyline kept me interested and I loved the two main actors. (Gilmore Girls, the mother) one of my favourite series.  Anway If you are unsure then try it I think most people will be very pleased, I was.  With the extras along comes a commentary and I am watching it now and it sounds like they had a great time filming this movie.  Enjoy.	0
My anxiety had gone through the roof and I decided to check these out since I did not respond well to 5htp (tip: supplements that mess with your serotonin are not the best for certain types of depression). These are wonderful and contain inositol, a supplement that has been proven to help with severe anxiety. These are also capsules instead of tablets, which are always more expensive but I find are more effective. If you suffer from anxiety or depression, it is worth it to add these to your routine. I feel much better and calmer.	12
I walk for exercise, and this app tracks my route, distance, and time. It will continue to run and give me updates on how I'm doing while I listen to Pandora on my cell phone or pause to take photos of the flowers, trees, and butterflies. At the end of my walk, it tells me how far I've walked, what my route was, how long it took me, and how many calories I've burned. It doesn't nag, and it tells me &#34;Well done.&#34; I love it.	1
Culmination and unfortunately the last season.  Great ending.  Threw in some curve balls.  Significantly more action compared to the last 4 seasons.  Mikey dies, Ronan dies, but comes back.  McKay hooks up.  Teyla's baby grows.  Todd is in alot more episodes.  This does complete the series.  Still doesn't answer alot of questions, but the stories were never dull or boring.  There were so many different avenues, just like SG-1 could have taken, but in the end. . .one of the better closing finales.	0
My intention was to have a minimal first aid kit for the car.  This little pack is reasonably well constructed, small, and even has belt loops (that I'll never use, but a great thought).  It's not going to handle major trauma, but for the occassional bandage, insect sting, wound cleaning, or field dressing, it's what you need.  There's enough extra room in the case to add two or three more items to personalize the assortment.  The contents are packaged in 3 mini zip-lock baggies, and there are common refills available for it all.	2
He is simply the best performer I've ever seen and this final episode of his TV series shows his greatness and versatility: his musical range (up-tempos, r&b, rock, ballads, folk, country,...), mastery of multiple instruments including piano, guitar and harmonica; considerable skills as an impressionist and comic; astounding physical grace and dancing ability (in spite of a fatally damaged heart), and his repoire with the audience.  He got a standing ovation from the audience; you'll see why.	6
I am beyond frustrated.  Three times the game has completely disappeared in the middle of play.  When I open it again,  the game has started over.Then,  my last game I got to level ten on normal mode and out of nowhere the game to my touch.  I helplessly watched as I went from 20 hp to death.  What a waste.  Great concept,  game breaking bugs.  It wouldn't  be fair if I didn't write the developer to try and solve this,  so I will,  and we will see if my rating changes.	1
"I don't believe there is such a thing as a perfect capo, but this one is quite good.  For those with reasonably strong hands it is pretty easy to use.  It does a very good job of compressing the strings to the frets and is definitely well built.  It is as with all capos,  important to take it off when not in use so the ""rubber"" does not get grooved.  This is just good common sense.  If this lasts a couple of years I will definitely purchase another."	16
I love Nylabone products!  Great for chewers.  My Golden doesn't chew very often, but when he does he really enjoys this one.  It's softer - which is great for their breed because they don't tend to be rough with anything.  This particular bone is good for moderate chewers.  Therefore, if you have a powerful chewer, don't get it!  The reason being - it's too soft & it will be destroyed within minutes.  The more powerful chewers (such as my Beagle), have even been able to break the bone in half.	19
This sterilizer is absolutely wonderful, especially if you take your baby on the road, i.e. to the grandparents' house.  If they've got a microwave, then you're ready to go.It's also very durable.  Ours gets lots of use every day and yet looks like it just came out of the box brand new.  Plus, unlike a bottle warmer appliance, there are no moving part or electrical components to wear out or break, so we expect we'll be using ours for years/babies to come.	3
I used one of these for years working on ag airplanes, which consist of dozens of panels held together with hundreds of stainless steel phillips machine screws that cost about $1 each.  The torque setting keeps you from stripping the heads.  The lock setting will even let you operate &quot;dzus&quot; fasteners with a flat blade.  The interchangable batteries keeps you going all day.If you have lots of screws to take out and put back in, this tool will keep the blisters at bay!  It ought to be great on sheet metal, too.	21
Nothing fancy about this strap, unless you want to count the pick pocket at one end. Just well made and functional.I got this for my grandson's Squier (by Fender) 3/4 size acoustic. It doesn't have a strap button at the top end. It would have been nice if this had come with a lace of some type to tie on just above the nut. But I work with leather and I found a nice piece of rawhide lace to serve this purpose. Not everyone would necessarily have the materials at hand.	16
"Hemmingway transcribes his expat experiences in the Spanish American war into a gripping story of the futility of combat.  The main characters hide in the hills struggling between loyalty to their anti-fascist cause, and the scars caused by the attrocities they've experienced.For whom the bell tolls, as we all know, ""It tolls for thee!"" This summarizes the story.  To Hemmingway, war is futile.  We all lose.  Agree or disagree with the morality, the story captures Hemmingway's ability to lay emotions bare with strong minimalist prose and dialogure."	5
I dislike wrapping Christmas gifts.  I am horrible at it and if the present doesn't come out with a big ball of paper around it, then it is a major triumph of my soul.  This tape is thick enough to help me calm my wrapping paper beast.  And it holds down velvet ribbon when I don't have enough of it to go all the way around the box and have to tape it piecemeal around the bottom.  It's invisible and matte, so it makes my oddball wrapping look put together.  A wonderful thing.  Five stars.	17
I purchased these on a gold box whim.  They are larger than I expected, and the rose color is not really discernible.  They look yellow gold to me.Yes, I'll probably keep them and no, I wouldn't recommend them to others.  They are much too large for second ear piercings.  They aren't the style I usually wear.  So far, the backs have securely held them in each ear and the posts are reasonable diameter.  They appear to be adequately made, but don't really look like high quality earrings.	8
In all honesty, I'd rather not use this type of chemical product on my dogs.  I resisted for as long as I could but the so-called natural products were, sadly, ineffective.  I was pulling off a tick a day from them and I found a few of the little suckers crawling on me.  That was the last straw, so enter Frontline.  Bottom line, it works better than anything else I've tried. There's nothing more to say about it, except if someone knows about an effective natural/less chemically product, please let me know.	19
There is no way that these were originally $70 headphones.  Yes, I liked them for a while and worked great with the iPhone. Sound was pretty good and great for call.  Then they suddenly just stopped working on the one ear, wire looked connected fine, I was able to wiggle it to get some sounds for a little while, but overall it just died.  Not pleased that I now have to buy some new ones and disappointed that these just did not last for even a year.	7
I've used Trilene XL Smooth Casting mono on all of my spinning reels for at least the last 20 years and for good reason - it casts so well.  This low memory monofilament is smooth through the eyelets during casting, and it has low memory so it doesn't coil up as quickly over time after being left on your reels out in the garage.  I use my spinning reels less than my baitcasters, but this line gives me a good 6 months of use/storage before needing to be replaced.	20
It's a fairly good headset. Negatives: does a poor job of screening out wind noise & other noises; when I make a 2nd call, it doesn't always find the phone & I have to punch a few buttons to get it working again.Positives: very comfortable - I forget I have it on; fairly discreet looking; battery life is very good; hooks up to my phone (Treo 700p) seamlessly - I very rarely have to pair it up again; I can hear very well, even in my noisy diesel pickup!	7
I ordered the H700 after reading a number of good reviews. I got it from Circuit City, so it's not a 'counterfeit'.  It pairs well with my Moto Q9C, and it is very comfortable- but thats the end of the good things I can say about it. The volume is too low for me to hear callers if there is any ambient noise, and the static which happens sporadically *usually when I'm on an important call makes this virtually unusable.  I guess I will RMA and see if this one is a dud and the replacment is any better.	7
This compost starter really speeds things up. I use a tumbler as well as a compost pile which is reserved for leaves, branches and the like. Although the package says you will get humus in 60 to 90 days, I am already seeing progress.  Despite a cold snap, the compost is progressing.This product was sent with the box contained in a plastic bag.  There was some leakage although no obvious rips or tears.Nothing works like progress and this product does speed the composting process. Recommended.	18
Gave it a high rating as it's free and does more than i thought it would for free. Alot of free app's are just that free, you open and u can't use most of the features cause thay want a fee to do so. This one is simple to use and move around in. Streaming live TV, news vid's, news articles, my stocks watch list, and alot more. Sometimes with a weaker connection u can't load vids or watch live TV. but everything else loads well on weak signals. I recommend this app to all.	1
"...you get a piece of plastic laminate covered fiber board that does not even sit flush with the top of the table saw (it sticks up about 1/32"").  Supposedly this device is supposed to help stabilize the saw blade (especially a thin-kerf blade), reduce chipping and noise.  This may be true, but then it should be a standard feature that comes with the saw rather than the regular insert.  I would skip this and build one yourself for a fraction of the cost."	21
I'd give this 1 and a half stars if I could. This little Amp is so noisy if you hardly touch/move a cable plugged into it. It is so hard to get full sound in head/earphones with this. I can only hear in one ear in every headphone/output, and hardly anything in the other. I have to always adjust my cable's connector to get any full sound for a second. I can still use this, but hardly. I really don't like this.	16
I had looked high and low for a 1 ounce souffle cup and lid set for our lunchboxes.  The only ones I could find were disposable, and I strive to make our lunches completely trash free.  (See some of my other reviews)The Smidgets are the perfect size for salad dressings, little candy treats or marshmallows, raisins, nuts...if it's little, it flies!  You'll love them.  I followed the tip from another Amazon reviewer and boiled them for 1 minute then re-sealed them while they are still hot to make the lids easier to take on and off.  Worked like a charm.	13
"I love this diaper pail...you can use any trash bags...I like the variety that are colored and scented for a nice touch! It's so easy to use. I didn't have any problems with odors til my daughter got older than 12 months. Once she started eating more ""real"" foods, her diapers became much smellier. She's now 19 months and the Champ is still a Champ. We empty it a little more frequently now than we used to because of her smellier diapers, but I think it's a great product!"	3
These are a nice improvement over the older style printable card stock. They separate very cleanly, by 'snapping' then inwards towards you.I printed on both sides using the templates from the site provided in the instructions. It was intuitive enough for the average user to setup the cards and print them easily.The colors were vivid, and did not smear when you rubbed your fingers over the cards, after leaving them sit for a few minutes to let them set.All in all a good value, and they look good enough to substitute for print shop printed cards.	17
This is a perfect puzzle for my 2.5 and 4.5 year old daughters.  Puzzles with a few animals are much easier to work with than the ones with one big animal.  That, coupled with the colorful images are enough to keep them fully engaged.  My 2 year old can work on it by herself, but at some point she needs help in completing it.  We are moving soon, and this is definitely one of the puzzles we will keep.  Others, we will give away.My wife and I are very satisfied with this product and recommend it.	22
I am 71 and have carpal tunnel and cubital tunnel syndromes of the right hand/arm.  This can opener is a joy to use and requires not much strength to open a can.  Didn't want an electric can opener sitting out all the time and they wind up not working after a while anyway. The manual cheapies are hard to work and I've gone through about 5.  So stupid since I would have saved money just paying up front for a good one.  Can't tell you how pleased I am with this OXO can opener.  It's worth the money.	13
Its OK, the adjust ability is not what i would like but it does have some uses and its built like a tank. i got this for free from my girlfriend who had it given to her from some old guy who told her it was a broken distortion pedal so i can't complain about it not being worth what i paid for it. i currently have this on my pedal board along with a Digitech MainSqueeze which is less expensive, more adjustable and just more versatile. would i buy this, yes if i didn't try anything else first. nuff said.	16
The winder works well for me, and the cutter is good to have connected to the tool (so I don't have to search out a pair of snips), but a spring loaded cutter would be less awkward.  Also, the bridge pin puller is kinda flimsy, and doesn't work well for reluctant pins.  I actually like my Dunlop winder better; this tool is longer so it comes off of the pegs a little more, but I guess that's the compromise of having a working cutter, so I won't be throwing away my other winder any time soon.	16
I use Frontline Plus every month on my 25 pound mutt and so far it has worked perfectly. She has had no flea, tick, or lice infestations whatsoever. In fact, I've witnessed ticks jumping on to her and then jumping or falling off soon after without attempting to burrow beneath her fur. The chemicals in Frontline Plus are absorbed into the dog's skin and are very effective. I don't like to think about how they might be harming the dog....she seems not to notice the monthly application or the slight chemical smell.	19
I still say England has it all over America when it comes to TV programs.  They don't seem to need guns and kill, kill, kill in order to keep an audience.  The manor house of the 1800's is very intriguing.  Yes, if you were born into the right family you had a title and an easier life.  The working class was considered second rate.  But the job position you held in the manor did allow a &#34;common&#34; person some prestige.This is a show worth watching and describes life as it was in England back in the 1800's.	15
I love having something quick and tasty (enough) on hand at work to heat up for lunch when I forget, or a snack on the days I'm extra hungry! However, the top is all broth and the bottom all noodles! Since I have to use a spoon anyway I prefer to have soup in a bowl, so the convenience of this is really negated.. still.. It's pretty tasty for a canned soup and I'll probably keep having one on hand for the occasions I have nothing else.	11
This OXO Can Opener replaces a similar opener of a different brand that, after probably 8 months of use, became difficult for me to use.  -  I appreciate this so much.  It simply, easily and quickly completes the job.  I have used it almost every day for about a month now and find that it readily punctures the lid; the large handle turns quite easily for my somewhat painful finger joints; the edges of the can lid are not as sharp as some other openers have left them.  I readily recommend this to you..	13
The strings ripped off when I tried to pull it off of the crib. I also didn't like the idea of this being on top of the mattress and crib sheets. So it might be a good idea if you don't have a great baby mattress or aren't into decorating the baby space. At first I thought this product was clever, but once I got it I realized how useless it was. It's so easy to take the crib sheet off of my baby's crib, so I really never needed this.	3
As the picture shows, you loop the lock through a stable object then lock it to the laptop's security slot (some notebooks won't have it, I have an Dell Inspiron which has it).If you leave your notebook computer unattended and there is no one around a determined thief could just break it off of the security slot attached to the computer.  It doesn't feel too stable there.  They would have damaged good however.  This prevents my notebook from being walked away with when I am at the library.  Its worth paying $30 to protect a $2000 toy.	10
The factory fence sucked bad. I added the Rousseau 2600 fence system and it now a different saw, plenty of power, now very accurate. I use the portable setup in the bed of truck, sitting the saw on the tailgate at least 3 times a week ripping material for jobs. Bought this saw for $151 atHD so even happier at that price. Rousseau was $101 with all the Amazon deals available at the time, $30 off, Gold Box, and A9. Believe it or not I still like my old 2708 better.	21
I received this tub as a gift at my baby shower.  I looked at it and thought what a great idea for a tub.  Wrong!!  First of all, the tub leaks.  You cannot let go of the baby for one second beacause they will slide.  My son absolutely hated bath time until I bought the seat that sits in the bath tub and now he is happy.  The sides of the ramp are hard and if they move there head to quickly they could hurt themselves.  I wouldn't recommend this to anyone.	3
I placed this collar on my dog it took several barks from him then all of a sudden he yelped really loud and all 4 paws left the ground, he leaped about  a foot into the air.  I instantly removed the collar and had to calm him down.  I never put it on him again this is not the way to train a dog it's cruelty.  I felt so bad I did this to him.  I sure wouldn't want 2 prongs sticking in my neck shocking me.	19
This scope is great. i sighted it in very quickly the click adjusters are accurate, this went on my marlin 22 magnum and its perfect for it. when i went to sight in the sun was very bright and directly in my face the scope didnt pickup any of the glare the crosshairs are nice and thin, it comes only with scope covers. it works great when its basicly dark. you could probly see 100 yards at night under a full moon. it was better than my own eyesight. i woild recomend this to anyone.	20
I purchased 2 packs and I'm quite happy with these. I didn't measure the wire size but they are larger and heaver than a set I bought several years ago from another site.The clips are attracted to a magnet so I know they are not Aluminium and could probably be souldered if I wanted to (that's good).  I checked them with a Ohm meter and the connections were all good. The boot is soft and flexible. Well worth the price for those of us that are DIY's.	2
I can't really complain about this stapler. I love Swingline products and this is no exception. It does tend to jam once in a while, which I would expect from an $8.00 stapler. I have other staplers from Swingline that I absolutely love! My favorite so far is the Swingline LightTouch Reduced Effort Stapler which is a little bit more, but totally worth the extra few dollars.All in all, though, this is a fine stapler and I haven't had the same problems with it as others have.	17
I have owned ny DeWalt for about eight months. Sometimes the on/off switch gets caught but really no trouble. I have probably put close to 500 hours of heavy duty work with this. C &amp; D side plywood, raw wood as well as refinishing. I just had to replace the pad today as it losts its grip on the sandpaper. But again a very minor problem. My sole major problem is how hot the handle gets after about two hours of consistent sanding. However, the finish is beautiful and I would highly recommend it to anyone.	21
my wife and i have bought at least four sets of tongs including two that appeared to have good gripping ability. none of them were worthy of taking up storage space! we were just about to give it up when i saw the oxy good grip tongs on amazon. i read all the reviews, went for it,and bought it. the reviews were right on target. what a great pair of tongs! steaks, chicken quarters, even a slab of ribs were no problem. please take my word for it,in the world of tongs they have no equal!	13
The story was great. I am a big fan of horror/mystery/suspense. This had everything, white knuckle moments, breath holding suspense, a little gore to make you a little sick. My only problem was that it was way too short. I was so intrigued by the story that I wanted it to go on for at least a few more chapters. The story line was there, so did the author run out of ideas? The author needs to read a little Stephen King to learn how to extend a story. What a great creepy one this could have been.	14
I picked this potty up 2 days ago and I really can't complain.  My daughter is 9 months old and seems to have no problem with it.  I do understand some of the concerns with pee coming out because it happened to us yesterday.  I didn't make a big deal about it and it didn't seem to bother her.  I happened to have it sitting on a waterproof pad, just incase, so nothing got on my carpet.  But she seems very comfortable on it.	3
Spectrum Light Canola Mayo is an eggless mayonnaise substitute. I bought a jar of this at my local store, as it was on clearance and I'm trying to avoid eating real egg products. It has a very good smell, like real mayonnaise; however, I was put off by its gummy texture. It has a passable flavor-somewhat tangy like the real stuff-but it also tastes very floury. The biggest downside to this mayo is that it leaves a terrible aftertaste for hours. I won't be buying this mayonnaise again.	11
"From the other reviews, i was expecting to have my socks knocked off as I had in ""The Glass Castle"" by Jeannette Walls and ""Replay"" by Ken Grimwood, but instead I found that I was pleasantly entertained. No more. No less. The most impressive parts of this book were Sara's portrayal of the elderly. I imagine that life for the elderly is pretty much as she portrays it, which I found enlightening and interesting. These parts ended up being my favorite! The rest of the book is colorful, imaginative, and worthwhile."	5
No Doubt is probably the best alternative band out there, with second runners up by Garbage. My favorite tracks listed on TRAGIC KINGDOM are &quot;Spiderwebs&quot;, &quot;Just A Girl&quot;, and &quot;Don't Speak&quot;. I could actually really care less for the other songs on this CD, but I still enjoy No Doubt which was the reason why I gave this 4 stars. Anyway, if you love bands like Garbage than you should definitely get TRAGIC KINGDOM. Also get RETURN OF SATURN, which is No Doubt's new CD-release. Highly recommended.	9
"I think this is an album where either you're into it, or you aren't -- it isn't an issue of whether it's a ""good"" record, or a ""bad"" one.  As a fan of Costello's early work, as well as a fairly well-informed country fan, I've found this to be an album that's grown on me over the years. He knew what is was doing, and he did it well. (DJ Joe Sixpack, Slipcue Guide To Country Music)"	9
"I have many live CD's of Bob Marley, but this DVD has some of the best live versions of a lot of songs like ""Crazy Baldhead"", ""The heathen"", and ""Exodus"".Of course all the DVD is great but this 3 songs I want this versions on CD.I can't believe that there isn't a CD of this concert, but I looked all over Amazon and couldn't find any.Please somebody help me I am desesperate to have this songs on a CD.Thanks in advance and sorry for my bad english.If somebody can help me, my mail=ricpir@gmail.com"	6
They work and for the price I cant complain to much. The construction of the unit is almost all plastic and the ocular bridge flexes when you put any pressure on it. Though its nice to have a set of Bino's that don't break the bank if one of the young ones drops/damages/loses them. At 16x they can be little shaky off hand but I use this set primarily for spotting during rim fire shooting games and these binoculars make seeing .22lr bullet holes at 50yds very easy to see and score.	10
This is just a CD you've got to have.  Once you've gotten to know it, you'll start hearing Drake's influences in musician after musician who knows what he/she is doing.  Beck, Robyn Hitchcock, Jim White, Lucinda Williams, David Byrne, Vic Chesnutt.  That's just for starters. The list of people who cite Nick Drake as an influence goes on and on. Once you get this CD, you'll want to dig into Drake's entire catalog, which, unfortunately, is only 3 or 4 official albums.  Amazing musician who made an incredible splash in his short life and limited number of recordings.	9
The first thing that stuck out for me in The Unmasking of Lady Loveless was the great characters. The author did a wonderful job in such a short piece of writing and I felt her talent really shone through for the genre.With an orginal storyline and interesting twists along the way, this historcial reeled me in and kept me enchanted right to the end.For those who rag on the length, you do realize this is a short? That's the whole point of The Undone Line. If you somehow feel ripped off, I suggest making yourself aware of that before buying.	14
"Nintendo power voted it the worst game everGamestop and spot hate itI was unfortunate enough to stumble upon this game at my local video store. I thought ""superman, I'll have to try that"". I have never seen a game more deserving of the following: THIS IS THE WORST GAME EVER! IT DESERVES TO BE BURNED!!! IT IS A DISGRACE TO INTELLIGENT BEINGS EVERYWHERE! MAKIND SHOULD BE ASHAMED OF ITS POOR ABILITY TO CREATE GAMES! IT IS UTTERLY POINTLESS! IT MAKES SOUTH PARK LOOK LIKE SHAKESPEARE! IT MAKES ALIEN HOMINID SEEM EASY AND SOPHISTICATED!Somewhere far, far away, Superman weeps."	23
I noticed stretch marks on abdomen got lighter and less noticeable. It doesn't take them away. It is very true that stretch marks are permanent because your middle layer of skin has actually torn. This product can be pricey but it is worth the money especially if you don't have many stretch marks. But if you have a lot of large ones You can try a TCA chemical peel. I have noticed that they strengthen the skin by improving collagen and elastin production which in proper amts keeps the skin from tearing.	12
Both camera body and lens appear to have been made in Japan.  But in using the equipment, will entail a lot of guess work, though.  The exposure meter is quite difficult to figure as there's no indicator (light or arrow) to set proper exposure.As of now, I'm still deciding if I'll keep or return the whole package.  So, please provide instructions on how to return everything.  The merchant, GLOBooks does not even have a a mailing address.  But nonetheless, I would like to know how I can return everything.Thanks.mike caguin5909 Panorama Dr. SE - #3-102Auburn, WA  98092	10
Not much to say here, but I like when products I'm looking at have reviews.These are durable, good, effective... Basically, they are exactly what you want when you are looking for replacement tips for your gum stimulator. Also, they are inexpensive. I will definitely buy these again when I need more!Note: They may seem stiff at first, but you are supposed to run them under hot water to soften them before use. It took me a while to figure that out. I think it's on the package, but I don't remember.Anyways, good product. 5 stars!	12
The eggs are difficult to get apart and whilst younger kids may be able to match the shapes they do not yet have the dexterity to get the eggs apart and back together again. My daughter is four and has difficulty getting the eggs apart. She does use them in her pretend kitchen though. The colors are nice and they look like real eggs - so it is basically a good product, but if you are thinking of them for a two year old think again - they will only get frustrated. Better to wait until they are older unless you can assist.	22
This was just the ticket for my 50lb. terrier-sheepdog mix!  He has been doing some hardore chewing and this bone has really held up for a long time.  I usually replace them with a fresh one every couple of months and never once has pieces been broken off.  His chewing just creates a raised surface, its more like it reshapes rather than breaks off if that makes any sense.  This is a great product and will continue to buy the dura chew bones for my dog!	19
"Easy to assemble!!  Sturdy!!  Works very well.  I thought the clear plastic was a good idea.. With it, you don't really need to remove the item to see your Computer screen.  It seems to be of very good quality.  I didn't give it another star 'cause I wished it would have been a bit easier to remove when needed.  It kind of ""bends in the middle"" when moving it.  But, all in all a handy item to have around."	17
I have used this twice now.  Once for baby back ribs (pork loin back) and once for St. Louis style trimmed spare ribs.  It worked great both times, but was easier with the spare ribs than the baby backs.  This was because the spare ribs were straighter (less curve to the rib bones) than the baby backs and stood upright better.  The curve in the baby back ribs made it slightly more difficult to remove a single rack of ribs to rotate it.  But this was a minor issue.  Overall the unit worked great.	18
I bought these almost three years ago. But you know what? They're still hanging in my bar putting out good music. Well, I play the good music. These just happen to perform the actions needed to make that sound audible. But that's beside the point. Look, they're not like super bass-heavy subs. They're just well balanced affordable speakers that sound great in a bar. They get plenty loud and they look plenty good. I have mine mounted up on the ceiling and hardly anyone notices them. UNTIL THEY GET THEIR DAMN FACES ROCKED OFF. Should have paid attention, suckas.	10
it doesn't wear well under make-up. It's just a little oily. Other than that...I love this product. I use it mainly on my neck and chest (and on my face on my days off) and it has evened out my skin tone and faded my sun-spots ALOT. Especially on my chest...HUGE difference from a few years ago! It really is a great All-in-One Product- I've been using it for years and haven't found a better one yet. I'll keep on buying it!	4
This is a very cool product made with just three pieces of stainless steel.It folds up into a very small space and holds a small to medium sized book in a near-vertical, open-face position with a certain panache.But if you're working from a very thick book, you need a different bookstand. The convenience disappears when you have to be finessing some of the pages of a large book onto the outside of the vertical 'placeholder' and the rest of them on the inside.I like the idea. 'Shame they don't make a large size, too.	17
When the wheel works you don't always need to reinvent it to have a nice product. That's the concept that Yard Butler did here.With this hose mount you get solid construction, heavy weight design, but something practical that will hold up and last.Very easy to install two screws and you're done, though the screws are not included which isn't a big deal. I like the extra height on the front bar as it allows for more hose to be stored. I have zero complaints about this, solid and well made. Not sure what else you can ask for with this.	18
"I got this charger along with a Garmin n&uuml;vi 855. The charger does what it says it does, and charges the GPS just fine. The only problem I have isn't really with the charger, but with the GPS. When the charging through the USB port like this charger does. The GPS stays powered on in ""USB Connected Mode"" the whole time. You can't turn it off, and so the screen, back-light, and maybe the GPS antenna are running while charging. Thus, increasing the time needed to charge."	10
I have been doing this kind of cash flow monitoring in excel for many years and have finally found a good replacement with this app.  I like the future recurring transactions capability the best so I can forecast my cash flow multiple months at a time.  I would give this app the full 5 stars but the backup and export features cause the app to force close.  this is very unfortunate as I purposefully bought the app with these features in mind.  oh well.  it still rates high for me anyway.  htc incredible.	1
Have you ever read a line, first you feel the language is beautiful and next a thought, even a reality hits you? And even after you have finished, the message keeps playing on and on in your mind? Well, this book is one of them (if you have luckily found other books by other author).It is the exploration of self, soul, community, nature, and universe. No matter what religion you hold, from where you came or who/what you are. This is a book for every human being to know and keep in perspective what they are doing everyday.	5
I initially bought this item to help with the minor pain I get daily from inflammation.  However, I find it works ok for the inflammation, not as good as I had hoped, but by surprise it certainly helps with my night sweats and hot flashes.  They have decreased immensely and I don't feel so uncomfortable when I'm shopping and break out into a great sweat.  Not sure which item in this does the trick, but I'm one happy camper.  I sleep better too!  Give it a try, it's not a bad price either.	19
I've tweaked mine and added 3rd party programs, but you can't get around the fact that it's pretty darn hard to make a simple phone call without the stylus, and it's especially frustrating to use the keypad for call options (e.g. voice mail) once your call is connected.  This just plain sucks.Basic phone call operations turn into a two handed procedure, pretty dangerous when you're on the road.After 5 months with this phone, I'm really missing a phone that has a keypad.  I've gone back to my Nokia 73 and will continue shopping for a better Windows Mobile device...	7
"Took me a bit, but I'm a convert after running out and going back to normal tea.  Wasn't obvious at first but became apparent the day I had to switch ""cold-turkey.""Great flavor, enough caffeine, and no need to add anything.  Will be buying more.vs PGtips and Yorkshire Gold.________________(+) Less astringent(+) Does *not* get bitter with long steeps.(+/-) Caffeine is same as Yorkshire/PG tips(+) Beats yorkshire Gold in flavor (difficult to tell differences if you take sugar/milk/lemon/etc.)"	11
After having my baby I developed a rash on my hands from overwashing and extremely dry skin. I visited a dermatologist who prescribed me a steroid cream to get rid of the rash and samples of this hand cream. He insisted I use this every time I wash my hands to keep them moisturized so I would not have another rash breakout. I have been using this for over a year now and do not have dry chapped skin. I still wash my hands about 20 times a day so this is a life saver!	4
"I have hoped that this series would be continued past the first three stories - in vain.  If you like Foyle's War (which has, fortunately, been continued), you will like Heat of the Sun.  It's realistic; it's intelligent.  It can be uncomfortable because this is not a pretty world.  On the other hand, there are ""good guys"", just like in the real world, and, just like in the real world, they are not cartoon cut-outs, but flawed humans who are heros nonetheless.  I very much recommend this series."	15
A clasically-styled and introverted album, Memory of Trees is a masterpiece of subtlety.  Many of the songs have an endearing shyness to them - soft piano and a lovely, quiet voice.  But within every introvert is an inferno, and Enya lets that fire explode on a couple of songs that absolutely burst with an expected raw power.If you've never heard Enya before, you might want to start with one of her more popularized works, like Watermark, just to play it safe.  But if you're already a fan, then your collection is not complete without this beautiful work of musical art.	9
I don't think I've every enjoyed scooping leaves as much as I have with the Gardex scooper. I was able to scoop and gigantic pile of leaves under 5 minutes!The scoop itself is very well made. High quality plastic, easy to use and handle. I have medium to large hands and had no problem fitting them into the scoopers.Simply put them, on, reach down and squeeze the leaves, hold firmly and pick up. THAT simple and yet so incredibly efficient. A MUST buy for any home owner.By the way, this item is made with pride in the U.S.A.	18
"I use bore snakes for both pistols and long rifles...After forty years of using the ""classic"" rod, brush, patch system of cleaning 1911 .45s, M-16s, M-60s, .22 rifle, 9 mm pistols, .308 and 30-06 rifles, using ANY other method is simply a non starter...  The bore snake is simple, reliable, and much less hassle for routine cleaning.One thing that is different about the bore snake is that it is a bit messy to handle during and after use, so I use rubber gloves when cleaning weapons, and store the bore snake in a Ziploc bag...."	20
"R. Kelly's 1995 self titled album is a classic R&B album. It's an album that all music fans must have. R.kelly is the best R&B artist ever. he released of 7 albums, each one I would give a 5 star rating, and who ever wouldn't, is crazy. But this is his album I would consider his best album. It has 16 of his greatest tracks ever, including his classic hit ""Down Low"" and other great songs like ""Thank God It's Friday"" and ""Hump Bounce"" Cop this album, you can't have a music collection without it."	9
The pile of manure being the innumerable other cop shows out there that do the same exact thing. How on earth do all of them have viewership's? They don't deserve them. They are fairly unoriginal.Not so with Life. It is delightful. The style and such of the cinematography is sleek but unique, a hard combination to come by.The writing is so much fun. One minute deadly serious. One minute laugh out loud funny. And always sharp no matter what.Acting is incredible in every way. Story is fun.Watch this instead of those other shows that are simply boring and tired.	0
As with everything else I've found in the world of shotguns, this 20/12 ga. accessory is better suited for a 20 gauge, but will work alright for a 12. Reason being, the loops for the shells are tight enough to be inconvenient on the larger 12 gauge shells.The buckle is strong and secure, and the belt works just fine, otherwise. I would rather pay a little more and have the choice between the two sizes, but this item would work okay for hunting, as there's not really a rush to reload. It's not a great tactical accessory.	20
This item is made well, which means that I will likely be able ot use it for several years.  The pockets are large enough that my two and four year old can get out the items and return them without tearing the pockets.  Additionally, each item has a number on the back, so my daughters can return each item to the correct spot.  I didn't want to spend a lot of money, but this proved to be worth it as my daugthers played with this almost every day and it is showing no wear.	22
I gave it 2 stars because I liked the concept -- alien life purposely brought back to Earth, accidentally let loose -- so I decided to give it a go.  So not worth it. Nothing happens.  Nothing.  It is boring.  No, let me correct that.  It is BOOOOOORING!!!!  Way too many areas of the plot left unexplored; way too much meaningless conversation that does nothing to advance the plot; way too little character development; way too many unanswered questions; and the &#34;plot twist&#34; at the end was incomplete.	0
Yep, it's one of the truly great chipotle sauces around.  It's probably my favorite chipotle sauce although there are a few others that are in still in the running.  It really tastes nothing like the original Tabasco, another favorite hot sauce of mine.  I probably use the chipotle sauce more than the original Tabasco.  One of my favorite ways to use it is in spicing up ranch-style dressings for use in salads and dips.  It works wonders in barbeque sauce and to spice up bastes to use on the smoker.  Great smokey flavor.	11
Depending on the amp and guitar you have, this pedal is going to either really be great or be a bummer. It sounds terrific with my fender strat (single coil) Danelectro (lipstick pickups) on my solid state amps, giving them a warm tube like overdrive.It sounds terrible on my tube amp and my vintage silvertone amp, it really sounds aweful with my 1980's Kramer, loaded with humbucker pickups.You'll either love it or hate it! That will decide mostly on the type of guitar and amp you use, it's a different pedal with every combination.	16
Works but got rid of it because of the loud mechanical sounds from the internal gears -- squeaking, grinding, crunching sounds. Much worse than my previous Maxell adapter.  Poor manufacturing! Ordered the Philips USA PH-62050 CD/MP3/MD-To-Cassette Adapter for which the Amazon reviews about noise are much better (and it's a buck cheaper to boot).  Indeed, the Philips was very good.  Buy it. Don't buy the Maxell. You'll be happier.UPDATE to review: about a year after purchase, the Philips is making louder and louder noises.  I guess noise is endemic to these adapters.	10
"is what I said when my 24yr old asked if I would buy him a helicopter! Glad he didn't want the real thing. Anyway, he said that he likes it so far, he played with it most of the day when he got it. He likes that it doesn't make ""crash"" landings, and he was pleased with the look and performance of it. Although he did mention making some minor adjustments..like removing the flashing lights..and one other thing that has to do with a spring in the controller. Anyway, I think it was worth it to see the smile on his face!"	22

I read this accounting in about 20 minutes.  It's a brief, concise accounting of the surgeon who attended President Lincoln during his final hours before succumbing to the mortal gunshot wound to the head.  I enjoyed how the surgeon set the stage a few moments before President Lincoln was shot, the 9.5 hours that he lived after being shot, and the events that happened up to the point of the funeral.  I felt the the surrealness, panic, excitement, and sadness that Dr. Leale felt.  This of course is a story from the surgeon's point of view.	14
Its been about 10 years since I got my first TrackMan Marble FX. At this time I still have 3. Having tried just about every type and variation of input device on the planet, I never found any other mouse device the equal of the TMFT.Of course, being a 10 year old design, never updated, it lacks the buttons and scrolling abilities of modern mice. Which is too bad, because if Logitech revived this trackball, and updated it with 2 more buttons and new software, it would outsell everything else on the market by a wide margin.	10
this is exactly what it looks like.  when the junk plastic catch broke on my RV, I replaced with this.  since the catch is so long, I had to bend it a bit to make the angle right, but thats due to my mounting.  no fault on the product.  this thing holds the door securely and looks like it will stand up to sun and ran much better than the plastic ones.  It's been installed for about 3 months now with no trouble yet.	2
I received a defective one the first time and it would take forever to load any file or it wouldn't load it at all.  So we contacted the company through amazon and they sent us another one free of charge.  The second one works just fine and have not had any problems with it.  It is nice being able to save all my old files on a computer and not having to lose them.  It also works great for if you want to install an old operating system on another computer that doesn't accept floppy disk.	10
This stuff has a million uses in the garage and around the house/yard.  Any fastener that may rust, corrode, or otherwise lock up, just put a thin coat on the threads and don't worry...it'll come right off next time.  Use it on axle bolts, lug nuts, spark plugs, really any nut, bolt, screw, or anything exposed to the elements that you don't wan to seize.  And for the price, an 8oz bottle will last you for years!	2
These are really great tomatoes. I hate the metalic taste canned tomatoes have and if they taste like the can chances are it has leached into the tomatoes, can't be healthy. These are very rich in flavor and not at all watery. Great as a sauce with just some virgin olive oil, fresh basil and garlic, s&p cook pasta firm and finish cooking in the sauce, simple and delicious! Love these tomatoes, wish I could find it locally but at least I can get it from amazon, what did we ever do without amazon?!	11
I deal with quite a bit of electronic musical instrument gear from guitars, basses, amps, FX, MIDI gear, etc.  Over time most of it starts suffering from scratchy / noisy pots (knobs), input and output jacks that are crackly, etc.In the past I've tried some Locktite electronics cleaner, which is provided in a similar can. It would rarely work.In contrast this has cleaned every piece of gear I've used it on saving me from having to physically replace the pots and jacks. It's really like magic in a can.	16
I liked my Elixir strings on my acoustic, so I knew that the ones for electric would be worth the extra money (as compared to non-coated brands).  They seem to create less noise from unintentional slide friction--it's sort of like the difference between flatwound and regular strings--these feel like super-flatwound strings, meaning they feel smooth.  I have some nice callusses built up, but I imagine that I'd like these strings even more if I was just starting out (or restarting) because I imagine they tear up your fingertips much less than non-coated strings.	16
and I mean it. It is the second time I read the book since it was released it. The first time I couldn't turn it down, so gripping it was, but then I did miss a lot. This time I used time, and really, it was worthwhile. I think that whoever like good science fiction and have some concern for life and what sustain it, should read it. I am waiting to read the second book, as I remember I liked even more, but I don't remember why. It will be fun to find out.	5
I bought this tracker when my daughter was 4 weeks old. I was having problems remembering how much she was eating, whether she was sleeping better or not. This helped me keep track of those things and more. I could look back and see if there were any changes in her eating habits - it wasI started using it like a little journal that my daughter can see when she's older. I kept notes about her moods, what she did during the day. It even became a good tool to use with my nanny once I went back to work.	3
I am so happy with these... they feel great and very sturdy.  The sizing chart was accurate... I am 5'6/200 and I ordered 1x/2x which fit fine.  The control top is very comfortable compared to other brands.  The fabric is very smooth, not too flimsy but not suffocatingly thick either. It also is not snagging like other nylons, nor do I notice any pilling.  They are so comfortable, and I expect to get many more wears out of these.  I am so impressed with these I just bought 2 more pairs.	8
If you need it, good unobtrusive device for front or as a momentary back strap.  Leather or simulated, this was quite adequate for my purposes.  Price was right! Delivery was immediate.  Rolls up to fit in gig bag and no doubt would adequately go into the hard case.  This one is compatible with the finish on my instrument, since it comes in at least two distinct color tones.Planet Waves Mandolin Strap, Brown.  Also comes in Black. There is also an embossed model (Brown) offered at minimumly higher price.	16
If you are looking for something to hold all your annual papers (as long as they are mostly 8.5&#34; x 12&#34; - this is a good option.  Expands as wide as you will need and made of durable quality vs. others I've used in the past which have torn.  I've taken one star off for the top flat closure.  Don't mind that it's thin.  Do mind that the velcro doesn't hold as well, or compress the folder as much as ones I've had with strings that go around them.	17
Exploration. Gothic Theme. Power-Ups. Great Music. Perfect Pacing. lots of Items. Huge variety of Enemies. Secret Areas. Well made puzzles.I really love the ambiance of this game. From the very start this world is just dripping with grit. The boss fights aren't too tough, but if you're like me you like feeling overpowered. Additionally, this game has several play modes. I don't want to spoil anything, but you can play as people other than Alucard. Or as a modified Alucard ;)MUST MUST MUST BUY! That is if you like Castlevania games...	23
but I'm hoping for some improvements. Haven't tried the desktop yet, but the Android app needs a few things.FB:inbox accessgroups accessthe ability to block feeds or delete invidual posts from within the apptagging for status and phototwitter:profile editingoverall:notifications of any type! (there are settings, but they've never worked for me)speedTumblr integrationplus when I compare to the browser, there are lost updates.I still use it, of course, but if anyone comes out with an app to address those problems with similar benefits, I'm switching right away, cute raccoon or not.	1
Fist let me say that I have used Tena for a long time. I have usually been very satisfied with it.The last two purchases were not that great. In the first one, 2 of the pads were not usable as they split as soon as you took the tape off.On the next package, there were 6 of the same thing. I am hoping that this is not a regular thing as these pads are expensive and should be intact.Hopefully this will be fixed soon and I can upgrade this review because I really like this product.	12
What can I say? This game is fun and funny at the same time. From mario flying around with the magic caps to Mario burning his [...] cheeks on the hot lava, this game is great! My only problem with this game is the freakin camera angles!!! AHHHHH sometimes I feel like I could just kick the Lakitu that controls the thing! Angles sometimes get soooo akward that it makes it difficult to make a jump correctly..or so you won't go flying down to your death. Other than that I give it a 4. Would be 5 if the camera was better.	23
I have a Tupperware bowl that is ancient and worn that is the oerfect bowl for mixing anything and everything.  It is no longer available.  I always keep an eye out for a replacement.  One day at work a close friend was complaining her favorite bowl was about to bite the dust.  I bought two of these one for her and one for me. NOT sorry!  Almost same size and shape but actually improved with non skid bottom and side grip. Pour spout is another bonus. Two happy cooks.	13
I got sick of using my &#34;Common&#34; funnel for different uses, trying to clean up an oily funnel so you can use it for Sea Foam is just dumb when you can get these for a little more than $1.  The size/length is perfect for gas-tank additives.  I purchased 3, I keep one in the garage to pour Sea Foam into my cara/motorcycle/snow-blower/lawnmower.  And the other 2 I keep in whatever vehicle I'm currently using, in my &#34;just in case&#34; pack.Great product.	2
"The mix sounds a little different for this edition -- which is something I haven't quite made up my mind about just yet -- but the real find here are the rare tracks found on the bonus disc, which range from brilliant (an early, more vemonous take of ""You Little Fool""; a completely altered ""Little Savage""), to weird-but-enlightening (""The Land of Give and Take""; rough, early run-throughs of ""Man Out of Time"").  All things considered, this is essential listening for the Costellophile and a great way to kill a few hours.  Or years."	9
Stevie Wonder has got to be the best entertainer of the century! I love this album. Actually, I love anything the man makes. But, I am not being biased here. This album is really a masterpiece. My favorites are Visions, Living For The City, Golden Lady and Don't You Worry 'Bout A Thing. This album is considered to be his best by many Stevie Wonder fans. Personally, I think that his best album was Songs In The Key Of Life. However, this album features the same brillance of that on SITKOL.	9
These are the best pair of headphones I've ever used.  I only had to buy this pair because I somehow broke my last pair (had for over 2 years).  The breaking was all my fault; nobody should expect a pair of headphones to survive being run over by a car.  Mea culpa!  Seriously though, the audio is the best I've ever heard from non-noise canceling headphones.  I use these on walks and jogs, so I need something that doesn't completely drown out ambient noise.  They do drown out softer noises (much more than earbuds) so be careful!	10
There are 50 folders in four colors; red, blue, green and yellow.Aside from using these to organize my paperwork and documents for tax time I am also using these to organize my sheet music. The folders are firm and the fasteners are sturdy. The folders also fit in a hanging folder in my filing cabinet and my portable file storage box. I also like these folders because they have fasteners on both sides of the folderallowing me to further separate my paperwork. If you are looking to organize any paperwork then I recommend these folders to make it much simpler.	17
For the price, it's an awesome value.  I fly more expensive Blade helis and quads so I know this Syma for $20 is a great value. Mine worked great out of the box.  Charged it up and flew all over the living room.  The controls are responsive and there is more than enough power.  I even flew outside at night.  The range outside is about 40'.  Beyond that, the signals gets lost or weak and the copter falls.  It was made for indoor using infrared so it's best suited for indoors.  Awesome quality toy for the low price.	22
This is such a great item and I can't say enough good things about it!  I use it several times a day for pacifiers, baby bottles, and breast pump bottles.  It couldn't be easier than popping things in the microwave for 5 minutes and knowing that your baby is getting sterilized items.A word of advice- be careful about removing it from the microwave.  The water inside and the steam can scald if you are not cautious.  Let it sit for a few minutes before opening, because the water can splash when opening the lid.	3
"I'm very pleased with this puzzle.  First each train car is 98% complete on each piece.  It leaves just a small part of the animal(s) ""missing"" which helps the child locate the next piece (for example, part of the 5th seal is missing on the #5 train car -- my nephew looked for the seal's face in order to find the #6 car as he doesn't yet recognize the numerals.  The pieces are thick and will last a long time.  The pictures are attractive without being too busy although the pics on the higher numbers are not placed for easy counting."	22
The first thing I noticed about this moisturizer is how smoothly my foundation went on after using it.  (I used to feel as if my moisturizer and face makeup were too much for my 48 year old face.)  I'm looking forward to the possible fading of age spots in the future with continued use.The price is better than Wal-Mart's if you subscribe and it really is a convenience.  If you run low before you're due for a shipment you can adjust the delivery.  I also subscribed to the eye cream and night cream.	4
This is a great and simple eBook reader. It's light enough that I can hold it in one hand when reading, it's small enough that it's easy to take with me, the battery life is long enough that I forgot where I put the charger, and the screen lets me read for hours on end without eye strain. It does one thing and does it well. Get a tablet computer (I am partial to the Toshiba Thrive) if you want to play games, do email, browse the web, do video conferencing, etc.	10
Gory, fun, and entertaining!  Yes, House of the Dead 2 is all that and then some!The graphics in this game are simply amazing; a perfect resemblance to that of the arcade game.  The animations and textures are used wonderfully.  Gameplay is pretty darn solid, and the replay value is tremendously good, especially if played multiplayer.Don't listen to those who find this game too &quot;difficult&quot; due to the lack of gun.  All you require is a controller, some skill, and quick reflexes.I highly recommend this game to all Dreamcasters!	23
I was told would enjoy this book by Clancy and wow I did.....Is a book that grabs you and the start and doesn't let go until the very last page.. I really got lost in this book, all the way thru is action and just when you want slow down more action jumps up for you..  Some books can be a little slow either at first, middle or toward the last, but not &#34;Without Remorse&#34; if you like action you will love this book as Clancy delivers all the way.....	5
We have tried everything to get even one bag to come out correctly.  Either it leaves LOTS of kernels in the bag and very little popcorn to eat OR it burns in big globs and at least 1/4 is burned.  We give up!  Our microwave is 1200 watts and we have tried the popcorn button AND numerous times tried other times AND we stand there and listen to it.  The kernels are still popping vigorously but it is burning inside.  Enough is enough.  What a shame because it is good tasting, what little we get from one  bag, but too frustrating.	11
"I bought this kit for putting into a pack for with the intention of being able to clean multiple calibers. I used it today for the first time and clean an AR-15 (5.56), a 12-Gauge, a Marlin .22, and a .22 Sig Mosquito. This kit cleaned them all with ease. I got anywhere from 3-6 cleanings out of each patch without a problem depending on the severity of the ""grime."" I am now comtemplating buying the Elite Cleaning Kit as my primary cleaning kit instead of all of the miscellaneous. Greatly impressed."	20
"""Woodstock"" is a nearly four-hour kaleidoscope of unremitting fascination. Musician and ""man/woman-in-the-street"" interviews are interwoven with concert performances, all of it presented in the then-ground-breaking format of multiple on-screen images. The divergent outlooks of adult town residents and visiting hippies shed an amusing light on what used to be termed ""the generation gap."" What everyone seems to share, regardless of age, is sheer awe at the enormous influx of humanity that fueled this largest of all ""happenings."""	6
I guess for the price I shouldn't complain much but the glass on my top was not cut straight. A very obvious curve was on the side of the glass and so I had to force the top down into my aquarium's rim. This probably wasn't a smart thing to do on my part but I'm not going to waste time shipping the item back and wait another week or more for a replacement. The glass also slips out of the plastic piece that allows it to be opened, possibly falling into the tank.	19
For a good, basic set of regular light gauge electric guitar strings, it's difficult to go wrong with D'Addario's EXL110s.  The range of thicknesses generally works well, and D'Addarios tend to be pretty consistent.  Some other brands may offer special features that go beyond what you get with the EXL110s (e.g. coating, super brightness, and so on), and some players prefer a slightly heavier or slightly lighter gauge string (e.g. sets that start with 9s or 11s), but for most purposes these work great, hold their tuning well, and seem to last pretty well, too.	16
The Lion of the Desert accurately documents the Libyian resistance to the Italian invasion in the 1920s. Anthony Quinn plays the role of Omar Muktar, leader of the Libyian resistance forces, and with his amazing chameleon-like ability seems to actually become the person he is portraying. Obviously, the movie makers spent millions to accurately reproduce the period Italian military armor and uniforms, but it was money well spent!! If you like movies with spectacular acting, historical accuracy, and casts of thousands, you will love this movie.	15
I cannot believe that so many people liked this book!  I thought it was garbage.  There was no plot, nothing but gore and violence.  It does not take talent to write stuff like this, just a very sick mind.  I did not think the book itself was scary, just the idea that there are people who think the way the authors do. They eat this stuff up and want more.  With all the great books that are available. why anyone would fill his mind with tales of depravity is beyond me.  SAVE YOUR MONEY!!!	14
This was one of the first albums I'd every purchased. From here I went on to collect most of Donovan's songs, and then later do it again. This is a fitting title, for it is a gift, still. Donovan, despite losing favor among modern poet-songwriters, is under-appreciated, in my opinion. The 22 songs on this album are among the best composed and released by Donovan. At the time this was originally released, in 1967, I found the popular Kahlil Gibran to be exceedingly compatible with thoughts and sentiments expressed by Donovan in song. Those who enjoy one should also enjoy the other.	9
Best shave yet. To prolong life, rinse blades after every use under regular sink water. Also, use 1/4 cup of alcohol and let blades sit for half hour once a month to remove grease and oils accumilated on the blades. Failure to do so, will eventually dull the blades and you will not get the long life you can get out of it. I have a medium growth beard shaving 4 times a week. I i dont have to replace the blades for years. I have been cleaning this way for over 30 years and very rarely replace the blades.	12
This is an addictive listen, with nothing that you'll want to skip while listening. This band may call itself christian, but the music on this cd is accessible to non-christians as well. You won't hear god-this and god-that anywhere in the lyrics, which (I can tell you) is refreshing; as so much christian rock has an amazingly inspiring sound, but falls short lyrically. Buy this album now. It is one of the most solid releases the genre has ever known. And it will constantly find its way into your ears again.	6
Ok so my friends house she thinks it's haunted so we took my kindle there and so many ghosts came up!!! We where terrified!!!!  But I don't get what red,blue,yellow,or green means?  I wish it would tell u!  But this is an awesome app and my house is like not full of ghosts but ya.  Talk to u later. :)  :) :)Have fun finding out your house is........HAUNTED!!!!!!	1
Yeah I'm a freak when it comes to my cars finish, I've used it all and don't get me wrong many great brands out there. This has to be considered with some of the best shy of the stupid expensive stuff which I just can't justify. This will shine like a Mother.....ops that's another brand...lol. Seriously lay one coat down and you'll be happy, then do a super light coat over that coat and wipe off with a light mist of water and prepare to be amazed !	2
I'd probably never have picked up this book on my own, but it was chosen by a book club I've been coerced into joining.  It was an enjoyable book and very quick to read.  It's the story of a young man who accidently joins a mangy circus during the depression following a personal tragedy, and grows up in the process.  The background of the circus, particularly at this time in recent history, was vivid and fascinating, and it would be worth reading the book for that alone.	5
The Good:  These tongs are cheap and adequate.  I needed a long pair of tongs with metal ends to work in the grill and hot pans and this this did the trick.  They open and close with ease, just like the smaller versions you can buy.  Additionally, arms of the tongs are well made.The Bad:  The ends of these tongs are very thin and mine came twisted a slight bit.  It all gave the impression of being slightly cheaply made, but for $15 you get what you pay for.	13
I recently read a review on the 2005 &#34;Expanded Edition&#34; of this great classic blues album. And could not believe that they would edit out the great guitar work Jeff Beck did on &#34;Mustang Sally&#34; so I bought it and compared the two. And sure enough it's gone along with some other less significant guest work on other cuts. So if you want to hear how this album was intended to be heard, the one that  won blues album of the year, get the original 1991 version FANTASTIC !!!!!!!!!	9
"I just bought this item to replace a 8-year old Zyliss spinner b/c I couldn't separate the lid for cleaning.  I knew the OXO was a great product since I already had the smaller one which I use for blueberries, cherries, herbs, etc.  But, this large OXO is heavier than my Zyliss and it's difficult for this senior woman with slight arthritis to handle.  I used to ""one hand"" the Zyliss (even full), but I have to use both hands to carry the OXO empty.  If it was lighter, I'd give it 5 stars."	13
Because I could not stop for milk,It kindly came to me.I ordered it through Amazon,Whole milk; sweet Tuscany.The driver, though, he knew no haste,No Expediter, he!The wait: Four days, and weekend, too.It seemed eternity.My milk, it passed through NYCWhere traffic snarled in rings,Slow past the fields of grazing cowsWho nodded knowingly.Its expiration date passed, too;And though the truck was chill,Vile germs digested lactose sweetAnd had their gruesome fill.It paused before my house at last,(By USPS Ground)My gallon jug; 128 ounceThough oddly swollen `round.My joy is dashed!

I absolutely loved this product so much that I am now buying them as gifts for everyone I know.  For anyone who is a heavy user of juice, this thing rocks!  It works better than all of the others I have used.  It is a must for business travelers!! For the price, buy three!Update 10/12I ended up pinching the USB input so I had to buy a new one.  I bought two more.  The sign of a good product is whether you would buy it again.  In this case, absolutely!!	7
I thought my  4 year old grandson would love this toy, as he is a great builder.  However, it didn't receive that response.  Why?  His pre-school already owned this and he plays with it there.  I thought that if his pre-school, which has very limited space, considered it worth owning, I was glad I bought it.I personally was fascinated with it, and probably played with it as much as he did.  There is something so satisfying about meshing gears and watching the movements!	22
Season 5 takes a turn with the introduction of Forest Whitaker as LT Jon Kavanaugh.  Prior to his departure, Kavanaugh had been tasked by Captain Aceveco to find the dirt on Vic.  Hellbent and determined, Kavanaugh does his best to do so.I don't know whether it was his character, his acting or the side story, but I didn't like the introduction of Kavanaugh to the series.  Sure, I believe many think the introduction may have been needed, but the subplot was often way too distracting.	0
"As with The Mister Trophy, I just thought this story was too short.  I really enjoyed reading it and thought it was well done.  My only problem is that there seemed to be the odd article missing and a word or two in it weren't in the Kindle dictionary such as ""haint"", which is a ghost.  I really love the characters, but I think Mama Hog is my favorite.  I recommend this series to anyone who wants a good, but short, fantasy story to read.  I will start on the next one in the series soon."	14
I'm usually drawn to books written about the depression era, as I have heard so much about it from my parents.  This book is not only that, but a great insight to the circus life during that time.  I had a hard time putting this book down in the evenings (after a day at work), and it was good timing that my spouse was out of town for the week.  Very well written, a great story, and a page turner. I'll be buying copies for future gifts.	5
I love this. I used to over in over color my hair blonde from Loreal and thena toner. omy it costs alot. I tried ash blonde and got purple tones.. so one day I waslike ok try this.. I am amzed. My hair is a light diamond blonde it is gorgous.I use the loreal shimmer blonde shampoo and cond. with this and wow so pretty.The color lasts me three weeks and feels and looks great. I also use a silk drops to makeit soft. It is nice. thanks..	4
I read this book last year and am sincerely hoping that the movie is able to sufficiently capture the adventure, romance, and poignancy.  I not only enjoyed the flashbacks to the days in the circus - I REALLY enjoyed the perspective of the character in a current day nursing home.  This book has it all and is written in a way that it easily became a movie in my mind as I read.  Many times books like this have sad endings but the ending to this story is excellent!  I highly recommend this book.	5
This is easily the best game I've ever played.  I played it back when it was first released for the N64 and at the time there was nothing else like it on any of the other platforms. It led the way for 3d gaming which is of course the norm now.  To this day I still get nostalgic and pop the cartridge in on occasion just to run around in the various worlds. The graphics still look pretty good and the game play is still fun.  A simply incredible game.	23
This was on TV all the time to promote Carribean Queen as an 80s classic. I had never heard the song in its entirety, and it clocked in at just above 7 minutes long. Loverboy and Suddenly are also good songs, but not enough for me to rate it higher than a disappointment with the artist as a whole. This is another one of those Cds I found at Wal Mart for 5 bucks. I guess they're still trying to make their money back from the first press. Didn't even include credits, and no lyrics in the package.	9
Holy guacamole, you guys- this amp...I was terrified at first because I plugged in and turned on and had NO SOUND.Took the batteries out and fumed over my foolish purchase, then decided to try once more.Fired it up with my electric kazoo plugged in and WE HAVE LIFT OFF!So rocking.I actually got this for my acoustic-electric ukulele and it sounds beautiful through it. I keep the volume low and the door open about 1&#34; to get a clean-ish tone. Haven't cranked it up yet for that dirty blues sound but I'm sure it'll sound awesome too.	16
I bought a guitar and for a while used the strings that were provided with it.  After a month of using those strings I decided to replace them since I was having trouble keeping the low E string in tune.  I put these strings on and compared to the &#34;default&#34; strings, it was almost silky and softer by comparison.I'm guessing the guitar came with steel strings and these are nickel. The sound was much nicer to my ears as well.  They were relatively inexpensive and made a great choice for replacing the strings on a new guitar.	16
I never could get this game chugging on more than one cylinder.  The manual is irrevelant and no outside game helps are published (I've looked for more than a year).  Play the stockmarket ???  Forget about it ...  If you are not into the esoterica of steam trains or stupid country music,  the computer steals the fun and always has you dead to rights.  Historical trade and industrial patterns are treated very lightly indeed.  I like to able to play the game, but I couldn't make it do anything.	23
I dont need to go into too much detail, as most of the reviews here have covered the plot.  I downloaded this on my kindle app during a horrendous layover at the airport, and it was nice read that kept my interest.  For some reason this book reminds me of Mitch Albom, in the style it was written and the flashbacks.  Looking forward to the movie, as I had envisioned the main character Marlena to look very similar to Reese Witherspoon during my read.  Pictures kept the chapters interesting as well.	5
I purchased this app so that I could listen to my hometown basketball team (pre-season games) while visiting my mother on the other side of the country.  While it linked to the station back home, it didn't play the same programs.  I think the custom local feed, was not used in the link.  This was disappointing.  I ended up watching the play-by-play on NBA.com.When Alaska had an earthquake that triggered tsunami warnings in Hawaii, I didn't find much here in the Hawaii listings.	1
Belkin isn't high in terms of consumer name recognition - but they produce a pretty wide range of products.  Cables to Routers.  I've never been disappointed in any of their products which deliver to value pretty dependably.  This cable is another one of those products.  A simple product (VGA Extension Cord) - but it needs to work reliably.  This cable was nearly the least expensive one available - and it works well / as expected with higher resolution.  I'd buy as many more as needed without any regret or remorse.	10
It was an easy couple of hour read for me that was pleasant enough for a free book.  It's the same old story though, a young couple lose their lives leaving an orphaned child to a rich sibling to take care of.  It was just a bit sad at times all the references to the deceased couple but turned out HEA and the child very much loved. The author has a nice writing style, this is my second book by her and I'll be looking for other free ones.  Enjoy	14
I ordered this as a spare for my original Co-Sleeper. There really aren't a ton of places you can buy these, so I wasn't too concerned about the price. All told, Baby Bungalow did offer it for the best price, including shipping.While the sheet is a perfect fit, I was perplexed by the 'button' holes on the under side of each corner. Can't imagine what those are for. That or my Co-Sleeper is on the older side and there have been design changes since.Overall, quality product.	3
In my opinion, Five Star makes the highest quality, yet still affordable, notebook. The plastic cover is incredibly durable and can withstand a lot of abuse. I find that the spiral spine does bend over time, but it still lasts a while (and a lot longer than some cheaper brands). I like the pockets for holding loose papers on the inside, and the college-ruled paper is less flimsy than other notebooks. There are cheaper products out there, but if you are looking for a notebook that will last, Five Star has you covered.	17
The long odyssey of the remnants of the human race comes gradually to a head in the first part of BSG's final season. The wear and tear is starting to show in both ship and crew. Edgy, gritty as hell and operatic in scope, this sets the bar for outer space SF well into the troposphere. There may never be another series or movie to compare. I look forward to owning the entire series and watching it again, from start to finish. Amazing stuff.That said, I do think the producers are screwing us with this split season approach....	0
My notebook with a bluish-purple cover arrived within several days of placing the order. The price alone for this notebook is good, but when you consider free delivery, it's an even better deal. I always like having spare notebooks around in case I need notebook paper or a student needs paper. The paper is wide ruled for those who like that configuration. Pages aren't perforated for easy removal, but at this price point it can't be expected.This notebook has the SFI, certified sourcing emblem on the cover.	17
Not only is this a very interesting true story about this man, but it is a very motivational story as well. I think of what the Lord can do in my life if he could do it in Don's life. He had been in and out of prison for 17 years, but actually, he was mentally and emotionally imprisoned his entire life until he met Jesus in the hard prison with bars.Not one page of this book bored me. I read every word. I look forward to meeting Don in person one of these days -- in our real home, Heaven.	14
Note: I saw all 12 episodes of Season I in HD via XFinity On Demand.This television series is, thank God, nothing like Gladiator, which depicted Romans carrying weapons in the Senate, which was strictly proscribed, and Romans wearing tattoos, which they despised on account of the barbarian nations they conquered who did wear them. The series does get some historical details right, and there may be facts which have been fudged up. The performances are first-rate, and the costumes and sets have been well-done.Be Warned: Contains graphic violence, female/male nudity & sexuality (in some episodes) and modern/Roman swear words.	0
I love historical novels, and this is one of my favorites. The circus in the Great Depression era is a great setting for the underlying love story. The internal struggles the main characters go through are timeless, and highly resonate with our modern times, perhaps in part because both eras had economic hardship. The book is narrated by a 93 (or 96, as he can't remember his real age) man. His character is very well put together, very real. The book has an optimistic message of triumph over adversity and the value of friendship and true love.	5
I have had acne since childhood and have tried almost every product under the sun to get rid of it. My sensitive skin transitioned to combination and was constantly red from all the products so finally I had had enough. This oil is amazing! A few drops covers my entire face as a moisturizer in the morning or can be blended with a moisturizer for a boost. It is lightweight and doesn't feel oily on.  I have left all my old harsh products behind and am using all natural now. I wish I would have done this years ago!	4
"I chew these E's -- I could swallow them but I like the taste and the feel of these little perles rolling around in my mouth before and after I bite into them.I've been a Twinlab Customer for over 20 years-- they are consistently good, and when I first started using their products, I was drawn to them because of their quality and reputation.These E's are NOT Dl-Alpha (""fake"" Vitamin E) tocopherols -- they are the Real Thing, made with pure, quality-controlled products."	12
I got mine today and was excited to try it out. I went out in my back yard, pulled it from the stuff sack and was left asking myself and promptly found that I was going to need to make a modification because 100&#34; (inches) of rope is nowhere near enough if you are using this hammock for hiking. I swapped the provided 100&#34; of rope with 23' paracord and stainless steel ring a per side. I am now ready to test it out and hopefully it will be good to go.	20
We needed a considerably lengthy 3.5mm Male to Male stereo cable to connect a computer to our phone system, through a3.5mm Mono Female / RCA Male Adaptor, to the system's music on hold. This did the trick, and did it cheaply. The cost of this 25-foot cable is much more reasonable than cables of shorter length. I am very pleased with this. Sound quality was not a major consideration since it only has to play through the speakers of phones. Still, all things considered, I recommend this. What is there to lose at this price?	7
This is a DVD release of an item that Kultur has had in their VHS catalog.  There are reviews of the VHS version, here on this website, which cover the excellent visuals, acting and setting.  So I will only add that the sound has not been improved enough to be satisfactory.  The Gergiev DVD is still the best way for general enjoyment of the opera.  There is a video version under Haitink, which I think is a better performance than the Gergiev, but unfortunately it has not had a commercial release.	6
Measured my front and rear tires.  Front 6/32, rear 8/32.  Time to rotate.Accuracy is cleaverly done by putting the numbers around the barrel so accuracy is increased because numbers are spread apart.  Mechanically simple and small to fit in glove commpartment.Can't imagine any advantage to paying more for such a simple tool when this one works so well.  Quality is medium but more than sufficient for this purpose.  Only a few measurements needed for tires.  This tools is the one to buy.	2
I love this game, I have ever since it came out. The characters are great and classic. Ever since I was young, I have been in love with the Tekken series. Brings back a lot of good memories. I bought this game to bring back the memories and the fun. Though the graphics aren't as top notch at games these days are, but it's still an entertaining game to play. If you collect either Tekken stuff or video games, this is a must own. Don't miss out on this game, before you know it, it will be gone.	23
"Highly recommend for oily skin. Could be a little drying for other skin types, though. I have had excellent results with this product, and I have tried EVERYTHING, both over the counter and prescription. I find this works best during my ""downtime"" from Renova--I take 3-6 months off after an 18-month stretch to give my skin a break. During the down time I use ROC at night and this in the morning. It mimics the dermatologist-prescribed routine I am normally on, just gentler. Be sure to wear at least SPF 15 when using this product!"	4
Perhaps I don't understand the program all that well, but I have used Rob oform for years and can't get along without it.  Unfortunately, it has no Android app.  If I could find a way to import my Roboform passwords, I would like it a lot better.  The thought of having to add 100s of them into a new data base is daunting.  I'm not sure if the resulting KeePass Droid data base is encrypted or not.  Wi-Fi is so vulnerable.	1
"This is the teacher's self-titled album contains more lessons, and upliftment for African-Americans.  DJ Premier's production on ""Rappaz R. N. Dainja"" and ""MC's Act Like They Don't Know"" was are great East Coast hip-hop feel displaying Krs' lyricisim.  ""Ah-Yeah"" displays his consciousness of scociety's problems.  As automatic as his flow on ""De Automatic""  featuring Fat Joe.  ""...stack some money for a video, I don't have any. You're looking at the last emcee with true talent..."" he put it into perspective with ""Build Ya Skillz"".  This release is a presentation of plain hip-hop.  Nothing commercial just ""R.E.A.L.I.T.Y."" through the eyes of Bronx own Krs-One."	9
It is always nice when a product shows up and turns out to be better than you thought.  This is higher quality than I expected for the price.Easy enough to install.  Only issue for me is that the screws go all the way through the wall.  Just barely mind you but never the less.  They are in a spot where nobody will come in contact with the points and I will likely just take the screws out, put a washer in to act a spacer and then there will be no screw points sticking out.	2
"Now I love pc and console role playing games as well as pc shooters.  So when I found out about this game years ago I was in heaven!!!  The game is a great mix of first person shooter, role playing, and horror!  Things come at you from around the corner and the very ship you're on is out to get you!  Awesome!  Since it came out years ago it's able to play on even the lowest spec computer.  Graphics may not be up with today's realistic ""junk"" but who cares this game will scare the crap out of you!!!"	23
Sorry Kindle, but the Nook is my book. I studied the various ereaders and tablets trying to decide what to spend my money on. Loved the idea of an iPad, but $600 is ridiculous for books, and it's size prohibits simple everyday usage. Android tablets seem too fickle and the technology is changing daily, without being upgradeable.So that leaves dedicated ereaders. Kindle was out for two main reasons: proprietary file format prohibits library rentals, and removable battery. The nook just seemed the right set of features.	10
We are blessed that this concert was caught on film. Every song is amazing, and both he and the wailers were on that night. My favorite songs on the set are &quot;Rebel Music&quot;, &quot;War - No More Trouble&quot;, and &quot;The Heathen&quot;. But even the other songs on this set are great. Beware because the version of &quot;The Heathen&quot; is amazing and you will rewind it many times to see it again.  I can't count how much i've played this in the year i've had it. Hopefully it comes out on DVD with bonus features.	6
A decent color e-reader, but pretty much worthless for internet use. The thing will only connect in the B&N store. Apparently it's extremely finicky about the wi-fi hub that it will connect to; meaning most wi-fi hotspots will not work. There's lots of online discussion of this defect in the color's design. I bought mine last summer. And now you have the option of the Kindle Fire. But I've just been reading that some of its new owners are having trouble with wi-fi, too. So, apparently there's no free wi-fi lunch with these relatively inexpensive Android e readers.	10
I have arthritis and degenerative joint problems; part of which affects my right shoulder to the point I can't use free weights anymore and this Xertube Resistance Band fills the bill.  I use it for my P.T. routines as well as general resistance exercises.  They don't last forever; but they do last a long time and do a great job.  The door accessory works well to let you do cable routines just like on the cable machine in the gym (one of my favorites) .  Tones and strengthens without undo stress on the joints.	20
If you can't find a container and add your own sponge, then buy this.Keeping a valuable guitar humidified is essential.I think this item should cost three bucks at most, and $1.50 would still yield a healthy profit!I made some more from stuff from the dollar which I think are better.I use this one for my baritone uke, and the bigger ones I made I use in my dreadnaughts.If you make your own, just make sure to not let the sponge drip, ie, wring it out, and make sure it does not actually touch any bare wood.	16
I have this on my range.  It works great.  Shoot it with 9mm from AR-15 or handgun.  38 special, you name it.  The only issue I had is I can't get it in the ground (it's hard ground).  My solution was to get plastic tupperware tray a few inches deep and fill it with quickcrete.  Then, set this in there.  Now I can move it and it never gets knocked over.  I own a ton of steel targest and I highly recommend this one....	20
This movie, although not my favorite of Jane Austin's work, was still a wonderful movie! Compared to the other Emma adaptation, this one was more historically correct. In the one with Paltrow, some of the costumes looked very ridiculous and some of them you wouldn't wear in the regency era.True to some posts I did feel as if Mr. Knightly was a little hard to get to know, but besides that, I thought all the actors did very well. All in all, this is the best adaptation of Emma so far!	15
I had one of this brush already, but wanted another for outside. I use my inside one to clean tubs and shower tile mainly, and anything else that needs the work of its sturdy bristles. I use the outside one for dirty or mucky shoes, and to clean out our two flat, rectangular bird feeders that hang outside in the weather. If it rains or snows, the feeders get pretty nasty inside on the bottom, but we like them as they allow the birds, squirrels and chipmunks to all be able get into the trays to eat.	12
Hi Folks,this just arrived and while  Amazon.com claims its run  time is  60 minutes its actually 1:30 for the concert  another bit for a couple of  classic TV appearances and another hour for a very cool documentary which is archival quality not something produced recent...so I feel pretty darned happy for my 12 dollar investment indeed!!Whether I would upgrade to blu-ray is debatable....the picture is  not poor but its  of its age and not  something perhaps benefited  by that format...Jump  on this one folks!!!	6
I bought these batteries specifically to go in the outdoor portion of my indoor-outdoor weather monitoring station. I tried normal alkaline batteries first, but they do not provide enough voltage when the temperature is low. Then I tried NiMH rechargeables, but those crap out at an even higher temperature. Then I coughed up the extra money for lithium, i.e. these batteries.These batteries are the only ones that work when it is very cold outside. Lithium wins!These are approximately the cheapest lithium batteries on Amazon, that is how I chose them. And they are a name brand. Go figure.	12
I prefer to install kitchen cabinets more or less by myself...it's patient, exacting work that doesn't lend itself to 'advice over the shoulder'. If I need help, it's intermittent 'help me hoist this'. The T-Jak (along with a wall cleat) makes patient (and safe) upper-cabinet alingment easy for me to do by myself...so I can take the time I need to take to get things perfect. Add a pair of Pony 8510 clamps, some trim-head and cabinet mounting screws, a couple of drill bits and good levels, and it will come out right.	21
This air gauge is dead on accurate, it seals completely, allows air to flow the way it should and the two headed chuck fit all cars, trucks and even those pesky hard to reach motorcycle valve stems. I own three motorcycles and there is nothing more aggravating than trying to fit a chuck in between rotors, fork tubes and tight spaces on a motorcycle. You know what I mean. This two headed angled chuck is angled perfectly to fit over a cycle stem without leaking or having to bend the valve stem. I love it.	2
This paper trimmer looks cheap (the body is gray plastic), but is sturdy and reliable and more than meets all our small office needs. Love the grid that helps you keep the paper straight. If you need more than a few sheets at a time cut, or other features like a spring-loaded arm, you should invest in a more expensive heavy-duty trimmer. But this is more than adequate for us and a welcome addition to our office equipment, as I can't cut a straight line with scissors to save my life!	17
These boxes are the most sturdy I have ever seen in a storage or archive box.  Perfect for storing files that I need to keep but don't need to access often. These would also make great, stackable moving boxes for heavier items such as books and papers.  There are cut-outs for hand-holds, are not awkward or bulky to carry, and assemble quickly and easily.  I especially like the flaps on the lids that cover the hand-hold cutouts on the box.  They keep dust out and protect the contents.	17
The setting is very similar to Downton Abby (if you haven't seen it, you are missing some good stuff) and the plot somewhat as well. There is good dialogue, drama, and a couple of unexpected twists. It takes place around the 1940's pre-World War II.  I agree with others who said the scenery is so well done, colorful and just plain beautiful. If you like BBC, then you won't be disappointed. This is superior historical drama. Enjoy it every night like we have the last few nights. Season 2 is available too.	15
I've only been in broadcasting for 3 years professionally and I have to say, after researching condenser microphones for several months, countless reviews and spec research I can honestly say, this mic compares and indeed exceeds many microphones costing hundreds of dollars more.Here's another interesting fact. I thought the &#34;King of all Media&#34;, Howard Stern would have used some gold plated 10 thousand dollar anniversary rig... well I found out he uses a 990 as well. So, think about it, perfect for the amateur, perfect for the professional... and under 100 dollars? Incredible! You WON'T be disappointed on this buy.	16
"The product I purchased was excellent, and the service and delivery prompt. However, the item was advertised as ""free shipping"", yet when I was billed, I was charged what, in my opinion, was an excessive amount for the handling and mailing. The bill further stated that my order didn't qualify for free shipping (I can't remember the reason; either it was below their minimum or for some other reason).Would I purchase again from this vendor? Yes, but I would clarify the shipping issue before hand."	11
I have tried facial creams priced from 200 dollars to 4.99!  Aveeno is the very best without question.  It hydrates, smooths, lightens dark areas, and is never greasy.  Just try it once ~  you wont regret it!NOTE:  I recently discovered I have a wheat intolerance.  SOME, not all, Aveeno product use wheat and oats.  Even on my skin, I had problems with reactions.  If you do not have wheat issue...  The Aveeno line is excellent in both results and social responsibility.	4
I have to say that I'm really bad at using hand lotion.  I never remember to put in on, even in the winter.  The only time I remember is after my hands are already red and cracked.  I came across this stuff a couple winters ago when my hands were in really bad shape.  After the first use, my hands were moisturized and no longer cracked.  What is also great about it is that it lasts through handwashing.  I use this once in the morning and it usually lasts the entire day. Great, great, great product.	4
First, I like the color blue so this works for me.  It is light, portable and made with with a kind of plastic coating that helps it to be much more durable than just heavy paper.  The fold-over flap is large enough to allow the file to expand and still be closed.In a day when paper is becoming less important, it is still helpful to have a small file like this to help you carry valuable papers with you or for storage.  Obviously, you may also put thumb drives and other electronic storage devices in it for storage.It works!	17
I used to have these along time ago.  When I first got them, they were better than my other headphones I used to own.  These headphones have some serious bass and treble, and DJ's still use these headphones.  They are great for part 15 broadcasting, and hosting holiday parties when queing up a song.  They are good for remixing, shuffling music, and running a small FM or AM station.  Also these headphones are good for the shortwave radio listener and ham radio operator.  They are the best!  I hope I can get another pair soon.	10
These are good in a pinch, especially since they don't need milk, which I always seem to be out of (no little ones at home). Although the other Betty Crocker mashed potatoes that do require milk has a better texture and fluff up better, with these you just need to watch the amount of water, or they'll end up too thin. They have a slight butter taste without that fake butter taste. Serve them up plain, with butter, with gravy, or any other way.Now, I'm off to order more...	11
The historical story was interesting and kept my attention, even though I think TOO MANY people here are giving Ms. Gruen too much credit.  Personally, I don't think she used enough historical fact and instead relied on a very formulaic plot-line that was very predictable, i.e. the love relationship, the MC and head of the animals will be foiled in the end, and the preposterous ending where our dear wonderful elephant kills the cruel animal director.  Too contrived for me.I can understand the popularity of this book.  I cannot understand why it's a runaway bestseller.	5
I have been using this mask for about 30 years now ..... If you have acne breakout this is a good product and it doesn't cost a fortune...I have tried other masks but keep coming back to this one.......my skin is no longer problematic ....my friends now  cant believe how great my skin is ......when I tell them my ups and downs with hormonal acne...thanks !!! queen helene!!!  I have no scars !!! I just found out amazon carries this product at such a great price!!!	4
Of course my dog hardly likes any dry foods. But he really resists eating this as long as he can. Holistic Select is one of the best brands out there. I can't recommend it enough if your dog has digestive problems. It's the first food that got his stools to be usually pretty normal. But with this flavor, his poops seem rather soft again. Can't say for sure that it's this food. Also, Taste of the Wild is excellent. I think he likes it a bit more than Holistic Select. Holistic's canned food is awesome. He even loves it.	19
"Right and wrong are not always obvious. ""Vengeance"" follows Owen Dunham, who is investigating the trail of a figure who is called the 'Grudge Ninja'. With little lead on the Ninja's motives, he is shocked when he does start to learn of the truths, and begins to doubt the integrity of his lead. The Grudge Ninja's methods may be wrong, but could its mission be right? ""Vengeance"" is a thriller that dwells in shades of gray with many different characters with different motives and codes, highly recommended."	14
It's not sharp enough to do any serious chopping, and not very ergonomic for that purpose either.  But if you already have it out for another reason, give it a shot and see if it works well enough to avoid dirtying up a knife.  I use it for scraping and pastry work, and it works fabulous for both of those purposes.  I downgraded it a star because the handle is thicker than it needs to be and takes up unnecessary space in the drawer.  A thinner handle would make it 5 stars for me.	13
Other reviewers have covered this title's strengths and weaknesses pretty well already, so I'll just summarize my experience with the game:Strengths:- If you liked Military Madness on the the Turbografx-16, you're in for some nostalgic fun- The units, the game play, it's all just like you remembered it, as far as I've seenWeaknesses:- The AI is weak, and the difficulty (particularly if you played the original game) is fairly lowDespite the weak AI, I'm enjoying playing through it so far.  It is sort of a bummer that it's not available for the Fire, though.	1
I love good caper shows, but the casting is almost a total disaster. Timothy Hutton, the black guy and the blond girl are not terribly engaging, likeable or compelling. The black guy, in particular, is utterly unconvincing as the stereotypical black computer superwhiz, and utterly annoying and bland otherwise, sleepwalking through the series. Timothy Hutton has a grandma vibe. But the tough guy is a good pick.I realize dissenting reviews of TV series are the kiss of death for a reviewer, but I have to be honest.	0
"I needed a remote line for use on my pellet rifles when using an external CO2 paintball tank (instead of small powerlets).This fit the bill perfectly as I was able to remove the paintball fittings on the remote end and use the standard 1/8"" NPT fitting as found and ndeeded on my pellet rifle.The hose is a bit stiff and short, but stretching it out overnight to 12' helped ""memorize"" the hose to a longer length.All in all, nothing wrong with this at all...it was exactly what I needed."	20
For every soil sample I tested this powder with, it indicated it was 7.5 ph.  I even tried some of my almost pure peat mix in it and it said it was 7.5, which is the highest the meter will go so I'm assuming it's just bad powder.  I tested the same soil in the other compartment with my liquid ph tester (also bought on here, good stuff), and it showed the real PH values (5.0 for my peat mix), 6.5 for my other regular soil.  So it gets to keep a star because I'll use the container for testing with my liquid ph tester.	18
Still looking for the 'dimmable' option--only found the on/off switch. But essentially the same light as the 'table' model, very bright yet only 3W used. Has a clamp instead of a weighted base, capable of attaching to a table or headboard no larger than 1 and 1/4 in thick. Only assembly req'd was plugging cord into plug. Same perfect black paint as table model, but cannot change bulb--permanent, so must toss entire unit if it ever burns out! Advertised @ 20K hours! We'll see...&#128521;	21
The password generator is nice, especially with the options it gives.It really needs a bit better up-front documentation on the way it works as far as locking and such.My biggest concern is the permissions. I am fairly sure it's safe, and I understand why it is asking for them, but I cannot condone using any app which holds sensitive data to request any permission allowing network access and things which 'could' be used maliciously.Cool features, but not going to use anything but the generator.	1
Just like other animal repellants (and I've tried many), the Havahart repellant (Havahart also make traps) fails to deliver.The battery operated sprayer is a toy, so good luck getting it to work reliably.The odor is similar to other products. In fact, you can make your own with rotten egg and hot pepper.But to focus on the core objective: repelling critters -- I did not see any noticeable drop in the amount my flowers and vegetables. Deer, squirrels and rabbits seem minimally discouraged.	18
Like most new Rush CDs, I had to listen to this several times before I could form an opinion.  This is a good Rush disc.  The music sounds great & there are many good songs.  Geddy's voice sounds more mature.  However, his vocals sound tired; that is the only way I can describe them.  While I am always happy to get new Rush material, I can't really point to a specific song/highlight on the disc.  There is just something about this disc that disappoints.  I can't put my finger on it.	6
This is a fairly simple game. Get the ninja who is jumping from two buildings as high as you can while evading obstacles such as birds flying down, squirrels on clothing lines and other ninjas. When you collect 3 of a kind, like 3 birds or sqirrels, you can get a power jump. I think that it is an okay game to play. I would rate it as average in my opinion. I would still recommend this app to any gaming fans or anyone looking to fill their devices with games.	1
I got this as a shower gift but could not use it for awhile. The handle is kinda big and the chewing surface kinda wide. It also takes a lot of force to get it to vibrate and that took a while for my daugher to figure out, at first I had to hold down one of the corners for her while she chewed on the other. Once she got a little bigger it was a much better toy for her. But don't get me wrong she loved it when she was itty bitty she just needed a little help from mommy.	3
Like too many shows, there's a good hook, then the show is not renewed.  I would have liked to see at least one more season (assuming the writers could maintain the intensity & plot).  The season reached a point with some openings for a second season.This is definitely sci-fi, but not &#34;space aliens&#34;, invasions by bugs, or other crap like that.  It's sci-fi enough to be beyond our world experiences, but not so far as to be incredulous.I enjoyed every episode.	0
I think Munchkin is a great game, BUT its not serious AT ALL, and if you go into the game wanting something serious and challenging, then you are going to be disappointed.  HOWEVER, if you want a zany game where you get to screw over your friends and kill ridiculous monsters, armed with even more ridiculous equipment, then this is the game for you.  Like many other games, this game is largely based on luck, so if you draw badly, the game can seem nearly impossible, but if you draw well, then you can coast to victory.	22
Yes, much of this story (as with others in the Hot Zone series) is superficial and silly - old fashioned letter writing, suddenly falling in love with the computer geek from work, the entire scene at the male strip club, etc. But, that's kind of the fun of these stories. Personally, I'm a sucker for a hot military hero or cowboy romance, and Male Call (despite the awful pun) reeled me in. For an hour or so worth of reading, this story is definitely enjoyable.	14
Kudos to RareFlixNClassic for reliable and expedeiant service, ordered (03 March 2010) same time as other products. I recieved this one 9 March 2010 and as of 10 March 2010 Amazon still has not shipped the other iteams oreder with this one. All with the super saver shipping including this one. Quick shipping. Recieved product as advetised in new condition. The movie it self is a classic anti culture movie ot its time. I like the movie for what it is and you get to see Nickolsen from his earlyer years in the buissness.	15
These stockings by Leg Avenue are indeed very nice.  For the purposes of full disclosure I will admit that I initially bought them to wear with a (I was a nineteenth century Parisian courtesan!) costume.  However, since then, I have found that they also work great for everyday use.  I have worn them to work and also for more formal events.  My beautiful stockings have not let me down yet!  Great price, perfect fit!  What more can a modern woman ask for?	8
This has become a must read with so many favorable reviews I kept looking forward to being captured by it.  It really is two stories in one book.  The old man's story is wonderful.  My father resides in a residency care facility and the insights of the old man made me think about what my father is facing.  The loss of dignity and the battling soul struck home.In my view the main story was only fair.  The story seemed to be telegraphed and I could not get my self terribly interested.	5
"I saw reviews for this product saying it wasn't Motorola etc. but mine definitely was. Yes it came in bulk packaging but it had all the paperwork and warranty information. I guess those users must have ordered from a different vendor. It is engraved along the front with ""Motorola"" and has the M on the round part.As for functionality, I've noticed that this charges my HTC Incredible 2 very fast in my car and the blue light matches the accents in my Mazda6! Love this little guy and it's a great price!"	7
I own the Original California Car Duster and it works very well.  It is great for touch up cleaning in between car washes.  It is true what they say about the more you use it the better it cleans.  If you use it a lot it will start to turn black but it will start cleaning better than ever.  It is great to wipe light dirt and dust off your car and makes it look like you just waxed your car.  If you take care of it then it should last for many years.	2
Ordered a set of these based on the almost unanimous 5 star reviews. Packages came with the dreaded &#34;Made in China&#34; sticker applied to the box. Sure enough, all 4 were mis-welded so badly that they would not fit a 2x4 into the top. Every single one had the top bracket at all sorts of random angles so they were nowhere near parallel. One had a gap of &#60;1&#34; where you insert the 2x4.No quality control. Another quality brand down. If someone knows of a good alternative, please post it.	21
I spent pretty much a whole mounth of my life just playin this game and i dont regret it. This game is just so intence it pretty much starts to rub off on you a lil bit. THe story is very deep and even change a lil depending on how you play the game. Alas they're are people who should never play this game ever. I like to call these people morons because all they can do while playing this is complain about the graphics. People need to look beyond graphics to see weather are not its worth playing.	23
This is a well-made adaptation of Thackeray's Victorian drama - sumptious sets and costumes, good acting, high production values.  This was produced and written by the people behind Pride &amp; Prejudice - and while I  enjoyed this - it certainly does not compare to P&amp;P.  Natasha Little is  splendid as Becky Sharp though I was disappointed that the actress who  played Amelia Sedley wasn't &quot;pretty enough&quot; and the film's plot  does tend to &quot;jump around&quot; a bit.  If you're looking for a more  satisfying, enjoyable Victorian drama, check out &quot;Middlemarch&quot;  (starring Rufus Sewell and Juliet Aubrey) or &quot;Great Expectations&quot;  (starring Ioan Gruffud) instead.	15
This product does its job: Which is to protect the Palm. (They can, and do, break, you know, if you drop them without protection).The strap holds the Palm in the case securely, as does the ingenious snap-in docking mechanism. There are slots for two or three credit cards and a side slot for some cash. But this only works as a wallet in a pinch.On the down side, the case does roughly double the depth of the Palm Vx, but the way I see it, that's the price of protection.	10
We have two lab mixes. The youngest is still very much in puppy stage and boy does he love to chew! We had given him rawhides to keep his focus on something appropriate to chew, but he was going through too many rawhides. I saw nylabones in petsmart in the heavy chewers section. The first plain bone went over well. So I ordered more on Amazon. I'm so glad I did! These were the best solution to keep our chewer occupied! He loves all the different shapes and flavor toys that they have! Thank goodness for nylabones!	19
So much better than the Rebel X!  It it lightweight, takes fabulous pictures, and looks good to boot!  Having used my mom's Rebel X for years, I finally bought the 2000 in September of 2002.  I love the fact of having it!  In the bag, it doesn't break my shoulders like the X did, and takes beautiful photos.  I am into SLR, however, my first digital will be a Minolta DiMage 7i (non-SLR).  I *will* be keeping this one, though, for the long distance shots with the other lense I have for it and teleconverter.  Worth having for anybody!	10
The teether just arrived for my ten month old who seems to be cutting his second tooth.He's already figured out how to activate the vibration.  It is soft, yet has some ridges and bumps that he is pulling with his teeth and gums.  I think baby gives it 5 stars!!!There were contradictory reviews on whether the batteries were replaceable or not- the packing says they are NOT.  So unless whoever said they were replaceable is just handier than the rest of us, they do not appear to be replaceable.	3
Occasionally I watch a gross-out horror movie, if I like the actor and it has high reviews. I tend to forget that the high reviews always come from horror fans.And I have yet to see such a movie that was really good by ordinary film standards. This is no exception. Basically the story and logic is sacrificed for cheap horror effects, like maggot-eaten faces.The one good thing about it is Jennifer Connelly, who even at this tender age was the prettiest thing on two legs.	15
I've been very happy with this scrapper.It's worth knowing that unlike many scrapers this one relies on being sharp instead of being thin and flexible to scrape.  I'm not sure if I find this to be an advantage or a disadvantage.  It makes it a more multi-functional product for sure; however, I think it might slightly compromise the dough-scrapping-from-counter flagship role.  I'm certainly not going to try and find a different scraper, just thought the difference was worth mentioning.The markings on the blade are very helpful and the nice thick handle makes it easy to use.	13
I have loved this movie ever since I was a kid. I watched it every year, even though I had a copy I taped off of tv. I knew that I HAD to get the dvd. I had never seen it in widescreen and, now that I have, it's full of 80s goodness. A bit sad (if you've seen it, you'll know what I mean), but it has an incredibly tear-jerk ending. A great movie for the whole family, though maybe not the littlest ones. If you have any sort of Christmas spirit in you, you have to pick this movie up.	15
I LOVE this spreader - I bought one to try it out, despite some negative reviews.  I thought, it's only $5, I'll try it.I haven't had any of the problems that others have stated.  I don't take it apart for cleaning, and I haven't seen any rust spots.  I just throw mine in the dishwasher.After using spreaders from Pampered Chef, I much prefer the Oxo spreader, as it's much stiffer & able to scoop better.  Very useful for peanut butter, cheese spreads, cream cheese, etc.  I like it so much, I'm ordering more.	13
"This album is so hauntingly beautiful.  It reminds me of how the Celts and Druids would endow trees with human and other life characteristics.  Now...every time I prune a tree I expect it to say ""ouch!"", or when I walk by a tree I expect it to reach out to me.  Listening to this album, especially after consuming a quart or more of good Irish whiskey is a delight.  I remember trees and I am sure, after listening to this album, that they remember me also.  Definitely a buy!  Cuckoo ForCeltic"	6
You open your Braun cleaning station, slide out the old cartridge and slide in one of these.  Next time you dock/charge your razor, it's cleaning like new. Holy crap batman! Amazing.I wish these were a bit cheaper.  Seriously.  $20 for 4 plastic containers manufactured by children in China, filled with alcohol, coloring, and some other solvent.  It actually seems like a waste. Why not just sell big bottles with the cleaner that we could pour into the container that comes with the razor?	12
Its chutes and ladders, it should be simple fun. You spin the spinner move your spaces, hit a ladder, go up, hit a chute, come down. There are a lot of fun pictures on the game board, however, it makes it hard to see the numbers, or the directional arrows.As this game is supposed to be for the super young this becomes a big frustration. The standee pieces are cardboard which is fine but after playing a few games the bottoms or our characters are fraying.They made it cheap to be affordable, so you get what you pay for here.	22
YOU HAVE TO HERE THESE TO BELIEVE IT.  I WENT TO A BIG ELECTRONICS PLACE WHERE I LIVE AND THEY HAVE ALOT OF HEADPHONES ON DISPLAY AND I MEAN ALOT, I BROUGHT A CD PLAYER IN WITH ME AND THE KOSS HEADPHONES TO COMPARE, I TRIED SOME THAT WERE $100 OR MORE AND THEY DID NOT SOUND AS GOOD OR BETTER THAN THESE. AND WHEN THE FOAM PADDING WEARS OUT, YOU CAN REPLACE THEM, WHICH YOU CAN NOT ON THE EXPENSIVE ONES, YOU CAN GET THE FOAM PADS THROUGH AMAZON ALSO	10
LOVE IT LOVE  LOVE IT. read concerns about the structural build of the stitching on the bag to rope interface. Ignore them, the bag is well built for it's intended use. Just fill it with sand, rocks, or weights and make sure you pick it up from the bottom of the bag, not the rope! And you should be O.K. But if you toss it from the rope just remember you are inducing more force onto the stitching interface due to the mass x acceleration of the swinging action. Play it safe and take care of your anchor:) enjoy	20
If you are looking for the Reeboks that were made in the 80's and 90's, this is not it.  The first pair I ordered in the size I have worn for decades was too short and way too tight thru the toe area.  Ordered a half a size larger and they were still tight thru the toe area and the heel area is too large, but the length was right.  I had to use inserts in the heels and put them in a stretcher to make the toe area comfortable.  Will not be ordering these shoes anymore.	8
Ok, maybe it's not quite as lofty as Scrabble, but this is one timeless and very fun game.It can be played with two people or more, has no set time limit or set finish point.  It is played by all players at once, no taking turns like in some games where everyone else has to sit around and wait.  Everyone plays off the same set of letters, so there is no difference in players chances for getting a good score, it's all skill.This is one of my very favorite games.  Highly recommended.	22
simply the best.  great story, great graphics, great control, great replay value.  it is true, n64 wasnt that great of a system, with pretty horrible games.  i bought it back in 98 and up until i got my ps2 i only bought a few games for it,  Zelda: ocarina, Zelda: Majora, Goldeneye, Perfect Dark, and DK64.  There may be other good games but this game is by far the best, not just on n64  but possibly out of all video games ever.  trust me people, if i say it is good, it is good.  I dont give out good reviews very easily.	23
These strings are good. Nice tone, last a decent amount of time, and they're cheap. Color coded ball-ends make it easy to string without having to pay much attention. I use these on all my electric guitars now, where before I used Dean Markley 11-52 (mostly Les Paul scale) - I moved to these when I got a strat-scale guitar. I don't remember why I picked these, other than they are cheap and readily available everywhere, where Dean Markley can be hit or miss.	16
I don't play tennis.  I can't comment on how these would be on the court.  I bought them to be used in a hand held ball-chucker that I also bought on Amazon.  They fit in the chucker just as nicely as the one that originally came with it (different color, though).  I CAN for sure say that my dog loves to retrieve them!  I asked him if he had any comment but he just looked at me so I guess that means he agrees.  Enjoy!	20
I got a chance to see Julia live in 1994, and the concert she gave still  ranks in my all time top 10 that I have been at. This is the CD that got me  started with Julia. I was familiar with Happy Ever After from the video,  but Porcelain is much better than her first release. I think that  Porcelain, Falling Forward and East-West are all pretty damn good and rate  5 stars each.  She got a lot more air play and video play 10 years ago. I  wonder why she fell out of favor with VH1?	9
I can't fight this feeling anymore.  Time for another quick Argento review.This movie rules!  A pretty straight forward slasher/giallo from the master.  The plot is simple, the kills are unique and well-orchestrated.  And bloody.  Just some high impact violence that won't leave you any scars.  If you liked Bird with the Crystal Plumage, you'll love this.Dario, I'm gonna keep on loving you.  It's the only thing I wanna do.  I don't wanna sleep, I just wanna keep on--okay I'll stop.  I believe it's time for me to fly...	15
This is not a teaching; this is an act as in action. The film's base on the Stations of the Cross; creates a Passion Play of great power. It's as close to a time machine as you might get; being plunged into another time zone. Sweet and rougher than usual; it's a great film to see. More horrific also; but redemptive.Blu-ray shows the great design and photography; as well as a powerful soundtrack. Two versions and chapters that reflect the stations, plus a DVD	15
"Yep, flat diapers are indispensible for baby.  But skip the Gerbers!I'd decided to cloth diaper, and got some fantastic (big, thick, soft) birdseye flats for $12 per dozen, online (Google flat diapers).At the shower I was given some of these, and I thought ""cool, some cheapies for the non-diapering situations.""I was shocked to find they're not that cheap, and even more shocked at the (lack of) quality.  After 5 weeks, these are still sitting untouched on the shelf, even though my tendency to grab my ""diapering diapers"" for everything has me running short on diapers a lot!"	3
Seems to work well.  Like the other reviewers said, you could probably pay 150 more and get the same thing.  solid construction.  getting used to the attachment.  It will never stand in the position like in the photo.  There's no resistance on that joint so it flops down.  Just place it upside down.  Record using a headset or you'll get too much feedback.  Just ordered a shorter stand.  Hope that it works with that joint that makes it stand head down.	16
I love this boost pedal so much!  I owned the MXR Micro Amp for a while, but I found that it colored my tone way too much (too much low end).  The MC401 on the other hand doesn't color your tone at all.  It provides a very precise boost and pushes your tube amp into natural overdrive.  The boost is extremely articulate and produces throbbing palm muting and clear chords. If you're in the market for a boost or a buffer, I'd look no further.  This pedal is affordable, sturdy, and sounds absolutely amazing!	16
That Jimmy is slow and uninterested in releasing this on DVD (as well as Tales from Margaritaville) says a lot about how little he cares about his fans.  In fact, most of his earlier albums greatly need remastering, and although he earns millions of dollars a year, he doesn't bother to do anything about this.  It's a shame that most fans don't see this, and Jimmy doesn't either.  Blind worship?As far as the concert goes, it's fairly good.  It does suffer some though from the time period (fluff songs like If the Phone Doesn't Ring It's Me, etc) and low lighting.	6
My favorite dish brush.  When the price took a big dip I bought several.  They will last a long time too if you don't use it on hot pans and store with bristles up or not resting on anything that flattens them.  Run through the dishwasher monthly or sooner.  The large diameter handle fits my XL hand well.  If the price is around $5 - 7 jump at $10 no way?  But if ten is nothing then go for it.  I have not found anything better.	13
Probably my favourite Sinatra's album. Released in 1956. Arrangements are done by Nelson Riddle and songs are fabulous. Here you can hear such great songs like on of his biggest hit, Cole Porter's I've Got You Under My Skin, Gershwin brothers' Love Is Here To Stay,...Pennies From Heaven was a big hit for Louis Prima, Anything Goes (another Porter's composition) for Ella Fitzgerald,...This is one of his best albums (and not only for Capitol Records).So, lay down and enjoy this fabulous set.	9
My daughter began playing this game at age 6.  She will now play it with anyone who offers!  It is challenging and fun for adults as well.  The only downsides are that you need a fairly large, flat surface to create the tile patterns, and you need to be prepared to play for 30 minutes or more in order to finish a full game.  If you bump the table and jar the tiles, it can really lead to chaos if the game is fairly far-along.  Overall, however, I highly recommend it, even for adults.	22
I bought this blu ray set last year before realizing that there were exclusive performances and featurettes on different versions from Amazon and Target. The packaging is clever, but I would have preferred a standard blu ray case.I ended up selling it and getting the blu ray from amazon.co.uk. It comes in a standard blu ray case and features all 6 of the extra performances and 7 extra featurettes from Amazon and Target. The blu ray is region free and plays fine in us blu ray players. It is currently around $20. Definitely the way to go to get everything.http://www.amazon.co.uk/Woodstock-Blu-ray-Jimi-Hendrix/dp/B001V7P2MM/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&s;=dvd&qid;=1274286271&sr;=8-1	6
I have mixed feelings about these batteries.  They take a good charge and hold it better than my Duracell rechargebles, but still lose about 10% overnight.  I use them to power a one-LED night light outdoors.  It keeps it bright for at least three nights if I remember to turn it off during the day.  One of the four batteries is a little loosey-goosey.  Sometimes it only charges about 75%, though another recharge cycle will restore it to full again.  Considering other reviewers' comments about funky batteries, maybe they should tighten their quality control.	12
This sprayer required no real assembly, batteries are included.I went out in the back yard to spray these huge hostas that the deer have been feasting on.The spray was easy and smooth and even after a week with a light rain 2 days after I sprayed there are no new chomp marks.  So other than it would be nice to have a refill to use in the sprayer, since it continues to work, since it seems a waste to keep buying a sprayer I'm very happy with this product.	18
I didn't even know a product like this existed until it popped up one day on Amazon. I didn't really know what I was going to use it for, but I wanted to give the idea a try. It turns out that now my thigh-high stockings stay up, and oh my gosh- even my below-ankle socks stay on all day! I didn't think that was possible! It's a lot more tricky to get a shirt or a bra-strap to stay up depending on the material and thickness, but it's possible. I love this product.	4
I got this for my teeting German Shepherd puppy, and it's great for that.  She's not a super strong chewer yet.  But, I have to be careful that my adult Shepherd doesn't get a hold of it because she is a much stronger chewer  and can tear chunks of this loose.Then the puppy comes along and eats those chunks, and then she throws up.So, to review, good for puppies/dogs who are not strong chewers.  BAD for strong chewers.  Swallowing small bits of this = no big deal.  Swallowing big chuck of this = messy clean up (or potential other health problems).	19
This is a nice watch and I decided to keep it, even though it is a different color than what is stated in the description.  I expected a black strap, but it is actually a very dark brown.  I could understand how someone might mistake it for black, someone who may not pay that close attention to colors.  But those of us who do will immediately recognize it as a dark brown.  It's still an attractive and useful watch, so I decided to keep it anyway.	8
I admit, I was turned off at first by the size and shape, but was easily won over by the quality of the sound and the comfort. This is as good as bluetooth gets.The downsides are the rediculously small buttons for power and volume, which are almost unusable for most, but fine for me.Today I thought I lost my headset. I found it in a parking lot, ran over at least once, in the rain for at least 12 hours. 10 minutes under a hair drier and it was working again! I will buy another when the time comes.	7
I love this app! It combines two essential tools for me. I use the food diary and database many times during the day.it helps both be aware of my intake AND keep me honest!  The calories guide works with my  Fitbit to help me balance my diet with my exercise.So far I've lost 16 pounds and am encouraged to continue.  By this time in every other diet plan I've tried I would have given up. Well worthwhile and works on PC, smartphone, android and Kindle Fire.	1
The RIO rocks! It is so great that Diamond Multimedia prevailed in their fight against the forces of pure evil in the music industry and allowed us, the public, to have the RIO! This little baby holds your MP3's and plays  them with outrageous quality and no moving parts! You simply cannot make  the music &quot;skip&quot;. Take it jogging, bob sledding, whatever! The  Rio is cute and compact, battery lasts forever, runs great and is really  simple to use. Works well with the PC linkup, etc. A hot item!	10
Ok, here's the thing with this show..everyone in it is excellent..I meaneveryone..the story line is fine and the writing good for the set up.I love the parents and always have but the show falls short of evergetting in the least little bit close to what it could be..I don't know whyit's a disappointment but it is..it's got all this gold and for some reasonit's been cast in lead.  Bummer man, because I would really like to watchthese people..and believe me I have tried more than once.	0
I like that I can do others stuff while listening to a book. Great app very intuitive, stop and pick up where you left off. I have not tried the listen to and then switch over to reading in the kindle app where you left off listening in the audible app, but I believe since they are sister apps why would they not work flawlessly? I like some of the books offered in the audible selection, there is enough audible books to keep my attention. I like that they offer daily specials at deep discounts!	1
Our stapler was always disappearing - we have 2 kids - so seeing this available was a chance to just maybe get our main stapler to stay by the phone where we try to keep it. This is clearly an economy model - very low price - and as expected it is made of plastic and does not feel very solid compared to business class staplers. But, from the kid's perspective mainly just stapling a few sheets of paper together it works great.Overall, recommended for light duty / stapling homework assignments, etc.	17
. . .i was Quite amused by potter's indignance at realizing that veron was using her to break into films. maybe that fatuous, indulgence-accustomed artiste potter wouldn'ta got caught so laughably off-guard had she taken a  more realisitic page from camille paglia: &quot;in western society, there  are no non-exploitative relationships&quot; :) but whutthehell, a fantasy's  a fantasy, and if she can dress it up nice &amp; sell it (and for the most  part she could, except the notion that this veron could actually be  interested in her That Way), i'll buy :)	15
"This item would have gotten 5 stars if two things had been done...1. You have to buy your own quick-connect (3/8"" - BEWARE).2. The pressure regulator is a plastic unit and seems to me that it will break soon.  It's positioned such that it is easily knocked.Other than those two caveats, it's a great compressor.  Not too loud, and it will power a framing nailer, no problem (yesterday, I installed 100 fence pickets in a couple of hours, six nails per picket in rapid succession, and it had no problem keeping up).Will work well for a homeowner that will use it occasionally."	21
"When you meet this group of genius nerds, you will be hooked on The Big Bang Theory!  Dr. Sheldon Cooper is played BRILLIANTLY (excuse the pun) by Jim Parsons and has more quirks than a hedgehog has spikes (but he's not crazy, ""his mom had him tested!"")  Penny (their ""normal"" neighbor) is adorable and charming and has the patience of a saint while putting up with her very strange group of friends.  This is an intelligently written sit-com.  I highly recommend this series!"	0
"An evergreen animated fantasy based on J.M. Barrie's beloved children's book, Disney's ""Peter Pan"" features dazzling hand-drawn visuals, excellent voice acting, and a winning score epitomized by the song ""You Can Fly!"" Rendered by Driscoll, Peter is refreshingly cocky, and even Tinkerbell has a bit of an impetuous streak; Hook, of course, is as dastardly as ever. Made by the same team that later created ""The Lady and the Tramp,"" this thrilling, imaginative tale bests the 1923 live-action original, and leaves most other versions in the (fairy) dust as well."	6
These tab dividers are neat and very professional looking. I used them for paper-filing of tax returns this year. Nice to be able to organize different tax forms and associated documents (copies of receipts etc) using these tab dividers. The different colored sets also make it easy to categorize. The tabs are made of paper material so you can write on them. The only thing I would have liked is label stickers on a separate sheet on which you can possibly print and paste to the tabs - just like address labels.Overall, neat set of tabs.	17
It reads like one of the weakest books in the WoT series.  So much useless detail that does not move the plot forward.  Remember when you had a paper that was due in two weeks and you tried and tried to write something and couldn't come up with anything.  But you put in enough filler that if changed the spacing to 1.5 and picked a different font you would get your minimum 10 pages, 8 of which was just restating the question ?  Yeah that paper is pretty much this book.	5
When researching what to do to make my car paint smooth as glass, I found this clay kit.  Works wonders, especially on weathered finishes.  Test your paint surface for roughness (everyone's has some) by putting your hand in a plastic baggie and wipe it over your car paint.  If it feels rough, which it should, then Meguiar's Clay Detailer is the cure!  Using the spray as a lubricant, the clay is rubbed along the paint surface removing bonded contaminants which cannot be removed by washing alone (tar, etc.).  I love it!	2
If I had to freeze breastmilk, this was great because I didn't have to put a lot of plastic containers in the freezer (we could use them to feed the baby instead).  They were easy to dispose of if they outdated (there is a place to label them with the date).  I usually put 3 of them in a freezer bag as a double layer of protection against leaks and freezer burn.  None ever leaked for me.  They thaw easier and faster than in hard plastic or glass containers, too.  Very convenient.	3
"It's been a long, cold winter here in the Northeast and I needed to add a couple of more thermal undershipts to my wardrobe.There are more expensive brands than Carhart and maybe they are more ""fashionable"". However, when it comes to keeping me warm and lasting for years, I've never found a better brand.If I do have one minor complaint it's that the sleeves are too long. Granted, I'm only 5'8"", but the sleeves are long enough for guys playing in the NBA."	8
ALlllright, so I broke his tailbone somehow and needs a Donut Cushion.Pro: it fits fine, inflate easily, you can spot it from miles away since it's bright red, helps relieve my tailbone while sitting. A great conversation starter.Con: it STINKS of rubber, I've cleaned it, aired it, used it for almost 1 month now and it's still stinky. You can spot it from miles away since it's bright red.If you don't mind the cons, get it.	12
I don't speak ancient aramaic, and I'm probably being uncool to admit that I hate to read subtitles.  But my problem with this film is the violence.  I think it's way too much, and really bruises the viewers unneccessarily.  I understand that part of the Christian experience is to understand the sacrifice and pain, but I felt like I was watching a Tobe Hooper Chainsaw massacre at times.  For the violence, I give the film 1-star and WARN PARENTS before scarring their children.  For Gibson's good intentions, I give the film 5-stars.  It averages to 3 stars.	15
I use to love the Dictionary.com app. Now, I tolerate it. The most recent version tries to predict what word I'm looking up, and it's nearly always wrong. Sometimes when typing in a word, it will display a drop-down menu with a list of possible words. My word will be in the list and I will click on it, but at least a third of the time, it doesn't know the word. How can the word be in your drop-down list, but you don't have a definition for it?	1
I had one of these decades ago when I blow dryed my hair and used hot rollers -- I thought the towel was great.  I recently bought another, as my hair is very long and naturally curly (it has to air dry).  First of all, this towel will not stay twisted in a turban while I put on moisturizer, etc., and second, it soaks up so much moisture that my hair dries frizzy (even with product on it).  I'm dissappointed with my purchase, and would not recommend this to anyone with naturally curly hair that need to be air dried.	4
I brought a pair of aqua sphere goggles and they work great, they did not fog up like the rest of the goggles do and the seal works great and stay seal so it does not leak. I have brought other pairs of goggles from speedos to tyr and they all leak and fog up even when they say its anti fog and they do not seal well around my face. I aways buy aqua spheres now and no other brands of goggles. they are also easy to ajust. I would highly recamend these goggles to anyone they are great.	20

Installed one on my CF Martin, almost leaving a thumb super-glued to the inside of the guitar. An interesting experience - would have been almost comical to arrive in the emergency room with my thumb stuck to the inside of the guitar. I'm sure that some of my DNA still resides in the guitar.Bought another for my brand new Taylor GS Mini Mahogany after hearing what a great acoustic sound was coming from the CF Martin through a brand new Kustom Sienna Pro30 acoustic guitar amp from Amazon. I've read that folks prefer the K&K; over the made-for-the-GS-Mini-Taylor-pickup.Get it.	16
I have spent a great deal of money on tights recently, and these are by far the best.  They don't run, rip or snag if you handle them properly. They look good. I wear them in place of stockings with business clothes and they look good, feel good. There is some compression so it's a nice supportive feel and slenderizing.  The nude really is a nude color. Pink is nice with pink shoes. I will be buying more now that I know they work. LIght weight enough for warm weather.	8
If you got the Mother's Powerball then this is the product to use.  I'm no expert in detailing but i got my Car as proof and finish product for this very nice Wax.  It's very shiny and very glossy.  It's even better when i first take my car out from the dealership.  I just hope this wax last longer than Carnauba.  I would highly recommend this product if you havent tried it yet.  Just make sure you dont wax the black sides of the car and if you do, wipe it so it wont leave a white residue.	2
When my daughter outgrew her infant tub, we went through a few different devices to try to give her a safe bath. She is VERY active so she doesn't like to sit for very long. We first tried the bath ring, that was a disaster. This snug tub has worked wonderfully. She is able to stand in it and splash around without us worrying about her breaking her head if she slips. It's very safe and fits snugly in our shower. I highly recommend this tub, especially if you have toddler who won't sit through baths!	3
"Item is ""as described"" as of 12/2010. No where does it say it is bulk packaging or retail packaging. Item arrived in 3 days in bulk packaging exactly like j. raftery's picture. Having owned this exact item 3 years ago, I am led to believe this is a genuine motorola item. Markings, feel, quality of coil cord, and genuine motorola accessory hologram sticker on tip of plug seem to be like my old one. Great price (around $5) and it works (HTC Incredible). I would recommend this item."	7
Like everyone says, the first three Spyro games on the PS1 were great classics and all the others suck.  Yes, PS2, GameCube, Xbox, Xbox 360, Wii, PS3, and Wii U all have bad Spyro Games.  The only good Spyro games are on PS1 and maybe GBA.  And I'm not just making this up I actually bought a used PS1 to play the original Spyro and I've played Legend of Spyro on my GameCube.  And even though I really like the GameCube, I hated Legend of Spyro.  On top of that, the most modern systems have even worse Spyro games.	23
The information on this product states that this item it will fit most RV's.  Not so, not even close.  There is no way to even motifiy this item to make it work.  Was a total waste of money.  I've had RV's for over 40+ years, and have never even seen a gutter even close to what this will fit.  Not even worth sending back due to the shipping return charges being more that this product cost.  Would not recommend this product to anyone. To bad you have even give it one star, in order to leave a review	2
My daughter goes through about 15-20 of these notebooks a year in High School. The last time we went to a B&M store to purchase them they were out of the College Ruled ones and only had Wide Ruled, which isn't accepted in her school. I was very happy and surprised to see that Amazon had them for less than $1, so I picked up the limit of three. They are now on the list of items I will order regularly, easy enough to add to any order I'm placing to avoid shipping them on their own and causing more wasted packaging.	17
I have been using this K&N filter in my 2012 Nissan Frontier 4x4 since the first oil change. The &#34;wrench-off&#34; feature is an awesome addition that all filters should have (in my opinion), and it makes taking the filter off easier if you unintentionally put a little too much &#34;stink&#34; on it the last oil change. After having used many other brands of filters in other vehicles, I'm pretty much sold on K&N and use their filters in both of my motorcycles as well. FYI - I use this filter in conjunction with Royal Purple 5W30.	2
I bought the Koss PortaPro Headphones to replace the earbuds for my MP3 player.  They're light, comfortable and have decent audio capabilities.  You can fold them up and put them in my pocket.  I'm generally satisfied with them and would make the purchase again.  My only gripe is that the earpieces tend to detach from the frame.  There's only a small notch and groove holding them together.  Reassembling them when the earpieces come off isn't a huge hassle, but it is annoying.	10
Pretty much the gold standard for dechlorinator. Added benefit of detoxifying ammonia. Note, it is only detoxified for 24-48 hours. It is not removed, it is made harmless to fish. I currently do daily dosing to be safe. Bacteria and plants can still use it in the detoxified state, so it does not stall a nitrogen cycle. Emergency nitrite dosing is also a great feature, but do not depend on that to save your fish during the cycle. Do a fishless cycle, do it right.	19
Water for Elephants is an awesome story about an engaging character that had me sneaking my kindle out at work to read a bit more.I loved it from start to finish. Some have criticized the amalgamation of the Jacob story from the Bible and post depression circuses but it works beautifully.The level of detail and insight into the train circus world shows an incredible amount of research but one of the most amazing things is none of those details come across as research. They are as natural to the story as the characters.	5
This pod if for an 'E.S.E.' adapter handle. 'Easy Serve Espresso'.And it is!Try a regular filter handle and you wind up with weak, mostly water, undrinkable liquid. Used correctly, it is the perfect amount for perfect shot.If ILLY is a bit too toasty, try the more mellow Lavazza. Rich and flavorful without too much acidity. Also produces excellent caramel-y crema.If you like to keep regular or decaf on hand for guests, single wrap ESE pods are perfect, no big can to use up quickly.	11
Bear and his friends sing and dance to introduce the concept of going to the toilet (or potty).  They tell how to know you need to go, and explain that sometimes there are accidents, but that it is worth it to wear underwear instead of diapers.  There are some real children who talk about how they love going to the toilet.  And a very strange shadow puppet rap showing that people all over the world go to the toilet.  Don't know about results yet, but at least it is an entertaining video.	6
They have a few of these out: One has a Vet you need to get out of the car lot, which I really like, and another is a limo, (there all worthy) of &quot;must haves&quot;... I only review and keep on my list top games for all ages that play perfect on KF, so if your looking for more and don't have the time to opean each one, simply check out my review list. Also for any question on anything, drop me a e mail, I'm here to help.. Enjoy!..	1
I gave Poirot, series 6, a top rating of 5 stars because David Suchet, as always, is stunningly delightful in the roll. When reading the original books, he is exactly what one envisions Poirot to be, making the films spring to life. And it doesn't hurt that the production company takes such care to make it a period piece, with housing, furnishings, costumes, manners, even idioms of speech, complete to the time frame. May Poirot's &#34;little grey cells&#34; never fail to delight one and all!	0
This is the tape to use when you need extra security for your shipping tasks.  Glass fiber and very strong adhesive combine to assure you that your package won't be breached before the recipient receives it.  I've deducted one star from my rating because this tape is rather expensive and because the roll is too large to fit onto my tape dispenser.  But you really can't go wrong with Scotch tape products, especially when compared to cheaper alternatives. And 55 meters is a lot of tape for most users.  Recommended for those important packages.	17
This is the perfect sized container for my dog's food.  I have a 15lb border terrier, and I buy a 13lb bag of food each time and can drop the whole thing in there (including the bag).  It's a perfect fit.  The lid seals the food up pretty good and it's easy to open and close.  I was skeptical at first when seeing how the latch was online, with the molded connectors on the back, but it's  pretty solid.	19
I finally broke down and got one of these after getting fed up at dragging my knuckles through the pizza with my old, small wheel cutter. Boy am I glad I did! This cutter works sooo much better. I don't know if it's sharper, or if it's because it has more heft, but it cuts right through those pizza crusts, like a charm.  I have also used it to cut pastry and dough and it works really well at that, too. Finally, it cleans up quickly easily. Definitely a great gadget every kitchen should have.	13
This stand is, all in all, pretty good. I have it underneath my bandsaw, which is a somewhat heavy tool.  When I step on the pedal and lift the stand onto the three wheels, it's rather top heavy and tippy when I roll it around.  I think the three wheel design might be better for a shorter tool with a lower center of gravity, like a jointer perhaps.The assembly is easy enough and I've had no problems with quality of the stand so I have nothing to say in that regard.Under a lighter/shorter tool I think this stand would be great.	21
"Beauty's Beast became a callous, unloving fop when he lost his beast form, and Beauty sets out on a quest to turn him back into the Beast she loved.While the story idea itself wasn't bad, the execution was awful. Ditchoff mixes tenses and flashbacks without regard to the poor reader trying to follow the storyline. She confuses words, such as ""bridal path"" for ""bridle path"" - both useful but NOT interchangeable. When a couple of dwarves come to Beauty's aid and accidentally uncover her ""ta-tas,"" I couldn't take any more."	14
Since we bought this when it was first on VHS (after watching the movie when it first opened) this is a replacement.The story is very cute as are the characters except for the villain, who's a cat. My daughter love this and used to watch it several times a month. It has remained one of her favorites even though she is now a SR in college (majoring in chemistry).The colors were vibrant and the animation is super! Voice talent was superb, including Dom Deluise. I would rate this a very high 9.0 to 9.25 out of 10 stars.I highly recommend this!!	6
"This is one of the best face wash ever!!! I had used many brands, many just leave your face with""too much""... slippery...or dry. My skin is combination, dry to normal, this is perfect for me. The smell is wonderful, nice. This product leaves my skin feeling soft and clean. Love it and highly recommend it. The seller is one of the fastest on delivery service, received my product in matter of 2 or 3 days, on standard shipping!!! Got an excellent product."	4
More importantly, the point is that the thing that goes in your ear is a cheap, thin little foam pad that will wear out very quickly.  When mine arrived, it was in little pieces all over the inside if the plastic bag they shipped it in.  No box, no packing - not even some cheap bubble wrap and a rubber band, just chucked it into a bag.  I realize it's super cheap but it should last a month.  Is there we are at now?  I wish Amazon would be... at all selective on what they offer for sale.	7
"This thing is ridiculous!  It holds a temperature better than my electric oven.  I can load it up with charcoal, set the vents, and it will be rock steady at 250 degrees for hours.  If you have a favorite BBQ restaraunt that you think is pretty good, try their best menu item and compare it to the ""Q"" you'll produce on this cooker and you'll never eat out again.  I've made baby back ribs, meatloaf, pork butt, spare ribs, and fatties (smoked sausage rolls) and they've all turned out delicious.  Buy it, you won't regret it."	18
My dog loves this toy.  It's the one chew toy he actually goes to again and again.  I would give it 5 stars, but I looked down one day and the toy was headless.  Where the head went I have a pretty good guess.  So, I would recommend the toy with the caveat that if your dog is a determined chewer that you probably shouldn't leave him unsupervised with the toy for extended periods of time (such as the amount of time it would take him to behead it).	19
I love British comedy. My only fault is that they seem too anxious to pull the trigger and move on. Knowing that only one season remains is tough. This show really has legs, and now it will be a Fox TV comedy. &#34;Us & Them&#34; if what I have read is correct. But can anybody give Nessa the edge that Ruth does? Doubtful.This show has plenty of laugh-out-loud moments. It really does have a magic to it. Do yourself a favor and dial it up.	0
"I've had my P-Touch labeler for years now, and I feel like I'm always labeling something: files, leftovers, kids' stuff.  But I only just now needed a new cartridge.  So don't hold back; label EVERYTHING!  These labels are high quality.  They stick until (unless) you remove them, then they come up without leaving any residue.  You can even restick them!  And because they are thermally activated, the ""ink"" won't smear if it gets wet.  I couldn't be more satisfied (except the backing is so hard to get off...)."	10
I love the new plantronics voyager 855. It pairs great with my Nokia N82. My only gripes are that the call/talk button can be difficult to press and the audio quality is good but not great. For audiophiles, the 855 wont cut it. But I think I can safely say that no BT headset has great audio. If fidelity is what you want, you favorite headphones are better suited for the job, but if you want to walk around town, make calls, and listen to tunes this headset is awesome. It has great audio isolation and decent sound quality.	7
I have this headset for work and use the band that wraps around the head instead of just the ear loop.  I find this is the most comfortable option for me.  The headset has been great and I have never had a problem with it since i have owned it (approx 2 years).  The range is great and I can get up from my desk and walk to the printer during a call no problem.  Overall I am very pleased with this headset and others in my office have purchased this based on my recommendation and they love it as well.	7
If I could Dance Naked in Times Square.  I would shout with big Boom Boom Drum.  Black Cumin Seed, Black Seed Oil, No more cold sores and get to know your triggers, deep fired salty foods, lack of sleep, stress, keep hydrated, etc.  But if I could shout and sing; I say google Black Seed Oil, it all natural Ancient Mediterranean herb, it next to a MIRACLE, forget honey, ACV, forget coconut oil, Google and try, cured my asthma too.  Forget pharmaceuticals, forget FDA approved, I say go 100% natural.	12
I purchased these for hiking primarily, but after wearing them for a day I wish I had a pair for every day of the week. They are extremely comfortable. I have sweaty feet and these certainly help wick the sweat away from my skin. Now the the weather is a bit cooler these are my go to socks. It's been about 2 months now and I wear these at least once a week, and they still look like new. Build quality seems to be very high and the padding is still think and comfy.	8
"The CD player in my car went haywire. CD's were skipping and others wouldn't play at all. Thought maybe it may need a ""clean up.""  WOW! Put this in the CD player...ran it twice. That's all it took. And to think, I was ready to pay to have a new one installed. Have to agree with others...don't buy a new CD player before trying this. Besides, the music on the CD isn't so bad either...yes...there's music on the CD cleaner."	10
We put this in our vegetable garden about a week ago and so far no deer or rabbits. Our poor neighbors had all of their tomatoes and spinach eaten by the Deer and the Rabbits the day after we used this, so I would say that is a pretty good indication.  My husband said applying was easy and the sprayer worked great.  So at this point, the product does what it says and so I recommend.  If anything changes and the Deer show back up, I'll post another review.*Added bonus, I LOVE that the ingredients are all very natural or I wouldn't have used.	18
"Honestly, all individuals are born different from the other. In G3's situation the 3 of them have their own distinctive feeling & style in playing that would obviously lift you up from your seats and scream out loud the word ""Yeah"". That is why I would not and could not classify who is ranking no.1, 2, or 3 among them. Unless, if your head is inflated with fowl air then approach me and I'm 100% willing to deflate your pathetic medical case and grant you guarantees of cure comprise of ""Love & Respect"". Buy this Dvd because your in for a special treat."	6
"I like the taste of this product. It's sweet, fruity, chewy and creamy. Unlike many energy bars, it wasn't difficult to eat. Buyers should be aware that each bar has 24g of sugar(5.7 teaspoons)and 210 calories.  If you have food allergies you should know the bars contain nuts(almonds, peanuts) and soy, and it states that it is ""made on equipment that processes wheat"".  The bars also contain from 20% - 100% of the RDA of many vitamins and minerals, something to think about if you take vitamin/mineral supplements. I think I would eat them occasionally for a quick energy boost."	12
I enjoy reading these books with my 2YO. The words are short, the illustrations are entertaining and the story doesn't drag on to bore him. He is able to turn the pages and tell me the story by just looking at the pictures! He is especially fascinated by the animals- goose, moose, mouse, pig...and always giggles at &#34;kick the stone&#34;- for whatever reason. Lol.I am completely happy with this purchase and would definitely recommend this as an addition to any toddler's bookshelf!If you do buy this and it's a hit, consider alsoGo, Dog! Go!Are you my mother?Big Dog, Little Dog	5
I love the book that comes with it. I tried one of those mail order courses, and it nearly crushed my love of electronics. I didn't try and for a while. I decided to try it with smaller kits instead. This starts off like that course did, and I seem to remember something from it. This is far better though. I'm nervous about trying to start soldering. This kit doesn't include soldering (that I know of anyway). The durability is horrible though. It should be on a sturdier frame, and a better battery holder.	22
"It was with some reluctance that I purchased this book.  I'm more of a character-driven reader than a plot-driven one. Additionally, I don't especially like ""adventure"" stories. I was pleasantly surprised since Jacob was such a terrific character, and any adventure he encountered was worth reading.  This book certainly entertains -- and, it moves so fast. Also, the pictures of real circus life added to the story. Two people are currently waiting for this.  I trust that they'll have as good a read/ride as I did.  Loved Gruen's writing & expect to be reading more of her books."	5

I have always had cheap potato mashers that either bent or broke.  But, like most things, you get what you pay for.  This is why I decided to go with this one.  It doesn't bend or flex when you are mashing, and I use it for potatoes as well as other things like bananas and beans.  I wash it in the dishwasher and have had no problems.  A little pricey, but you might as well get something quality that will last a long time.	13
This is a good blue tooth. I can hear great with this product. My husband had a problem with it, that is wasn't load enough for him. He drives truck. Just a little bulky for my taste. This is the first blue tooth I had when I got my first blue tooth compatible phone. Had lots of them.The only draw back is. They only lasted about six months and we had to get new one. And the product does pick up allot of background noise. But it does work well. Would recommend this to others.	7
This app is reason enough to get an Android device.  The information it provides regarding channel usage on both the 2.4 and 5 GHz bands is essential if you want to set up devices and wifi routers for the best possible performance.  Sure, you can get fancier products from Fluke and others, but if you go that route you'll pay hundreds of dollars and have more junk to tote around.For most Android apps there are several functional alternatives.  Wifi Analyzer stands alone.The associated Wifi Connector Library is useful if you want one-click sign-ons to different networks.	1
This will shave all nose/ear hair. Wet/Dry and waterproof, completely portable, there is nothing not to like.  It does everything it should with no errors.  Hard to imagine this product any better.Edit:The above is my original review.  One year later, it is broken.  I have since switched to the Grommmate stainless steel and manual trimmer, which is cheaper and just as effective, albeit slower; it is also less likely to break.In short:  this device works great, until... it stops working.	12
Downloaded this game the first week after Christmas and have been praying Amazon and Optime would fix this for the Fire. No such luck.Even though it appears that you are unable to play, you can, the actual board (as in working) is in the upper left quadrant of the game board.  Tap just off the uppermost left to find the invisible working grid.Anyway, my daughter loves to play it even broken the way it is.Question for other Kindle users, are any apps ever updated??	1
extremely versatile.  the conical end pulls outward and functions as a ratchet, cranking the straps/clips taught.  A few minutes of one-time configuration/setup is needed and future mount/removals are accomplished in seconds.  The only reason i didn't give these a 5 star rating is the small foam discs tend to come off the mounting bases periodically (they press against the outside of your existing mirror).  Thoughtfully, the vendor includes extras.  All in all, a very unique and functional product!	2
These are a great price, and my dogs can't get enough of them!  I give them as gifts occasionally to friends with dogs, and they find their dogs love them as well.  I highly recommend.  I have two German Shepherd mixes (one with jaws of steel I think) and they stand up to the test.  Eventually they are worn down to nothing, but that usually takes 2 or 3 months, even with my more active chewer.Warning though, you don't want to step on these in the middle of the night!	19
I do live shows online, and my older Behringer mixer does not have the built in USB port, so these digitizers do a great job for me.  I constantly get comments about how clean and clear my sound is, and while I largely attribute that to the mixer, this digitizer is just as important a link in the chain.  Very simple to use, audio out of the mixer goes into this digitizer, plug the USB cable into my computer, my streaming software sees it, and people hear me.  I am definitely a Behringer fan.	16
So many of Mel's movies are not politically correct and are edited very heavily for TV, in some cases with a loss of some of the essential humor.  They still hold up on disc completely unedited.  This is now the best way to see the master cinematic humorist of the 20th century in all his glory.  Mel Brooks left NYC so the elite film critics moved on to Woody Allen.  Allen was/is giggle and smirk humorous, when Brooks slap you leg, fall on the floor hilarious.Mel Brooks is funny and must be seen without the man telling you what you are allowed laugh at.	15
My aunt the music teacher recommended this metronome and we really like it. It's been in heavy use (1+ hours per day) ever since we got it many months ago and I don't think we've even had to replace the batteries yet. It's got a good loud sound and is easy for my kids to adjust. We tried out some free metronome apps but the volume wasn't loud enough and my kids (though very adept at touch screens) found them tricky to adjust. This one is great.	16
This book was captivating from page 1.  The story kept a good pace and is one of those books you just don't want to put down.  I really connected with the main character and felt his emotions as if they were my own.  Other characters were both likable and despicable, but all the while intriguing.  A very interesting story and enlightening as well.  I can imagine life on a circus train during the depression and realize now that it was not all it was cracked up to be.  Highly recommend!	5
Hey it's 30 bucks(roundabout). For that, the setup was trouble-free, and using it was a cinch. But personally, I wish for two things: that it wasn't colored white, cuz it get's dirty real easy. U leave it on top of your monitor, the dust collects and......Also, when I used Netmeeting, no matter how much I tried to focus, the pciture wasn't entirely clear. But again, for it's price, this camera is a sweet deal, and pretty cool looking too!	10
You can call Phenomina all the words in the book in the 1st hour and 30 minutes.  Silly, baddly acted, dumb, unscarry and has a  paper thin plot but the last 1/2 hour is like a knockout punch. For those familiar with his work it is like he takes the last 1/2 hour of Suspiria and crunches all the tension down to 15 minutes.  The only bad thing is getting past the 1st hour and 1/2, but don't worry, the ending is killer(like in most Argento movies).	15
I bought this replacement cutting head when it was available as a deal of the day from this website.  The cost was great and my electric razor wasn't doing its job anymore.  A few days later and I had the replacement cutting head.  It took less then 5 minutes to remove, clean and replace the cutting head with the new replacements.  Now my razor cuts as good as new.  Next time these come up as a deal of the day, I'll buy another set as a spare.	12
It's been 5 months aleady and we've had no troubles at all.  It leaked the first time we used it because I didn't snap the locks into place all the way. My boys are quite big for their age, and they love to kick their legs and splash around. There is plenty of room for that.  In the beginning I put the tub on my bathroom counter, but when they started splashing water all over the place, I put this tub in our regular bath. I don't use the sling anymore, but it wasn't a problem when we did.	3
i enjoyed reading this book. Although it will not go down in the ranks of a great American Classic, it is still agood read. There was a feeling for the desperation of the period, and the atypical lives of the circus. Some of the characterizations were a bit shallow and somewhat predictable, the plot manages to keep the reader engaged. I enjoyed the contrasting chapters of the young protagonist and his later, elderly self. The ending is sweet, but quite unplausible. All of these things considered, I still gave this book an overall 4 rating.	5
"I've used the Olay Regenerist cleanser, St. Ives scrub, Neutrogena, Estee Lauder, Ahava - need I go on? But I really like this Aveeno scrub (though ""scrub"" is a bit of an overstatement considering how small the beads are). I like the citrusy smell and the way it cleans gently. I wish it were a little more scrubby but I can't seem to find something that's about half way between this and the super-rough St. Ives so I'll stick with this until I do."	4
I didn't realize this book had been out for so long when I ordered it from Amazon.  Can't believe I hadn't heard of it before because it was a fantastic book I should have picked up sooner.  I think a movie is being made about the book, but I am glad I read the book first.  It's a quick read for a lazy Sunday afternoon. Definitely entertaining.  After I finished it, I felt like I was still transported back to the 1930's circus, and it took several hours to stop thinking about it.  Worth reading for sure.	5
I ordered this Fobus 9mm/.40 S&W; for use with my Glock 17 magazines.  It fits into place comfortably and securely.  I don't feel that it will ever slip.  It took some getting used to when bending over and the like, but otherwise it's magic.  You can do a handstand and the mags will never fall out of their slots, yet when you want to draw one, it slides out with ease.Fobus knows how to make holsters (gun or mag); get this one with the paddle for ease of donning (and doffing).  Fantastic item for the price!	20
I use this stuff like it was ketchup, honestly. It goes with everything. Hoisin is awesome on chinese food, thai food, vietnamese food, its good with hamburgers, fries, and even with steak instead of steak sauce. Hoisin is sweet, and salty and has this certain kick to it that makes it unique amoung condiments. The first time i ever saw it used was when i was watching PBS Yan Can Cook, and he busted out the Lee Kum Kee bottle and i was mesmerized with its rich brown color, and Yan Can do no wrong with me!!!!	11
I had been using my screaming, ear-killing ShopVac for dust collection on my router table until I bought this adapter.  Now I use my quiet, absolutely wonderful JET 1100 cfm dust collector (see that review),  connected to the hose from my ShopVac through this adapter.  I can actually  hear my router now!This will adapt your 2 1/2&quot; vacuum hose to your  4&quot; dust collection hose.  I can even vacuum the floor without going  deaf now!  Such a cheap improvement; your ears will thank you!	21
I would say the gameboy color was the best hand held game system I ever owned or play. Something that you grew up using will stick to you forever. I still play my gameboy evey now and then, playing games that never get old like pokemon. The only thing I ever had bad to say about the gameboy color was that it does not have a back light and I have to use a worm light. If you ever owned a gameboy in your life it's something that you always keep with you or end up buying another one like me.	23
I needed to get this external USB dvd/cd device, for a laptop I have that doesn't have a cd/dvd drive in it. I was very pleased when this arrived, and it didn't need any set up. All I had to do was hook it to the laptop, and it worked very smoothly and easily. This is a solidly good product, and for a good price, and so far it is working very well. However I felt that it is a bit sensitive to the touch when it is working, so the user has to be a little careful with it.	10
use on 2cameras and cell phone.  The cutting is fairly straight forward, but the pre-cut edge that is supposed to help with seperating the backing from the protector is not cut well so i've wasted one sheet as it ripped easily while taking off the backing.  material not durable at all.  Got scratches just by using the squeegy in the package.  Lastly, if you had to reposition it, good luck getting the bubbles (hazyness) out.  Requires too much effort to get it right.  Would not recommand it.	7
Great game for several reasons1. Fully cooperative game with a 20 sided dice, cards, modular and random game board, and a host of miniatures that represent both heroes AND monsters/bosses.2. Can combine with the Wrath of Ashardalon game or Dungeon Command games' miniatures3. RPG-lite. No huge time investment or setup needed like the real D&D; RPGs, though it could be considered a negative if you were looking for a deep character development system and role playing experience, but if you were you shouldn't look at board games in the first place.	22
Wanted to change the fuel filter out and only use ACDelco on the truck when I can grab one. The install of this filter is easy but be forewarned, you will get some gas on you so be sure to use gloves and something to catch anything that spills from the fuel lines. Install usually takes less than 30 minutes and be sure to use FUEL/BRAKE line wrenches on this because you can easily round off the fuel line fittings. Thanks Amazon for carrying ACDelco, it helps me avoid picking these up from the dealership.	2
I use this for everything; back pain, sore muscles, sprains, it works great on them all! It doesn't smell great, but not any worse than icy hot or something like that and you don't have to get it all over your hands to apply it. It feels sort of cool when you put it on, but warms up a la icy hot after a bit...but it really does help the soreness go away! I carry it in my purse for those moments when my back acts up and I need instant relief- definitely a great buy!	12
You can't go wrong with Scotch products.  I knew when I ordered this tape that it would do the job.  I use masking tape for paint projects, mostly.  This tape holds strong and tight and worked wonderfully when painted over.  The width is just perfect for me.I also like to use masking tape for hanging posters in the kid's rooms, rather than using push-pins.  I make a small roll of tape for each corner on the backside of each poster.  This tape is wide enough and strong enough for that use as well.	17
"The pad is sort of OK - it's much smaller and thinner than advertised. I would say this is roughly the equivalent of the 79-cent mouse pads I can get at my local dollar store.The product description says the size is 9x8The technical details say the size is 9.5x8The size shipped to me is actually 9x7.75I guess it's kind of a quibble, but the pad I received is smaller than what was advertised.  It's also less than 1/8"" thick as well.And, no, I wouldn't buy another."	17
This has always been and still is my favorite Christmas movie of all time.  I had it on VCR but had to switch over to DVD (probably have to switch again a decade or two from now).  I am in my 40's and still love to watch this very short movie at Christmas time.  With all of the advancements in animation these days, it is hard to convince my daughters that this is worth watching but it is the STORY that gets me every time.  They actually are learning to enjoy watching it with me.	15
Without a doubt the best Resident Evil game ever made, &quot;Code: Veronica&quot; will amaze you with it's beauty, and scare the hell out of you with it's zombie shooting action.  The graphics are super superb, looking almost movie like and giving you such a surreal feeling its like your interacting with a movie rather than playing a game.  And like true horror should be, there's plenty of thrills, chills, and a hell of a lot of spills to behold.  Never has being scared senseless been so fun.  Essential for the Dreamcast owner.	23
Sonic Heroes will be EXTREMELY AWESOME!!!!!!!!  I haven't played it yet, but I know it will be great, and hopefully the bad camera views from the Adventure series will be vanished.When I say A blast from the past, I mean that Sonic Heroes is one of his old games, blown up into 3D, (New stages, of course...)I can't think of anything else to put!  Just get Sonic Heroes when it comes out cuz IT'TL ROCK!	23
Syphon Filter is a good 3rd person shooter with stealth elements.  People have to remember that this was one of the early 3d games that tried to incorporate stealth elements, so it is not as smooth as some of today's games, but it is still pretty well done in my opinion. The game has its flaws, but was a very fun game and the difficulty was just right.  Not too easy and the boss fights were pretty sweet and did require multiple attempts on my part.  I have the disc version for the PS1, so I cannot comment on the digital version.	23
Best streaming radio app ever.  Better than IHeart, Pandora, and even Jango, my previous favorite.  As a Baby Boomer, I can't stand current music and only listen to the music I grew up with. I love the station selection on XiiaLive Pro. It works great on Kindle Fire.  My fave station is Fun 45's.com. If you were born in the 50's,  you'll love it too. Well worth the price.  No adds, no commercials, no problems at all, just great music.	1
This is not a typical fantasy story, it's a never ending series of well-described events involving perfectly profiled characters in a wonderful setting.It's hard to grasp, you usually forget half of what you read and to be honest it doesn't matter.  You could skip 100 pages and keep on reading as if nothing.It's like life.  Not everything happens for a reason, the sequence of events is unpredictable, follows no moralistic or predictable model and you can either hate it or get used to it.  I decided to be the latter.	5
I love this game! I am really addicted to this one. This is really an open racer. If there is traffic, instead of there being only 1 root, you can turn down alleys or other roads. I am not going to comment much about the  features, someone has already probably written them, but i have 2 problems  with this game. 1. The mapped are of Chicago is too small. 2. There are too  little cars Besides that i really love this game, and you should buy this  game!	23
"I recommend getting the extension that goes with this gate to make it big enough.  Our baby never liked to be penned in anywhere, but we use it to gate off the ""band area"" of the basement.  It doesn't need to be connected to itself to function well.  If you do plan to connect it in an enclosable shape, it takes a little getting used to the connection mechanism.  My husband has no problem with it at all.  It's very versatile, and I recommend it."	3
The product is as advertised - a genuine OEM Motorola battery. It looks exactly the same as the original battery that came with the phone. So it's not a generic brand. Works great too. Somehow the package got lost in the mail (or the seller forgot to send it?). But after I contacted the seller a replacement arrived within the next few days. Though the package looked beat-up or had been in the ditch the content was intact. Great and speedy customer care to make up for a mistake.	7
My pitbull mix loves her hedgehog, and although she destroys most toys in time, this lasts weeks (a lot longer than most and certainly than most soft toys).  This is probably because the fur on it is so dense that it is enjoyable to squeeze in her mouth and is a deterrent from locating and removing the squeaker immediately.  This is the only soft toy I now buy her, and ranks amongst her large Kong squeaker toys as one of her favorites.  Endless hours of fun and like photos already posted, she will sleep with her head on it.	19
I needed strong drink to wash my mouth out after sitting through POTC, the most distasteful film I've ever seen.  The only benefit from watching it was the sense of duty to warn others off. Like incinerating an insect under a magnifying glass, Gibson accentuates a few verses in the story of the last week of Jesus into a gruesome, disgusting, gratuitous gorefest.  Maybe it helps one's appreciation to believe that Jesus died for our sins (which I don't), but even in that case, I don't think that Gibson's relentless portrayal of violence adds much to the magic.	15
I like shooting my revolver because I don't have to chase the brass, like I do with my semi-automatic pistols. The downside is the awkwardness of the reload process.This device removes that awkwardness. Just open and drop my old brass into a bag or bucket then seat all 5 bullets at once with this device and I'm off again.For the range I can pre-load these and set them on the bench in front of me. For carrying, couple this with the speed loader case and you are prepared for whatever comes.This is an ingenious little device!	20
I passed over this book many times but one day decided to take a chance. I was not expecting such a great read. Read the entire book in a day and was left wanting more. Such as, did they ever find Walter's and Camel's body after the train stopped? Did they ever capture or prosecute Blackie and his gang for murder? Wish I knew more. Maybe there will be a second book later. Meantime, for those of you not steeped in elitist review criticism, this book is a wonderful surprise.	5
"I recently backtracked and played all of the earlier Tomb Raider games. (avoid Angel of Darkness.  Horrible game)  TR2 is about as fun as they come. Graphics are outdated of course, but there is so much to do and to much fun to be had.  The game is long, keeps your interest, has plenty of cool weapons, and a good story.  I'd love to see this game redone with today's technology.  ""10 out of 10"".If you're a TR fan and haven't played this, I'd advise that you do."	23
This game is interesting.  My sister made me pick it up and it is fun to mess around with.  If you are looking for a cute little adventure platformer then this is it.  The graphics are good and the control isn't too tricky.  It does get difficult in parts but not overly.  I am not a huge fan of platform games but this one got me with its unique humorous tones.  Give it a shot on your PS2 if you haven't.  It's a bargain.	23
I loved this short story, Morgan has wanted her boss for a year but since she's the original tomboy/girl next door, she hasn't been able to get up the courage to let him know she's interested. Finally she decides to dress the part and it really works.The plot was good, the action is fast and furious and there really is a story. The entire story happens within a few hours but it's well paced and well written and above all the price is right!  I like Ms. Jacobs!	14
I am a worship arts pastor in Pennsylvania. Normally, on an album like this. I am able to find 3 or 4 songs that I really like or really think would work well in our worship services. On this album, for the first time, I am having a very hard time finding even one or two that WOULDN'T work well in our services.Chris is a very gifted songwriter, the band it tight, the sound is great. Whether just listening, using for your own private worship, or using as a resource for a church... It's a SERIOUS winner!	6
I love this album, but from a purely technical perspective I have to admit it lies somewhere in between spoken word, a vegas cover act, and torture. It's awful, but hysterically awful.Shatner can't sing either. However, like Plan 9 from Outer Space, it's so nonsensical, it borders on great. I mean really, who thought setting up the theme from Cyrano and Mr. Tambourine Man as a medley was a good idea? His Mr. Tambourine Man is the most hysterically awful cover. Ever. The arrangement sounds like Mr. Tambourine Man does broadway, constipated.Spend the dollar.	6
I used this line on four salmon trips in September out of Westport, Wa.  The charter skippers were great at finding salmon, and when I hooked fish, this line just did its job and never gave me a concern.  I used the 20 lb. clear line.  It easily handled the 8-12 lb. Coho we were lucky to find and catch.  It's rather nicely limp and smooth in the reel, and it cooperates when you tie knots. If you need monofilament, this is a good choice.	20
The description doesn't say the capacity of this thing and I couldn't believe how big it was when I received it. I didn't even try it out..returned it and am waiting for the mini version. Unless you need a huge amount of lettuce or anything else..beware of how large it is. It is hard to store, the storage lid that you use instead of the spinning one to store veggies in the refridgerator is NO LONGER SOLD ON eBAY. That was disappointing as well. Seems like a good product otherwise...	13
I gave up my membership to a warehouse store last year, as I didn't use it enough.  One thing I did use it for, however, was for these large cans of Coffee-Mate creamer.  I can't find them anyplace else and they were a decent bargain at the warehouse store.Amazon offers a competitive price on this product, with delivery through prime membership.Coffee-Mate creamer is rich and creamy.  It dissolves easier than cheaper brands.  I like the powder form, as the liquid makes the coffee too cool.  So I am happy with this product and this purchase!	11
This was actually the boyfriend's purchase since he wanted to try black (his hair is naturally black) instead of the clear which is all he can find in stores around here.His opinion was that clear is a lot better even though you have to work it in to make sure it doesn't show up because the black is too messy (i.e. it's black and tends to get on everything.)It'd probably be good if you wanted to darken your moustache/beard though.Aside from that he likes Clubman's and I have to say it makes his beard look much nicer...keeps his beard in control.	12
